Planetwise Flannel Wipes,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",3
Planetwise Wipe Pouch,it came early and was not disappointed. i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder. it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak. highly recommend it.,5
Annas Dream Full Quilt with 2 Shams,Very soft and comfortable and warmer than it looks...fit the full size bed perfectly...would recommend to anyone looking for this type of quilt,5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.",5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!",5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn\'t have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.",5
A Tale of Baby\'s Days with Peter Rabbit,"Lovely book, it\'s bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby\'s feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I\'m not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you\'re not home.The only reason this isn\'t a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.,4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter\'s sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby\'s day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby\'s nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny\'s comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn\'t sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it\'s hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This book is perfect!  I\'m a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it\'s small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I\'m getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I\'m with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it\'s a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn\'t a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven\'t used this thing at all, and here\'s why:1.) When you\'re breastfeeding, it\'s often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don\'t nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You\'re also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I\'d forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I\'m not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).",3
Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"Space for monthly photos, info and a lot of useful stickers come with it. It is exactly what I wanted!!",5
Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.",4
Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby\'s firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.",5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.,5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I completed a calendar for my son\'s first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he\'s still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it\'s something to keep recording all those special moments!,4
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,We wanted to get something to keep track of our child\'s milestones and this is a cute option. There aren\'t many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.,5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month\'s picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!",5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It\'s an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren\'t very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",2
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son\'s second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn\'t want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature\'s lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it\'s super cute and brat for either gender.,5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap.",3
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies",5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!,5
Baby\'s First Journal - Green,"Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn\'t engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he\'s older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.,3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","One of baby\'s first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I\'d like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)",4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can\'t wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It\'s so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It\'s so nice that she can\'t bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like ""daddy,"" ""mommy,"" ""puppy,"" etc.  We love it.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn\'t like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.,4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!",3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",What a great book for babies!  I\'d been looking for books which couldn\'t be damaged by my 10-month old\'s drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn\'t have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He\'s nearly two now and he doesn\'t look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I\'d say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own.",5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,,5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,My son likes brushing elmo\'s teeth. Almost too nice of a book to let the kids play with haha :),5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,This was a birthday present for my 2 year old grandchildren.  They love this book and will sit and go through it page by page themselves .  The pictures are imaginative and appeal to young children.  Would buy it again!,5
"SoftPlay Giggle Jiggle Funbook, Happy Bear","This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it\'s something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can\'t even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it\'s going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!",2
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I\'m happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and ""reads"" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is ""Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo"" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful.  Lastly, who doesn\'t love Elmo!",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books. This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative.",4
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It\'s soft.  It\'s safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.,4
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"My 3 month old son loves this book. We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read. And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure.",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,Very cute interactive book! My son loves this book! The bright colorful illustrations make this great for babies & toddlers.,5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","Bought for granddauchildren and they play with them all the time.  Love reading to them.  Soft, so if they fall on them, they are safe. When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present.",5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn\'t break the bank.",4
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Love",This book is boring. Nothing to stimulate my granddaughter. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend it,1
SoftPlay Baby\'s First Cloth Books Gift Set,"It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic. EXACTLY what we were looking for!!When we teach our 1 year old what a ""lion"" is, we want to show him a REAL lion... not a drawing that looks nothing like a real lion.",5
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Hugs","for the young child, very cute...so happy they can &#34; read&#34; something there is little or no chance of them destroying..many happy reading memories",5
SoftPlay Baby Animals of the World Soft Cloth Book,"not bad but not as interesting to my 1-year old as I thought. Mot interactive [texture, etc] but cute anyway",3

Baby\'s First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby\'s &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.,5
Baby\'s First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Absolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.  I purchased the Baby Boy version for my grandson when he was born and my daughter-in-law was thrilled to receive the same book again.,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loved it. Simple but a place to put important memories down. I loved the verses at bottom of pages.,4
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"I didn\'t realize this was a religious product, so I almost returned it.  (Not that I have anything against that, but some of the pages ask for favorite scripture, prayers for the baby, etc.). Wasn\'t sure that fir with out lifestyle, but the book has all the right ages for memories, so we are keeping it.",3
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,OMG.....we loved this baby book! Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"Beautiful book, I love it to record cherished times in my great granddaughters life with the beautiful pastel pink color.",5

My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  ""My Kindergarten Year"". It is the perfect way to record one\'s Kindergarten experience through photographs and detailed descriptions of this very important time in your child\'s life. The questions are fun for your child to answer and record while serving its purpose for the parent.I\'d recommend this book to everyone with a Kindergartener.",5
My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,I\'m so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.,5
Jellycat Elephant and Mouse Book,The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he\'s older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character,4
God Created Everything Nite Lite,"This is well made a very pretty,.  It gives a nice light and will be used for years...I recommend it highly.  It also makes a great gift.",5

Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Colorful Butterflies,Would not purchase again or recommend. The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.,2
Modern House Winnie the Pooh Swing and Tiger Swing (2 pages) removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don\'t &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.,5

Reusable Flannel (15) Baby Wipes 100% Cotton Bleached and Unbleached (Flushable Diaper Liners),I love these wipes.  They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I\'ll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I\'m ordering more of them right now!,5
Beautiful Girl and Black Flower Removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"It is nice and looks great on my wall. It was just a bit smaller than what I thought, but that was my fault and not taking the measurements.",4
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn\'t learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...,4
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),These were  good quality--worked fine--heavy duty--able to be used in any way needed and filled my need as no others,2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),A great safety pin that has lots of uses.  Easy to find with bright colors and a great bargain for a dozen.,5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"While the diaper pins are attractive, the metal in the pins I received are flimsy and did not hold up to the thick fabric I used them on. Fortunately there was no baby involved, so no little on was stuck.",2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"These diaper pins went to Honduras to hold the cloth diapers we also sent with the missionaries. It is difficult to find diaper pins in our &#34;disposable&#34; age. In Honduras, they do not have &#34;Pampers&#34;. They appreciated the kits we sent.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery\'re working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don\'t have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"The steel part is not strong at all, unlike the old diaper pins, which I still have.  Very hard to work it through a thicker fabric.  Would not recommend.",1
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.,2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"Like = sharp ends that pierce through my diapers easier.  Dislike = the sides bend which is a pain.  That said, I am pushing them through older velcro tabs because the velcro on my diapers doesn\'t work anymore.",4

Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind,I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn\'t make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don\'t make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.,3
Super Mario Game Nintendo Wall Sticker and Decal,These do not stick to the wall. They start to peel as soon as you stick them to the wall.,1
New Style Trailing Cherry Blossom Tree Decal Removable Vinyl Kids Wall Decal Wall Sticker Peel and Stick,Was so excited to get this product for my baby girls bedroom!  When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!  Ended up having to super glue it to the wall...very disappointing.  I wouldn\'t waste the time or money on it.,1
Blessed By Pope Francis Franciscan Knotted Our Lady of Grace Italian Made Aurora Borealis Crystal Rosary,"I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat.",5
Blessed By Pope Francis Infant Jesus of Prague Nino De Praga Medal Charm Pendant,An excellent value and quality for the price.  Just right for wearing around the neck orattaching to a Brown Scapular or some such. And the Blessing makes the Item all the more Precious.,5
Musical Christmas Nativity Scene Angel with Baby Jesus in a Rustic Barkwood Resin Manger 8&quot; Tall,I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don\'t know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music,3

I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn\'t have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand. Overall satisfied with product and fast shipping!,4

"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red",I like those bibs. they are very useful. easy to wash and dry. the price is awesome. My friends also like them very much.,4
"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red","This bibs provided very good protections for messy eaters, my grandson is a 20 months old beautiful boy who loves to eat his marinara pasta with his fingers.

Holy Family Baby Jesus and Star Nativity Christmas Tree Ornament,"This is such a cute ornament, I collect nativity ornaments and this is perfect for my collection! Can\'t wait to add it to my nativity tree!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This book is going to be a life saver! We are adopting and when we travel complete the adoption, I needed a book to keep track of baby\'s schedule. I have a terrible memory and this book will be perfect for keeping track of baby\'s schedule. I also love how there is a spot at the beginning for emergency numbers and important info. Perfect for traveling, the babysitter or just for at home use. I will definitely be buying more after I fill this up.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Love it love it love it!!  Got my first baby tracker as a gift, bought another one as soon as it was used up.  Great for daycare, too, so you can communicate with your provider about baby\'s activities for the day.  Also great for round the clock care- no need to ""remember"" when baby ate last or how much sleep you really got!!  Get it for your new moms- to- be!!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby\'s routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn\'t have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn\'t even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I\'ve bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby\'s day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I got this baby tracker as part of the \'new parents\' package from my work. It is extremely well organized ... much better then others I\'ve seen. It is an iParenting Media Winner and for a good reason. Absolutely worth the $$. I am getting this for all my expecting friends! 5 starts!,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I\'m a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby\'s daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby\'s patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",Love this book ....super easy to keep track and sooooooooo helpful for this first time mom ..especially for pediatrician appts,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I loved how this book was set up to keep track of everything important about baby.  I used it for the first year.  I always took it to doctor appointments to share how often she was eating and everything.,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I\'ve been using it since I have my newborn and it\'s a great way to keeping track of baby&#34;s schedule,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I used a tracker with my first son - but I didn\'t so much need to with my second.  This tracker though, is laid out very well and keeps things pretty organized.  My only complaint is that it is not a full year tracker - I did the whole first year with my first son which is nice to refer back to.  I would recommend this book, but if you\'re interested in tracking the whole first year you will need to buy 3 (they run 4 months long).",4
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It\'s also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it\'s a great gift!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I rarely write a review however, this journal has been a lifesaver.  Sleep deprivation can compromise anyones ability to recall feeding and napping times, which breast was last used, soiled diapers, etc.. I even sleep with my journal to keep it close by so I can document around the clock.  The layout of this journal is very simple and easy to use at a quick glance.  I understand there are phone apps that do the same thing however, I chose this journal to allow my husband and nanny to have access to the information.  A must have and will make a great gift.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I received this at my baby shower and it has been a wonderful gift. I had no idea when I received it what fun it would be to record all this information. I have done this for 2 children now and only wish I would have had it for my first 2 kids.,5
"Large Jungle Animals (Panda, Lion, Elephant, Gorilla) - 3D Wall Murals for Baby Nursery and Kids Rooms - Made in USA",I ordered these for my 7 month old sons play area.  They are very cool.  I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!,5
Edu-Petit Happy Jungle Day Finger Puppet Book Developmental Toy,My 2 year old grandson got it for Christmas and he loves when his Mommy reads it to him.  Good quality and very well made.  Other positive reviews directed me to buy it.,5
Edu-Petit Teddy Bobo\'s Big Learning Book Developmental Toy,"I bought this for my 17 month old son as a form of quiet, in-crib entertainment when he wakes up at 5am. So far, he likes it a lot... even got an ""ooooooh"" when I first handed it to him.",4
Modern House Thomas Train and Friends removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"i hung these over my sond headboard in his thomas themed room, they havent fallen off the wall, applied a week ago so maybe they will be okay but they seemed kinda cheaply made. they do look good and as i said they havent fallen down, if they do i will be sure to revise my review to avoid anyone else making my mistake.",3
Modern House White Plum Blossom with Green Birds Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"a little difficult if you dont know how you want it to be placed on your wall, so be creative, it comes off easily so you can play around with it.. the result looks beautiful. very peaceful.",5

Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I haven\'t put these up yet but I was disappointed in the color of the flowers. They look more purple than pink.,2
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"the instructions were really clear, howerver the next day the decals started coming off because my wall has ridges on it soooo. I added a little dab of crazy glue and walah! it\'s up.",5
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,The designs were cut and easy to apply. There was no sticky residue when we peeled it off to readjust and it was to redo the adjustment again and again. It was also just sticky enough to stick to the wall while not too sticky enough to peel the paint off. We like it.,5
Modern House Angry Bird I removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"Grandchildren opened these before they got home and stuck them to everything in my house, even themselves. Hope they will still stick on wall when they get home.",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin\' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it\'s her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.,5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they\'re missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck,3
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Our whole family loved the Mozart music blocks. I even bought another &quot;disk&quot; of music. Unfortunately, it was a constant challenge to keep the kids from destroying the delicate &quot;chip&quot; that was easily accessible. Finally it broke and I felt it was too expensive to replace. I feel that a toy at this price should be more durable. My suggestion would be to hide the &quot;plug in chip&quot; so that the kids aren\'t attracted to it. We have a 3-year old and a one-year old. The toy lasted about 6 months.",4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn\'t put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don\'t think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind.",4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable.  After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken.  What a disappointment!!  And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur.",1
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old.  They both loved it.  I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working.  We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work.  It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.,4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"I spent [a lot of money] when this thing first came out, and it worked TERRIBLY!  I sent it back to the company because it was defective and wouln\'t shut up.  They sent me another one.  It worked very inconsistently.  When I called the manufacturer I was told ""Well, it\'s a very sensitve computer, you can\'t just let them toss it around, that must be why you\'re having trouble""  Actually, I was having my 2 year sit in his high chair while I supervised him, and he was not doing anything to it.  I mean, it says it\'s for 2 year olds on the box....  Anyway, I returned it and got my money.  SAve your money for real music lessons.",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.,5
"Milestones, Kids\' Step Stone Kit",Product was very easy to use.  I helped my son (16 months at the time) make a stepping stone for Father\'s Day.  He put the stones in himself and it turned out really cute.,5
Sesame Street Baby Purse Playset,"My girls love this Sesame Street purse! There are 5 items that can be placed inside of the purse. They use it when they pretend to go shopping around the house. It was a little tricky for my 18 month old to figure out how to open it but she eventually learned. The bright colors, durable design and sweet Sesame Street character faces make it such a fun purchase!",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He loves all the little animals, but even now at 8 months, he doesn\'t seem interested in putting them in the fish bowl.  However, he will take them out if they are in there.  My son is very active, so maybe that\'s contributing to why he doesn\'t really use the bowl...",3
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,I purchased this item for my son and its going to be returned the star fish he cant hold on to the fish the only thing he can hold on to was the crab and he liked that because it crinkled.. This is not Our favorite Lamaze toy and it will be going back to the store..,3
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"My one-year-old baby loves this toy!  She loves to take the fish in and out, and watch through the transparent sides as she takes them in and out.  She loves to play peek-a-boo through the sides.  She loves to shake/squeeze each fish to hear its noise.  Downside: the fish are easy to misplace, so keeping all four together is a challenge.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy to help stimulate my eight-month-old\'s development. When I got it in the mail, I immediately opened it and gave it to her. She has been playing with it since. Her favorite is the crinkle crab because she can make him make noise. She is fascinated by the others. She very quickly learned how to take them out and put them back into the bowl. She has had no difficulty in doing that. Great item, worth the money!! And it is so fun to watch!!",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"Everyone knows nap time can be difficult, my daughter fights it everyday, sometimes she\'ll even jump around and hit the sides of her crib. We decided putting some of those cribside toys made of hard plastic was unrealistic at this point, however I saw this and got it right away.Although we had tried stuffed animals and other soft toys this works he best. It\'s a lot more interactive compared with just hugging her teddy bear. Everyday she plays with it, it also occupies her in the morning when she first wakes. I walk into her room and there she is holding her fishy. Plus if she rolls on it during the night there\'s no chance of hurting herself. She loves it.Great value! Something a little different.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,This is a very good toy that helps manual dexterity and the ability to recognize figures behind the clear plastic. My baby girl especially loves the crinkle crab and the clam !,5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!,5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She\'d chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It\'s worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"We received this as a present for our 6 month old.  I don\'t really think she\'s old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them!  I\'ve noticed that she likes &quot;crinkly&quot; toys, so she loves the crab.  So far, it has kept her very entertained.  I really like Lamaze products so far",4
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy for my baby and for friends\' babies as well. The babies really love the faces on the toys and get a kick out of the different sounds each one makes. They enjoy looking at them through the clear plastic and taking them out and putting them back in over and over. Most kids seem fascinated by ocean creatures anyway, so I think it\'s bound to be a guaranteed &quot;hit&quot; for any child. My 2 1/2 year old still loves to play with the crab!",4
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",2
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 6mos.  He LOVED it!  What great little teethers each of the sea creatures make.  However, 1.5mos down the road, he totally ignored it.  It was beyond his developmental path.  Cute toy, but I\'m not sure it\'s worth it.",3
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We chose this tractor and trailer for a family gift for our two-year-old son and he loves it!  Visiting friends love it, too.  We looked at several others, but this one seemed to be the safest and most durable.  He cannot pedal the tractor yet, but loves to push it around or be pushed while sitting on it and will soon grow to it (he is tall).  The trailer is a great addition and our son loves to fill it with toys (or his little brother!).  The only negative is that the ""hitch"" for the trailer does not lock in place and can be turned causing the trailer to come off at bad times, but we would still recommend it.  The assembly was easy and our little farmer has been thrilled!",5
Pedal Farm Tractor,I bought this for my son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 8 and handed it down to my younger son when he turned 2.  After 5 years of rough and tough riding it is just now starting to break down.  This has been an awesome toy.  We also purchased the trailer and the boys have loved them both.  I think it would have lasted even longer if my 8 year old would have stayed off of it after he had outgrown it.  Anyway the only thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no brake so be careful on hills.,5
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor to accompany the trailer.  Our grandsons are big into farm stuff and love to load up the trailer and pretend they are working ""on the farm.""  It is best for those old enough to reach the pedals (age 3 and up?).  It is very sturdy and durable.  Great toy for those busy toddlers and preschoolers.  Worth every penny it cost!",5
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time....",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We bought these for our son when he turned two. He had seen them at a playmate\'s home and LOVED them. I liked them b/c unlike some of the other cars for sale...there is some learning value and they are VERY durable. They have been thrown, rolled, stepped on, etc and still show no signs of wear. Highly recommend!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son loves stacking cups, so a friend recommended this toy to me.  My son loves it and he enjoys pushing them around the floor.  They nest nicely into each other, which makes it a great toy for the diaper bag.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son Cameron just loves these great little stacking cars!  He enjoys stacking them and slapping them down and each has great little things that they do such as his fire truck has a ladder that clicks up and down, police car has a spinning &quot;light&quot; bar, and so on.  I think it\'s great, brightly colored and has great little faces....I would give this as a gift in the future, not a wasted toy, Oh the little wheels roll, too!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My one year old son received these as a birthday gift. He loves them. Not only are they stackable, which helps with hand-eye coordination, but each car has individual moveable features. Although these features are small, they got his attention. The bright colors are nice also. They are a great buy for the price!  I highly recommend them as first trucks for a small child.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,I purchased this toy for my great grandson\'s first Christmas. He will be 6 months old. I can\'t wait to play with it with him. This is the first baby in our family for 18 years and all the family is waiting for the fun... I will be ordering a lot more soon. Thank you for the convenient shopping. AJ\'S Gee-Gee (Great Grandmom),5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I\'ve owned this set for several years.  My 4 granddaughters love to play with the cars.  Stacking, nesting, playing with the few moving parts.  It is one of their favorite toys when they come over.  And it is definitely one of mine - Lots of play value that stores very well.  They have learned colors, and numbers with these also.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We\'ve traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don\'t take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them.  One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn\'t even break! All parents should get these for your baby.  This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 14 month old son loves to stack and play with these little cars.  They are durable and easy to clean.  I throw them in  the diswasher and they hold up great.  They are well worth the money to me.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Great toys, we always pack one or two in the diaper bag, our 7 month old loves to play with them and I don\'t worry at all about him chewing on these toys as there are only smooth surfaces",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don\'t do much, but they are cute.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old, and he loves them (and so does his 5-year old brother). They both stack the cars, hide them and ""vrroomm"" them. It is great to find a toy that doesn\'t need batteries or require an engineering degree to put together!Highly recommended.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren\'t too big- a perfect size!,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift.  He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can!  It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought the cars because they were easy to store, plus they were cars.  What I have found is that I can actually use then in many places since there is more than one vehicle.  Mostly they are easy to pack for a trip.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son loves this stacking toy. It is much more fun than the stackable rings toy even though he does have that one too. All the boys at our baby group have it and the babies who don\'t always come up to see what it is all about! You can\'t go wrong with this purchase.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn\'t been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn\'t stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn\'t really used them for the intended purpose.  I don\'t think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn\'t take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.  They are extremely durable.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Okay, well they don\'t really beep.  (But my 11-month old son loves when we roll these along and SAY &quot;beep beep!&quot;)  At this point, my son\'s favorite aspect of these cars is the little sunroof, siren and ladder on the tops.  He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They\'re in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don\'t take up too much space when they\'re put away.  I also like that he can grow into them once he understands the nesting/stacking part better.  A great toy...gets played with each and every day!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it\'s the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.,4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck\'s ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son\'s favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My mother-in-law bought 2 of these for our twin boys-- one for each crib-- and they have been a life saver in getting our boys to settle down at night and go to sleep. Now our boys do not sleep without it! Anytime we are going somewhere overnight, we take at least one with us. It is also the only toy that plays music by itself for more than 30 sec. It will play for about 10 minutes!! It\'s our standard gift for all of our parent friends.",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My daughter had this in her crib until she was 2 and loved it.  When she got old enough she loved to turn it on and off by herself.  I used this every night for her to go to sleep by. I used the place that you store the remote control in for extra pacifiers, so if she lost one during the night she would know where to find one.  I never used the remote, but loved the idea another had about putting in the car for rear facing infants when they get fussy you could just turn it on with the remote.  It\'s not too bright and the volume is adjustable.  Someone had said it eat batteries quickly,but I found that they lasted a very LONG time and I used it EVERY night. I highly recommend this product!!",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,I bought this product when my son was about 10 months old.  He was still having problems going to sleep at night and naptime.  The Slumbertime Soother is great.  I sing along with the songs.  My son turns it on himself and sometimes just plays with it.  The nature sounds relax him.  I really like the fact that it plays for ten minutes without stopping.,5
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"I bought this toy for an addition to my son\'s exerciser. However, it would not stick (to anything)!! I tried everything to make it stick. It was very frustrating.",1
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"i bought this beautie at k mart for 5 bucks. other that the suction cup not really working out well, my 3 month old loves it. hell, my husband and i also enjoy playing with it. it has a variey of colours and shapes that help stimulate the mind. you cant lose.",4
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"I bought this to use on the high chair, but within 2 days my son had the rattle part off the base. Needless to say it never went back on for more than 5 min. BUT he did enjoy it in the car and other places.",3
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son loved this toy.  He enjoyed playing with it in his highchair until he was 10 months old.  At that point he was strong enough to pull the toy from its\' base.  He pulled it so hard, he smashed himself in the face with it.  After that upsetting experience, we didn\'t put it in the base anymore.  He did still play with it as a rattle, but it did not hold his attention as well.  I would like to see this toy redesigned so that it cannot be separated from its\' base.",3
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son is nearly a year old and received this toy about 9 months ago.  We both love Sassy toys.  This one is bright and amusing.  Stick it on a car window, high chair tray, restaurant table, bathroom tile,...  We were disappointed in the life of the suction cup, but for all other reasons--color, amusement, education, and co-ordination--get one of these!",5
Sassy Smiley Face Rattle,"This toy is very cute, it has two handles for little hands to grasp, a mirror on one side and on the other the smiley face! the face has wiggly eyes and a nose to beep. but the nose can be frusterating for babies as my 18month old son still has a hard time beeping it! my all in all a cute,durable toy!!",5
Sassy Circle Rattle,My son (who is now 2+ yrs) loved this rattle as a baby.  He loved it so much that I have given it to all of my mommy- friends as a gift.  This is the best toy to have for a young baby.  You will get them to smile for those all-important-photos with this one!!,5
Sassy Circle Rattle,"Both of my sons love this toy. My two year old played with it when he was a baby, and it found its way to the bottom of his toy box at Granny\'s. We found it about a month ago and his 5 month old baby brother began to play with it. Suprise Suprise he loves it too! And his big brother tries to steal it away. This toy is durable, and fun. What more could mom ask for??",5
Sassy Circle Rattle,"What I don\'t love about this is that the clear part, where the baby can watch the beads move with motion, contains BPA.  However, my daughter found this rattle a comfort to her while teething and chewed only the big protruding ball, which as far as I know is free from both PVC and BPA.  I thought she would like the textures of the rings, but nope, it was all about the ball.Also appreciated the bright colors.  This is a good bang for your buck baby toy -- for a while there we always had it in the diaper bag when we left the house.Best at about 6-12 months.  Can\'t see it getting a lot of use before 3 months and just not interesting to a toddler, even a toddler who is still teething.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I was concerned about the chemical content of this ""plastic"" book since a baby will undoubtedly stick it in his mouth. I emailed Sassy and got a reply saying that this was BPA, PVC and Phtalates free. I can breathe a sigh of relief when I hand this to our baby...soon!",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"We bought this for our 5 month old and put pictures of relatives that live far away inside the pages.  The book is very sturdy, &quot;chewable&quot; and has a lot of great colors/designs to look at.  Now at 8 months, this book is still one her favorites!  Plus she sees her grandma\'s and grandpa\'s, etc, faces every day.  We love it.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,I bought this for a new granddaughter.  I will not get to see her often as she lives in another state.  This book is great for out pictures and she can carry it around and look at the pictures as she would a book.  This way she can recognize us when we show up.  It is easy to carry and cleaning it is simple.  It is a great little photo book.,5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I originally bought this for my 4 month old son, but my 17 month old daughter has taken it over.  We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all).  She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people.  The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable. The slots are sized for 3x5 inch pictures.  My 4 month old hasn\'t gotten much out of it yet, but I\'m sure he\'ll love it just as much in months to come.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,This is a nice photo book for babies as it has clear plastic sleeves to protect the pictures you place inside.,5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"Based on articles on the dangers of PVC plastic books, this book was tested and found to contain chemicals that are highly toxic for babies and toddlers. This materials have already been banned from children\'s toys in Europe.In order to read the many articles online that specifically name this book as having been found to contain chemicals that are dangerously toxic for children, google ""toxic bath books"" or the title of the book with the word ""toxic.""This book\'s concept is wonderful, but those who love children should share photos in another kind of album or book.",1
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He\'s a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he\'s fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",5
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"This little toy is safe for infants, and offers great color, texture and even sound.  Very Sweet, though a little pricey.",5

"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",This is exactly like the one I had when I was a kid. My son really enjoys it and it keeps him entertained.,5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it\'s an item that he can grow into and it\'s super cute!",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My daughter enjoys taking it apart more than putting it back together, but a great product.  It has kept her occupied while flying.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Got this for a plane ride 3 months ago. The snaps are hard to snap and he gets frustrated. Most pieces are attached to the book which is nice, he can\'t lose them. He flips thru it but that is about it. Maybe when we travel again he will find it more interesting. We keep it for trips only so it will be ""new"" each time. He has seen it up on the shelf and asks for it but when we give it to him he is done flipping thru in a few minutes and it is left on the floor for other books.",4
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",I bought this for my grandbaby for Christmas. She loves it and my daughter kept saying it was such a neat toy.,5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",My 8 month toddler enjoys this book. Very good idea with mind-stimulating activities on each page. Well worth it for the price.,5

"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My 2 yr+ old grand daughter liked this book a lot.  She did have a hard time with some the buttons or snaps.  They were sewn pretty tight to the backing and was kind of hard to get her fingers under to be able to button or snap.  Overall, she did enjoy each activity.",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I\'m not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I\'m not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid.  The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy.",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"Both of my boys liked playing with this book.  They also liked to take the bear out and play with him.  The pajamas are a little hard to put on, but they didn\'t seem to care much.  My youngest actually has slept with the little bear!",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This book is very cute, and despite other comments I found it to be well made. My son is not real interested though but maybe he will later on. I just think that it doesn\'t have enough pages and interactivity for the price you are paying.",3
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This is a cute, interactive book made out of fabric. It walks you though the night routine (1. Drink your milk, 2. Brush your teeth, 3. Take off your clothes, 4. take a bath, 5. Put on pajamas, 6. Bedtime story, 7. Say a prayer, 8. Lullaby and goodnight) - works well for praying people - unfortunately, I bought it for an agnostic family!",3
Baby Monitor - Direct Link Privacy Monitor,"Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn\'t transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make.  Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it\'s at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor.  However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me.  So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable.",3
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","This is a perfect baby gift:  washable, no parts on which to choke, snuggly, VERY durable and best of all you can give the same gift to all children in the family, by just monogramming an ear.",5
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","My 3 year old son goes EVERYWHERE with Blue Bunny. This is his 6th one since he was born.

He is so soft and cozy. Great friend for small children.",5

Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,"This is an iteresting ball that my baby has loved from about 6 months to 18+ months.  The chime is pleasant, not annoying and this ball is easy for a baby to pick up and manipulate.  It is my understanding that the Sassy line is BPA and Phalate free, so you dont have to worry about your child putting this toy in her mouth.",5
Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,"This toy is a hardier toy than most, I found it is a great toy for my middle sized parrots who love to play with balls with bells in them. So far this toy has lasted almost a year now.",5

Pooh Baby\'s First Tigger,Perfect for young children and overall good quality for the price.,5
Pooh Baby\'s First Tigger,"I actually got the ""Pooh"" one which for some reason is not advertised on babiesrus.com/amazon.I believe that toys like this sometimes are more for the parents as opposed to the babies, but still it is a cute toy!  It went with my newborn son everywhere we went because it fit perfectly with him in his carrier and it was a cute, small toy we could use to interact with.  At 9-months-old he\'s not at that age where he\'s hugging, chewing, just all out playing with his toys and he likes it for that reason.  But babies need more that just stuffed animals.  He\'s obviously much more interested in toys that make sounds or light so his Pooh mostly stays in his room with the other \'dolls\'.This is still a cute item.  I haven\'t had to wash it yet, but it sure is durable.",5
Pedella Wooden Push Toy,"This is a must have for any toddler!  I bought one for my brothers triplets who were 1 1/2 years old at the time.  They loved it!  One would push & the other 2 would chase after it.  They love watching the duck waddle & its feet go round & round.  Best of all, no batteries!  Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.  With heavy playing by 2 children it never lost any of its paint or parts.  It\'s something we are saving for grandchildren one day.",5
Infant Stim-mobile,"Love this mobile!  It is challenging and their eyes are drawn to it.  My son couldn\'t look at it until he got older as he didn\'t like high contrast, but at @ 7 mo he got into it.  If you are a parent who appreciates observing the small nuances of learning that occur in the development process--you will be able to witness it with this toy.  I\'m not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one.",5
Infant Stim-mobile,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby\'s life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don\'t want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it\'s not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can\'t keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don\'t want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more \'traditional\' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that\'s how I\'m using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it\'s really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The \'detailed\' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it\'s an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.",4
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,I\'m really disappointed with this toy.  It never kept my daughter\'s attention.,1
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,"Cute toy, durable and is simple. Nothing sings, light up or dances...just what our kids truly need. Everything talks, spins, lights up....it is hard to find SIMPLE stimulation toys that kids have to manipulate themselves. This set challenges kids mentally as they try to figure out a. how to roll a ball b. how to aim the ball c. how to knock the pins down d. how to pick up the wobbly little guys. also you can tell your child \'aim for the red guy\' or \'aim for the yellow guy\'. great for teaching basic colors and counting too. don\'t forget you can always say WOW you knocked ONE over...and so forth. great all around and gets tossed around too so clearly after using for a month and being bashed on teh floor by little hands trying to figure out how to bounce the not bouncy ball (exploration) nothing has broken.",5
Rattlesnake Squirt,"Not that==> I &lt;==would -- ever -- do it, or recommend it, but there is a gag called theRattlesnake Eggsprank.It is nothing more than a simple mechanism hidden in an envelope that says:""WARNING: RATTLESNAKE EGGS. KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT TO AVOID HATCHING!""I can just picture someone putting a few of these prank envelopes in the backseat of""somebody\'s"" car next to one of these snakes. The first slight bump -- while driving --will produce a r=a=t=t=l=i=n=g sound which should MORE than just shake someone upwhen they look behind them and noticethe SNAKE!What an excellent, cruel, gag. Not for your parents---or grand parents---for OBVIOUS reasons!",5
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it.",5
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It\'s very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it\'s all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)",4
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour!  She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"all three of my kids have had one of these teethers, and it\'s been the favorite for all of them. i buy one for any expectant friend or family member. in our experience, the batteries last about a year & 1/2.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I\'ve tried this for almost 6 months at different points of our kid teething and she\'s just not that into this. It\'s really heavy for a baby. When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I\'m not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It\'s also only wire clean, so it\'s a more high maintenance toy.",2
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This teether is ridiculous. It\'s huge, it\'s hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It\'s just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,One of my friends recommended this for me for my daughter when she was teething. It was the only thing that made her stop crying when she was teething and I tried everything imaginable. I had to hold it to make it vibrate because her mouth wasn\'t strong enough but it made her so happy and cuddly that is far from a complaint. Have recommended it to lots of my friends and they all love it.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Great teether as it has a good texture, is easy to handle and massages the gums while baby is chewing on it.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I ordered this product after reading many of the other reviews, and I\'m also pleased with this purchase. My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we\'d tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn\'t terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I\'d hoped.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My four month old started teething around two months, he has pretty impressive motor skills when it comes to using his hands but this teether is huge and you really have to apply quite a bit of pressure for it to vibrate. My other son who is two and also teething shows absolutely no intrest in this at all. Maybe in a couple more months....",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,It is a good teether for my handicapped student. But the ability to bit down is required which is hard for my student.,4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My daughter is two months and loves this in her mouth.  She seem to like the points and the softer rubber than theInfantino Vibrating Strawberry Teether.  Also it requires less pressure to make vibrate.  No she is not teething yet and no she cannot make it vibrate yet.  But if you pinch it for her, their are three different point surfaces and yes she has her favorite.  If she is getting a bit cranky, there are times this will turn her back into all smiles.  At this point, she seems to ""chew"" and vigorously suck on the points.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This is a good idea but it takes a lot of pressure for my 7 month old granddaughter to make it vibrate.  I can squeeze one corner to make it vibrate while she chews on the other end.  Otherwise she chews it like a regular teething you.,3
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The older one of these lasted us several years for my special needs daughter who likes the vibration. This one lasted 3 months before the battery died. Folks, you need to work on battery life or just go back to the old style teether!",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don\'t really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My little guy loves his star teether! It\'s great entertainment for him, and he likes the opposite spinning side too. It was easy to introduce to him, and easy to clean too!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he\'s teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it\'s a smart packaging extra to have the \'free ring\' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don\'t know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I bought this for upcoming teething, and we still don\'t seem to be there, but my baby just thinks this thing is good fun.  She bites on it and the vibration cracks her up.  That\'s enough for me!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My LO is definitely teething and I\'ve tried giving this to her but she can never get the massager to go at it on her own.  I will have to put it in her mouth and press it at the same time.  She looks at me and I imagine her thinking &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and she pulls her face away.  I\'m hoping she\'ll want to use it again before her teeth actually come in since I can\'t return it at this point.  We\'re sticking to the fake keys and her little Sophie the Giraffe for now.,2
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn\'t have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I\'ve bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I know it\'s a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he\'s does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn\'t seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can\'t always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It\'s not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I\'m holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn\'t vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This thing is big. Baby can grow into it. It really does help when I hold it and turn it on for him. If he isn\'t done with it he is sure to let me know. Which to me translates that he likes it. I\'m not sure how I feel about the sticky feeling plastic, seems unnecessary and everything sticks to it.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had bought a similar toy like this in the 90\'s for my daughter when she was teething and now she has children. I bought one for my grandson, then more recently this one for my granddaughter. Babies love the sensation it gives them when their front teeth are coming out and making them miserable. I believe it relieves them of some of their pain and I highly recommend any parent with teething babies to get this toy for them! It is a sturdy product and you don\'t have to worry about any little parts coming loose or damaged. My babies and grandkids abused theirs and it still took the beating.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don\'t know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It\'s a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This is great, my son loves it and it\'s pretty easy for him to hold he enjoys the vibrations when he chews on it.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,A favorite in our house!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn\'t the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I\'m sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I\'m still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.",2
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he\'s just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn\'t very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son\'s sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby\'s eye. Overall, it\'s an OK toy for the price.",3
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"This teething ring is great!  We probably have enough toys to have our own toy store, including at least 2-3 of these teething rings! Our 10-mth-old baby loves to stick one of them in his mouth (like just one bead of it) and walk or crawl around with his hands free to hold other toys.  Our 7-mth-old, loves it too, with his favorite game being to simply have one of us sit it on his head and then wait for it to fall off when he moves.  He thinks it is hestarical.  It\'s amazing how much fun they can have with such a simple toy.",5
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.,5
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My baby loves to play with this during bath time! It\'s easy for her to hold, bite and play with!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I thought this would be an excellent item to have. I was wrong! This is the most cumbersome thing I own and my son sweats like crazy in it. There\'s no support for the baby\'s neck or back, and I always feel like he\'s about to fall out of it. Unless you\'ve got really strong shoulders or a feather-weight infant, you might want to skip the infant carrier thing completely. Save yourself time and money on this - I wouldn\'t buy it again!!",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"It is a little awkward at first, but I had an extremely premature baby who was too small for the traditional carriers, and needed to be held all the time.  I lived, cooked, did laundry, ate, and slept with this sling for 2 months.  Once my baby was bigger and needed to be held less I started using other carriers.  But now I\'m back to the sling because quite frankly, once you get the hang of it, its much, much easier to get baby in and out of it.",4
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn\'t liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn\'t give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5\'5&quot; inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you.  My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby &amp; I got tired of using this.,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one.  We both hated it. Maybe because I\'m 5\'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It\'s not one size fits all. If you\'re short, think twice on this.",2
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic\'s having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you\'ll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren\'t good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don\'t pack up and so aren\'t with you when you need them.)",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,My Grandson is super fussy and I used this for my own son. Put my Grandson in this turned on the vacuum and he was out like a light! He looked just like he was back in the womb!Thank goodness I still had this as it is no longer available. What a great product!,5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried.  People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling.  All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears\'s The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what\'s going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I\'ve been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby\'s head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won\'t pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren\'t careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she\'s a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it\'s the blue and the fact that they can\'t see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we\'re going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you\'ll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren\'t supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It\'s good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you\'re with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She\'s also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that\'s great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It\'s nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I love Dr. Sear\'s books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5\'5"" woman.  My 6\'5"" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn\'t believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn\'t tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!",2
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this.",3
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn\'t able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she\'s having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she\'s very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don\'t even feel the weight of the baby when he\'s in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don\'t develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn\'t get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn\'t seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone\'s advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I\'m petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that\'s not bulky and comes in sizes - I don\'t get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I\'d need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling\'s fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom\'s arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he\'ll fall asleep while I\'m driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can\'t promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears\' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don\'t try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It\'s portable and comes in different sizes.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,I disagree with all of the reviews that say one size does not fit all. My Husbad is 6&quot;4 I am small frame 5&quot;2 and all we had to do when switching was move the adjustment. It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.,5
"Arm\'s Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Solid Toffee","I love the idea of the co-sleeper. I\'ve seen some other concept designs by other companies and I hope they follow through with them. Arm\'s Reach has a bit of a monopoly on the co-sleepers right now. My little one hasn\'t arrived yet, so I haven\'t actually used it yet. Assembly is REALLY confusing. I don\'t know what happened to my paper instructions, but I can\'t find them. Luckily, there are some on the AR web page. But it is still so confusing.For those of us who are ardent Attachment Parenting, this is ideal. My older son, 15 months old, is still in bed with us and this Arm\'s Reach will give us the extra space for two little ones. We used the Snuggle Nest when our older boy was a small infant and that worked great. With two though, I wanted to keep the older away from the younger while they slept but still near us.If attachment parenting is a new concept for you, I strongly encourage you to read as much as you can online. Arm\'s Reach co-sleeper is a great way to co-sleep without the fear of suffocation.",4

Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This is a horrible product - because the base of the bar is round, it doesn\'t attach properly to a stroller, and it keeps sliding forward or back, thus losing all the snacks in the cup.  They need to redesign it with a flat base.  There is one company that has one with the flat base - it\'s made by Kids11, Inc -and my daughter LOVES IT!  Don\'t waste your money on this one - you, and your little one will just be frustrated!",1
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This toy was a waste of my money.  It did not fit on my stroller without some modification and even then, it didn\'t stay put.  It would not stay upright when my daughter played with it.  And it had a removable piece in it.  Needless to say, it was not a piece my daughter at the time knew how to put in and out.  And on top of that, she decided that she\'d rather play with the removable plastic piece than the toy itself!  Also, my stroller would not fold up with this on (oh yea, my stroller is a name brand stroller too).  I would have to remove it everytime i folded it up.  Needless to say, I did that about twice and then tossed the toy in the trash.",1

I had no idea the ladybug on it was a snack holder, I wouldn\'t be putting anything in there, The stroller I have the Tray comes off so I just put the toy on it without the tray. but it the straps do loosen up on it, so I am every once in awhile Straightening it.I do reccomend the toy to anyone who has a baby like my daughter! i\'m very happy with the toy!",5

I give this product 3 stars because my son did like to play with it but, thats really the only good thing.",3
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"I bought this on a whim to keep my 4 month old happy in his stroller.  Otherwise, I would be holding him while pushing the stroller!  Well - he is now 9 1/2 months old and STILL loves it!  He bites on the wings of the bee and chews on the bug attached with fabric.  He doesn\'t ever seem to tire of this toy and I\'ve been on marathon shopping sessions with him lasting a few hours!!  I would recommend this to everyone as one of the must haves for under 12 months!",5
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months. He is now 11 months and is not that enthused with it anymore. I liked this product because of the bright colors and the variety for him to play with. It is a very good toy, but my son doesn\'t have much interest in it. Nothing at all wrong with the toy, I would recommend it to anyone.",4
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,This toy is very cute and I personally love Sassy products but I found this to be a hazard as well as a waste.  First of all the butterfly hits my children in the face and has hurt their mouth as well not to mention it does not fit properly on a stroller.,1
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This toy is so nice to have if you use your stroller a lot. My baby has loved playing with this and I have even given this as a gift. The only thing that I did not like was that the cup that is the bugs legs, comes out. That is great for cleaning but if the baby takes it out, it can become yet another thing to keep track of during your ever so busy outings. Overall, this is a great and cute idea and gives some added fun for babies stroller time.",4
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"We have this stroller bar and it ABSOLUTELY fits on the Graco strollers!  We have the Graco Quattro Tour system and this toy bar has been on it since we took my son out of the car seat carrier.  You need to put the velcro on off to the side and then slide it on to the main section of the snack tray.  It takes maybe 1-2 minutes to attach and then you never need to touch it again.  My son loved to look at it when he was 4 months and loves to play with it now that he is one year old.  The only complaint that I have about this toy is that the snack cup bug comes with an insert that is supposed to look like legs when the cup is closed.  It tends to fall out so i just took it off the toy.  Other than that, this is a great product and will occupy your child during long stroller trips.",5
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.,3
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"Once my daughter started teething, the paint started coming off &amp; it was only when we found some on her lip that we realized.  We have not used it since &amp; had only been using the bar for a couple of months.I worry about such things as \'paint eating\' &amp; consider the possible risks to be too concerning to rate this product any higher than 1*.Best wishes.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Ok - newsflash.  Diapers are just smelly.  We\'ve had this pail for 2.5 years now.  It was our first and primary one.  There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn\'t find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn\'t notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that\'s pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I\'ve knocked off a star since the mechanism isn\'t that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.  Plus there are some smell issues, as with any pail.  However, the fact that you can use regular trash bags is so much more convenient!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a good product to start and very easy to use.  But as baby gets older and begins solid foods, it is not effective as an odor controlling pail.  It is simply a place to put dirty diapers.  My daughter is now 10 months old and we had to remove the Diaper Champ from her nursery because it smells too bad.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn\'t seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it\'s just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I\'m talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We\'re going to try another disposal system.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love our diaper champ.  It is very easy to use just drop the diaper in and flip the top over.  No need to stick your hand inside.  No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.  When it gets full, just put in a new trash bags.  The best feature of all is that even the most curious little ones can\'t get into the diapers.  Before we found the diaper champ, we had another diaper pail and our son learned to open it and pull the diapers out.  That is no longer a problem!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.  They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child\'s point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it\'s flip top access lid locks into place and doesn\'t plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it\'s neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it\'s clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.  Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that\'s better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby\'s poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it\'s not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it\'s very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had a diaper genie for almost 4 years since my first son was born and I have been using it with my second as well.  I thought I\'d try the champ to save $ on the genie refills.  Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags.  The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.  The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.  I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child\'s room-they wouldn\'t be able to get into it!  Don\'t waste your $ to ""save"" $!  Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!!  Also, if you don\'t keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it! YUCK!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn\'t like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed \'diaper odor.\'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son\'s diaper have been amazed at how the very \'potent\' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn\'t as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that\'s it.  The Champ is definitely the best.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We had 2 diaper Genie\'s both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).  Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.  On top of that the refills are very expensive.  So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.  It is very easy to use with one hand.  I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.  Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I\'d heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I\'ve had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I\'m looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I\'d drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that\'s when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter\'s nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won\'t be returning for a come-back fight.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the very best. So much better than Diaper Genie. No doubt about it. I would never buy Diaper Genie again. As a matter of fact I threw them out. Here you have No Refills to buy, much easier to empty and put in a new garbage bag, a lot cheaper and most of all a lot quieter. The Diaper Genie is so loud when putting in a diaper in the middle of the night that is a pain. I highly recommend this product. In regards to smell?.....excuse me there are diapers in there, not roses. Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go. If you\'re still picky put in an airfreshner.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this pail because it used regular trash bags and hoped it lived up to all it says - IT DOES!!  We use the scented trash bags and have had no trouble at all!  (It does get a little smelly when you change the bag, but that is expected)The only thing we don\'t like is the inside lid that holds the bag down. It does not stay up on its own.  So when you change bags it has to be held open with 1 hand-leaving only 1 hand to get the bag out.  It just makes it akward.My husband even recommends it!!  So it has to be good.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"While pregnant with my son I reviewed all the diaper pails and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable.  I liked the idea of no costly refills and it was only a couple more dollars than the diaper genie.  It was easy to put together, however it is difficult to open and empty.  My son is now 13 months old and the odor is noticeable.  Even the pail itself stinks regardless of how often I scrub it ( I even use scented trash bags).  With dirty diapers you do have to expect some smell, I mean it comes with the territory, however I have to keep an air freshner plugged into the wall to help combat the smell. It worked well for the first few months, but now I end up having to change the bags before they are even half full, which really seems like a waste.  I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have not used this item yet for diapers, but as for my first inspection upon receiving this as a gift...I found that every time I moved the handle at the top, the unit wobbled due to the poor design- large at the top with a small base.  I noticed that some online stores sell a new and improved design that has a larger base at the bottom- I purchased the newer model and no longer have the wobble problem.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie? That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born. Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me. She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that\'s what I went with. The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me. Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT! The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags. I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too. it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it. The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it). I am glad for this, though, because if it\'s not easy for me to open, it won\'t be for my son, either.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!) and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it. The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again! (They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Although I had a Diaper Genie from my first child, which I hated, I registered for this for my second.  I received very few items from my registry but this was by far the best gift I received overall. It is very easy to operate.  My 4 year old feels a part of the diaper changes because he can work it.  It keeps the smell out which makes mom and dad happy.  But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don\'t have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.  It is definately a people pleaser!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Granted our 3-month old isn\'t producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.  My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We loved this pail at first. The mechanism seemed ingenius, and we appreciated that it took regular bags. But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it. That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you\'ll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers. Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way. It\'s really pretty scary.You\'ll notice that the positive reviews here generally say ""I\'ve been using this for two months, and it\'s great!"" But once you have older babies, I\'d retire it pronto.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought this for my church nursery room. At home we use the First years product, which isn\'t bad but not as good as this one.There are a couple of occasions that dirty diapers were left in it for a week but i didn\'t know because it didn\'t smell till I opened it to change the garbage bag.I think this is the only diaper pail that is cheap to use yet does the job well.Highly recommend.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I recently gave birth to my third child.  When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.  Not to mention that the ""sausage links"" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.  With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.  I LOVE IT!  In fact, I am considering buying one for my church\'s nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.  I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.  So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it\'s still a great product.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Our daughter is 13 months old and we\'ve been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it\'s a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won\'t drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn\'t seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it\'s empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn\'t completely trapped, but it\'s pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband & I had received a tip from another parent that this was the must have item.  I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that.  That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it.  It is a complete life saver all around.  No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.  Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.  A little tip to keep the odor down.  I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.  Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.  Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.  It is a sure winner.  You\'ll save a lot of money by using this one.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I don\'t know how we survived the first year without the Diaper Champ.  My daughter is now 13 1/2 months old and we still have an odor free nursery.  It\'s very economical, too.  Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it\'s going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.  I don\'t know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!  And if I don\'t change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!  Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can\'t be beat.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.  All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!  My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn\'t believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I didn\'t want to get the Diaper Genie because of the expensive refills needed to use the product.  The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).  The mechanism doesn\'t let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can\'t get into the Diaper Champ!  Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it\'s simple to open.  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I wasn\'t sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie. I am so glad that I chose this one. I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice. It really holds in the horrible diaper smell. I love it and wouldn\'t trade it in for anything.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.  (The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I\'ve had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I\'ve had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn\'t open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one\'s excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven\'t seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bad construction is my main issue. My husband assembled it and when changing the bag, you\'re supposed to open up the top head part which tilts back.  There\'s a little plastic tab that\'s suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get\'s cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I\'ve given up on diaper pails in general.  Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time. I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty. Very simple to put the diapers in. We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb. Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore! Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day. It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else. There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is on my list of must haves.  The thing has been in my bedroom for 6 months.  Not once have I ever smelled an odor from this thing.  I love that I can use any kind of bag so I just buy those super cheap super flimsy tall size garbage bags.The only drawback, as with all diaper pails, is that as the baby gets bigger and the diapers get bigger, you have to change the bag more often.  Our baby is 6 months and we fill it about once every 36 hours.But still, I wouldn\'t trade it for the world.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper catches and jams in the well and that is particularly nasty when the diaper is dirty.  Also, it is impossible to get it 100% clean after such a jam, which causes the oder to persist.  I have given up and am now throwing my Diaper Champ away and getting something new.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags.  I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great.  There is no diaper odor in our nursery.  When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn\'t flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it\'s overflowing!).If you don\'t clean things, they don\'t smell clean.  This isn\'t rocket science.The only reason I\'m not giving it five stars is because I don\'t like the opening mechanism on the front.  But I can\'t think of any way they could\'ve done it differently that would be as effective.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve been using this diaper pail for 2 and 1/2 years and I LOVE it.  I can buy inexpensive scented bags from the grocery store and I just use recycled grocery bags to wrap-up the poopie ones.  My son\'s room has NEVER smelled at all!I do lysol it every once in a while.  But that\'s all I\'ve had to do.When I\'m at friends\' houses that have the diaper genie, I\'ve been confused about how to use it.  No one has ever been confused about how to use ours.  Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It suprises me to read all of these reviews saying that the diaper pail stinks up a room!  DUH! It\'s full of dirty diapers.  Personally, we never had that problem too much.  The nursery smells a bit sometimes but I think you would have that with every diaper pail.We got this one because we use cloth diapers and don\'t want each one mummified in it\'s own cocoon.  I used this for my first two kids.  We threw it out when we moved but now that the third is here we are going to get a new Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I\'ve been breastfeeding and the poop doesn\'t stink as much as formula poop.  So I can\'t tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it\'s excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It\'s very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You really can not appreciate this device until you\'ve used it.No smell unless you don\'t empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it\'s not....but it does what it\'s designed to do very well.Who doesn\'t take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who\'s thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am glad my friend told me about the diaper champ, because otherwise I would have gone in for the diaper genie. This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor. It is also bigger than the genie, and the best part is, you can use regular garbage bags in them. Isn\'t that just PERFECT? Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"In reading some of the other reviews, I think it\'s all been said but I guess I\'ll say it again anyway.  :)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.  My husband and I tend to let it get to the point that we have to actually push the plunger down to get the diaper to go in and still the nursery is odor-free for playing or sleeping.  And I must admit, I have a 1 yr. old who eats everything under the sun and even when it comes time to change the bag, it\'s not that bad.  Tie it up fast and you\'re good to go. ;)  I will admit that it can be hard to open, but if it were easier, I\'d have dirty diapers strung from one end of the room to the other because of my busy boy!!!  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I Loved this product. It kept smell to a minimum and could use a regular size trash bag.  Highly  recommend.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After 2 and half years I still can\'t get the smell out. Its been sitting outside airing out for 3 months now, I think thats where I\'m leaving it too. I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product meets all my expectations. The diaper champ is easy to put together. It keeps odors in the container. Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags! By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up.  Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the worst diaper pail ever!  It was great for the first couple weeks, but then it began to smell.  I cleaned the inside and outside with 409 again and again, but the smell would return with the first diaper I put in.  Then to make matters worse my 16 month old figured out it was fun to put toys in the hole where you put the diapers and try to flip it the way I did with his dirty diapers.  I had a Diaper Genie that broke and was hopeful that this less complicated diaper disposal system would work as well, but it does not!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers.  My cat box smells fresher!  So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys!  Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too.  The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don\'t have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.  So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door. Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is my first baby so I have nothing to compare this product to. But I have heard horror stories of stinky diaper pails. My baby is now six months old and the only time I smell her diapers is when I change them and when I open the pail to replace the bag! I use the same garbage bags that I use in my 13-gallon kitchen trash can! It\'s so simple and user-friendly it\'s ridiculous! Put in a trash bag, old plastic grocery bag, yard waste bag, whatever; put down the top, you\'re ready to go. The top acts like a chute and whisks the dirty diaper away. When full pop the top (hold your breath), pull out the bag and put in a new one. No jamming or any other kind of technical difficulty whatsoever! And, again, no leaking smells. Don\'t waste your money on anything else!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As new parents, we started out with the Diaper Genie because everyone told us that we just *HAD* to have one.  While the Genie did a decent job at keeping the odors inside (except when emptying it!), it was a pain in the neck for older family members to use (e.g. grandparents) and those refill cartridges start to add up after a while!A friend with a child the same age as mine showed me her Diaper Champ and I was thoroughly impressed!  Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.  We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he\'d be in diapers for at least another year so we\'d be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.  Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!  After all, we\'re already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.  It is super easy to empty it too.  And I\'ve found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!  And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you\'ll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I found this pail to be heavy without anything in it.  I found that it took up too much space.  I find myself using a regular small garbage pail and I don\'t smell any odors (and all of my windows are closed).  dislike the mechanism for opening this pail, when I opened this pail for the first time, I broke two of my nails, I tried opening again and it was still hard on the fingers and nails. My son is only two months and perhaps I need a diaper pail later on, but for right now, I am going to use a regular garbage pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Can\'t get the smell of rank diapers out of the top(cover) of the Diaper Champ. Any better models out there?,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ. It holds a nice amount of diapers,contains the odor and it uses your own garbage bags. The Diaper Champ is easy to use and to empty, it really is a wonderfully designed product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment.  the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder!  my busy toddler can\'t get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).  I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I was told not to waste my money on a diaper pail because it didn\'t do what it claimed to do.  Finding out it was a genie diaper pail I read the reviews of the diaper champ and decided to try the champ.  I couldn\'t have spent my money any wiser. Their is never an odor and I always wait until it is completely full.  Convenience of not buying new bags is wonderful!!  This is great for my 10 week baby\'s room-Love it!!!!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"With my second child I wanted something better than the Diaper Genie which I did not like at all, it was smelly and impossible to do with a one hand action.  Enter the Diaper Champ! After reading all of the customer reviews here I decided to try it and everyone was so right.  I can put poopie diapers in this diaper pail and it doesn\'t smell at all! It holds a sufficient amount of diapers and needs no special bags, just regular garbage bags. I has an easy one hand action to deposit the dirty diapers leaving one hand free to hold the baby with. I am totally pleased with the Diaper Champ and hope everyone gives it a try, its worth the money!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.  That was all I could take.  Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE\'s changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn\'t smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don\'t wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter\'s room doesn\'t smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is amazing! We can toss tons of diapers (abouth 5 days diapers for a new born). And there is NO smell at all. I do recommend the following: Close well each diaper with the velcro, you\'ll be able to fit more diappers. And occasionally clean the tube where the diaper is toss with baby wipes, then toss the wipe. Somehow when you open the diaper champ to replace teh bag, you smell more wipes than stools!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We wanted to have a convenient locking receptable for poop-laden diapers in our toddler\'s bedroom. While they do lock, they aren\'t convenient. Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table. Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They\'re bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You\'d need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change. It will control odors better, and you won\'t have to be continually wiping poop off the outside of it.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wasn\'t interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!  Plus they can get expensive when you\'re having to change your baby 8 times a day and you have to buy refills for it.  When I first saw the Diaper Champ and read what you needed for it and what it did, there was no question that I wanted it!  It\'s awesome!  When they say it\'s odorless, it REALLY is.  The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.  You never smell anything when it\'s closed.  Plus, I like the fact that you don\'t have to buy refill bags for it.  It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.  I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a very convenient and odorless diaper pail!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I checked out all of the available diaper disposal systems.  This by far is the best, no refillable special bags, no stink, and very easy to use.  It is great! Those exploding diapers for newborns can\'t even crack this.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the diaper champ for how many diapers it holds and the fact you don\'t have to buy special bags for it, but it doesn not keep in the odors. I feel like I have to change the bag more often so I don\'t know how much I\'m really saving by not buying the special bags that a diaper genie requires. I spray the pail after every use and have cleaned it out with bleach and it still smells. Great idea but it just doesn\'t work. I haven\'t gone back to the diaper genie yet...is there anything else out there that works?",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was definately excited to have a diaper pail capable of keeping smells down and holding more diapers. I have two little ones under the age of two.  I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up.  I guess mine could be broken but I think its just poor design.  It also seems to be no better than the competitors at keeping diaper smells in the pail.  The plus is that it uses regular trash bags.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I own both the Diaper Champ and the &quot;other one&quot;.  I have had the &quot;other one&quot; for two years now and cannot wait to get my toddler out of diapers so I can get rid if it.  I bought the Diaper Champ for my newborn and have had for 2 months and LOVE IT!  Easy to use, easy to clean, and I use tall kitchen garbage bags so emptying it is a breeze!  I wipe it out with Lysol Wipes everytime I change the bag and spray the openings with Lysol once a day and have zero odor problems.  Hint: I also put a dryer sheet at the bottom of the pail in the bag so it gets tossed every time I change the bag and a fresh one gets put in!  Enjoy this product - Wish I had known about it with my first child!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is absolutely, by far, the best diaper pail money can buy.  Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it\'s getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it\'s kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she\'s two months old now and we still just can\'t say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She\'s eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it\'s job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.  We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it\'s been great so far.  (We\'ll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It\'s so easy to use and you don\'t have to buy the special bags.  We\'ve used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we\'ve have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn\'t even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don\'t no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Thank goodness we found something better and easier than ""genie""!!This one works great, no difficulty loading bags or putting diapers in.Only reason for not 5 stars is a little odor escapes but in my opinion well worth the offsetting ease of use.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.  It is ultra convient when you have your hands full with a dirty diaper and a kicking, squirming wiggle worm.  There has been no smell at all, and the champ\'s generous size allows plenty of diapers, which is important because it seems as though there is no time to do ANYTHING!!!  I would recomend this product to any and all people with babies.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I changed my registry from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews for the Diaper Champ online. I\'m very happy with it. Our baby\'s cradle is in our room so we keep the Champ in there with us. There are no odor problems whatsoever. I also love that you don\'t have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn\'t release very smoothly. When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn\'t taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you\'re trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags. The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well. A MUST have!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"you can use any ol\' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It works ok.  I\'ve had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I\'m going to find something else.  The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven\'t compared it with other bins, so I couldn\'t say whether it\'s the lesser of evils, but hopefully there\'s something better out there for the job.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for 4 weeks now (trust me, newborns poopy diapers DO smell) and it has met all our expectations. No odor and easy to use!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"So far so good.  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.  I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags.  I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget).  I works great.  The only thing is when it is full it is full.  It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.  I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby\'s room and would recommend this item.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Overrated, odor is bad. I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.  If you don\'t want the diaper smell don\'t get this.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve never even had a problem with it.  There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.  The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.  Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.  Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn\'t have a smell.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have purchased three diaper pails prior to this one. This one is a hundred times better. The other ones always had springs that broke or the lid wouldn\'t stay shut. The Diaper Champ has none of these problems, and it is nice to use regular garbage bags. It was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was a great invention. No special bags and easy to use one handed. You just put in regular garbage bags (fits like a glove) and empty as you would your regular garbage. NO smells, NO Mess, NO problem. It\'s a must have!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the only diaper pail we\'ve had and our son is now 2.  We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it\'s olfactory-blunting performance even more.  For especially messy and stinky diapers, I\'ll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it\'s not!  I haven\'t even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol\'d it in 2 years.  Did I really just admit that?!?  We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.  If there\'s ever a smell in the nursery, it\'s from the dipaer\'s presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.  My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we\'ve had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).  Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I\'d recommend it to anyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Works great - no smells.  LOVE that it uses regular garbage bags. Easy to change and keep clean. Great option instead of the Diaper Genie that requires special bags and is so wasteful since it wraps each diaper in plastic.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got the Diaper Champ as a gift and immediately fell in love with it.  I wish I had invented this product.  It is one of our Top 10 items to buy.It takes regular kitchen trash bags and is really quite good about the smell.  Now that we are introducing Isabella to more foods we are finding that it does not contain the smell as well, but better than anything else that we use.The only problem I run into this that it gets stuck on the inside from time to time at the worst possible moment -- stinky full diaper that needs to disappear right now!  I am pregnant again so these smells get to me.  Because of this problem I gave it 4 stars.It gets stuck from an occasional diaper sticky tab sticking to the inside .  When this happens, you have open everything up and it can get a little messy if the tab was stuck in the wrong placeWe also own a Diaper Genie which is 99% smell proof, but also has it\'s own problems.  I would only buy this one, even if money, space and smell were not an issue.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn\'t want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!  I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.  I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I\'ve never had a problem with smell (I\'ve been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it\'s TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I\'d do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I\'d still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can\'t expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a two month old.  I\'ve tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie for two months now.Bottom line:If cost is important to you...get the Diaper ChampIf smell is important to you...get the Diaper GenieThe design of the Diaper Champ does not prevent smell as well as the Diaper Genie PERIOD.If you see a review here that touts that the Diaper Champ doesn\'t smell, then laugh at them.  They probably have a dog and think that it and their house don\'t smell because of the dog either.YES, the Diaper Genie costs more over the life because of their bags.  SO WHAT.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When our daughter was born we bought the diaper genie and it soon became another unused thing in our closet.  I found it so impractical, because no matter what it says it is never truely one hand operable.  And it takes so long to stuff and twist that the baby is neglected on the changing table for a longer period of time.  Also, it didn\'t hold very many diapers and was a pain to unload.  I would rather just walk each diaper outside!  So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that\'s when we found the diaper champ.  I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!  I know she will convert to this one.  I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.  All you do is flip the handle over and you\'re done.  No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!) just let gravity do it\'s thing.  It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.  Plus there are no special bags!  Not only a money saver, but no need to worry about running out.  I just use our kitchen trash bags, and they work great.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap.  Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don\'t have to worry about the &quot;squish&quot; factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time.  Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain.  I still think it was worth it to buy this one!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have used my Diaper Champ for a little over a year.  I was taken in by the fact that I could use grocery bags instead of continually purchasing liner refills.  The Champ worked great for only a small while.  As your children grow, the Champ will be very little help in controlling odor, which is the sole reason I purchased a diaper pail instead of a garbage can.  I change the pail every two days, sometimes every day due to the odors it fails to control.  I have begun to individually wrap up each smelly diaper before putting it into the diaper pail.  Otherwise, my son\'s room would constantly smell.  I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.  Consider the Diaper Dekor or Neat Disposal System instead.  I\'ve read great reviews on both.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Simply put, the Diaper Champ is much easier to use, less expensive, and most importantly, MUCH better at keeping those odors locked away when compared to the Diaper Genie.  Even the smell of my niece\'s ""soy diapers"" don\'t seep through this.  I have been thoroughly impressed -- even the nurses at the hospital where I had my baby recommended it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It\'s simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven\'t had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I agree it\'s better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It\'s very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the diaper champ.  I registered for this item because I liked the fact that it takes regular garbage bags.  When it\'s almost full it tends to have a bit of an odor, but lysol takes care of that, and helps kill germs.  This is very easy to use and is simple to change.  I highly recommend the diaper champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It\'s so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail.  And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one.  While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!!  So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.  Oh well, I\'d still recommend it.  You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well.  And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.  way cheaper than others.  have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading many reviews for several different diaper pails.  This is by far the easiest product to use.  There are no complicated bag systems and no special replacement bags.  I have not had the problem of having any oppressive odors leak out into the room.  The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.  There is no such thing as a completely odorless plastic diaper pail since plastic absorbs odors, but just drop a couple of dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) into the bottom of the diaper champ (not in the bag) and the odor disappears.  This product is easy to use and the bags aren\'t hard to change.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My 8 year old yellow lab was able to get the top of the diaper champ off and get his head stuck in the canistar.  No one was home and he suffocated.  This could just as easily have happend to a small child.  There is no warning in the literature to prevent this type of horrible tragedy .,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I have no problems with my Diaper Champ.  It\'s great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.  Definitely recommend,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are first time parents but have friends who have young children. We always try to get out of spending the night at their house because the diaper pail in the spare bathroom smells so bad. We took a strangers advice (no one we knew believed in a diaper pail that didn\'t stink) and we purchased this product. We couldn\'t be happier. At first we used it for disposable diapers which worked fine, but we were worried about how it was going to hold up when we started using cloth diapers. Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top. We did run in to that once, it means the diaper champ is full and you need to empty it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wasn\'t going to get a diaper disposal system because I knew I did not want a new baby and then worrying about making sure I had the proper garbage bags.  But, I found the Diaper Champ and love it!  It works well and I went to Costco and purchased enough bags to last until the babies in high school for under twenty bucks!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is by far the best diaper disposal system we have found. You don\'t need any special bags - we usually just buy a roll of 35 13-gallon bags from Target for 99 cents. Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don\'t have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ. Your odor problem will be solved.I would recommend this to everyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.  It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).  It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.  As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.  For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.  Now that our son\'s diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.  We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).  It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it\'s only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I did a lot of research before buying a ""diaper system"" (asked friends, read other reviews on amazon, consulted baby product guides, etc.).  There didn\'t seem to be a consensus on the best one out there.  However, I have been very happy with my Diaper Champ purchase - the stink is contained, the dirty diapers drop in easily and it uses regular kitchen bags (no special bags required like other systems).",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The best feature is that you can use your own garbage bags.  This makes the investment in a diaper pail a one-time occurance!!  The Diaper Champ works by using a piston-type chute.  You put the diaper in the chute, flip the handle, and the piston slide the diaper down into the bag below.  Nothing fancy...nothing to break!So far, it has worked great.  We change the bags 1-2 times per week.  Yes, it is stinky when you remove the bag, but what do you expect?!  We did put an sticky deodorant in the pail to help.  I agree with previous reviews...you still have to clean the thing!!When comparing to my sister\'s Diaper Genie, this is much simpler to use and costs much less over its lifetime.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This has been a fantastic diaper pail for us.  We went through a Diaper Genie with each of our first two children, and this third time, I\'m so glad we tried the Diaper Champ.  It has proven to be far better than the Diaper Genies.  Our baby is 7 months old now and eating solids, and the odors have not been a problem.  Not buying special bags has been great.  No twisting; no cutting; no blades to wear out.  Wish we\'d used this with our first two.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As much as I hear you all on the Diaper Champ - it is fabulous - the SMELL factor is greatly reduced when you take the trouble to empty diapers into the lavatory first.  This is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing.  Feces should NOT go into landfills because they can carry bacteria and intestinal viruses which can filter into, and contaminate, groundwater and soils.  Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!  Please be more conscientious!  Do your part and put the poop in the pot and help to preserve our precious planet for that little person whose bottom you are currently managing.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat. The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that. I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery. This is one of the best purchases we made. The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend\'s house REALLY reinforced that!! There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn\'t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I find this product easy to operate.  With any diaper pail you will have odor, but folding the diapers up and using the sticky tabs on the diapers to keep the diaper folded will help keep odor away.  We bought 2, one for near the crib and one for the main floor.  BRILLIANT idea...didn\'t have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.  Another helpful idea...put used diaper wipes in the diaper before folding the diaper up...otherwise the wipe will sometimes get caught in the slider and leave poopies on the pail.  How often did we have to empty it?  -  twice/wk when he was 0-3 months...once a wk after that.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I decided to register for this diaper pail mainly because of the fact that it didn\'t require special bags.  My baby is now almost 6 weeks old and we are really happy with it.  You can use regular kitchen garbage bags and our nursery doesn\'t smell at all.  It\'s very easy to use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant.  It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad.  Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers.  Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn\'t want to spend the money on the refills.  However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie.  What a difference!!  The only time smell escapes is when we empty it.  To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.  If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the &quot;champ&quot;.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,If you dont want the baby room to smell bad and do not want to worry buying special bags all time. This is the product for you.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won\'t topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pale and wouldn\'t dream of trying anything else.  It is great that you can use regular trashbags and not have to buy expensive cartridges.  So far it has done great on containing the odor and I like how easy it is to use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Worth every single penny and then some! I orginally registered for the famous ""Diaper Genie"" but was so thankful that my mother-in-law purchased this one instead after doing some research of her own. No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can\'t beat that! I am even thinking of purchasing one for my upstairs as well. Definitely the best one on the market.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got this for my daughter and I just think it\'s great. We have this in her room and I haven\'t smelled any ordors coming from it except for when you open it up to take out the bag. I also love the fact that you can use just regular bags. I know of someone that had a diaper genie and she still had a diaper in it from when her baby was born and she was about 2 months at that time. I\'ve found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there. I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven\'t had to try this yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I\'ve broken several nails on it.  I\'ve only had it a few weeks (I\'ve been using it for my toddler\'s diapers until my new baby comes), and I\'m hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it\'s great that it holds more diapers, and it\'s SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don\'t need two hands for it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are cloth diaper users and were attracked to the diaper champ because it said it could be used for cloth diapers and it keeps the smell in unlike other diaper pails. We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes. Some of our diaper covers also got stuck in the mechanism and I had to take it apart with a screwdriver to avoid ripping the cover. Mine is now in a closet and I\'m using a regular garbage pail. If you are planning to use cloth, this is not the pail for you.If your are using disposables, I think this pail would be great since you can wad them up into a tight ball. It doesn\'t stink except when you open it to change the liner and it takes regular bags.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After reading the reviews and comparing with the diaper genie, I went with the diaper champ; mainly because it didn\'t require expensive refills. I love that i can use my own trash bags! I change the bags about 2 times/week and have not noticed any smells. I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning). Overall, highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the Diaper Champ. I fought with the Diaper Geanie throughout my first son. This is so much easier to use, the three year old has mastered it! Uses your own bags. Don\'t waste time with others.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Champ at my baby shower, and continue to thank my sister for it. My son can really drop a load, and you would almost never know it once it is in the pail. We do basic maintenance, like cleaning it every so often and spraying Lysol to keep it fresh. We save SOOO much money buying 150 ct 13 gal garbage bags for about $5. My one suggestion would be to change the bags out more ofen then needed, though. It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out. I highly recommend owning one. Good Luck!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is an excellent idea having the lid to dispose of diapers.There is no odor and extremely easy to use. Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don\'t change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c\'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it\'s a diaper, bad when it\'s,,, your keys.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This diaper pail is great. It is the third one that I have tried. I just wish that I had it 4 years ago with my first child. It is very easy to use. You don\'t need special liners or refills. A regular garbage bag works fine. I had the Diaper Genie and it didn\'t keep odors out. The Diaper Champ doesn\'t totally keep odors away, but it works just as well if not better than the others I have tried. The diaper champ is very easy to use. You only need one hand to ""operate"" it. My 2 year old loves ""helping"" out and can independently use it.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great diaper disposal system, but from reading many of the negative reviews I think there are many individuals who did not bother to read the instructions. the bag goes through the hole in the blue retaining ring,  then gets folded over the retaing ring and locked in place, at no point should any of the bag be out side the pale and if the bag is put in place like a regular trash can it will not seal properly and you will probaly get a smell. I can not comment on the few reviews who had a seal falure for I have not had mine long enough.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I read many reviews about diaper disposals and decided on the Diaper Champ and am VERY glad I did!  I had only heard about diaper genie but had never used it until I was visiting my brother who had one.  Now that I have used both, I am even more certain that I like the diaper champ!  With the diaper genie, you have to push the dirty diaper low enough so you can then twist the lid (the whole diaper sausage thing).  I didn\'t know that until I used it.  YUCK!  Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.  The diaper champ is much easier...put the diaper in the lid and then flip the lid from one side to the other.  Being able to use regular trash bags is what hooked me in but now that I have used it, I\'m sold!  There\'s no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.  Just keep a stick-up in the diaper champ, and you\'ll be fine!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Let\'s face it.  This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.  One cannot expect that it will be odor free.  Mine certainly isn\'t.  It is my fault, though.  If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.  But alas, I am lazy.  So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.  Works for me.  I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.  But that was my own fault.  I did not have it on the floor.  When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.  What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It\'s also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don\'t have to bend over so much to flip the lid.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"i love this diaper champ..not only does it save money on bags cause you use whatever brand you want it is bigger so it holds more and i havent had a smell come out of it!  My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!  Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in.  Wonderful item!!  (as you can tell i have use the diaper genie with my first child)  totally recommend the diaper champ!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This item is great, you can you any bags you want (unlike the diaper Genie)!!!!! It is great for the price!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!  After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down.  It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol??",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you can love a diaper pail that is...  The Diaper Champ is EASY to use (one hand) and very sturdy.  No parts to break unlike the other leading brand.  It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.  Here\'s a tip:  Tie dirty diapers in grocery sacks before depositing into the Diaper Champ.  NO SMELL WHATSOEVER that way!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"For my first born I purchased the Diaper Genie. It worked out well for the first 6 months. As the diaper sizes got larger the harder it was to get the diaper to fit. It would squish out the sides, making a horrible mess! So I purchased the wide mouth size. More $$! The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie. SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby\'s room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received my Diaper Champ at my baby shower for the birth of my first son 11 months ago. I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week! I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don\'t need to purchase any special expensive bags. One thing you might want to be careful of, however...make sure you do not throw loose baby wipes into the Diaper Champ or else the flip mechanism can become jammed and after time will not seal properly due to having to pull out wipes that are stuck. I love my diaper champ so much, I have asked for a second one for my upcoming baby shower for my second son.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am a second time mom who used the rival Diaper Genie the first time around and let me tell you that there is no comparison. The Diaper Champ is easy to use, easy to change and uses everyday garbage bags instead of the expensive refills. Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell. The Diaper Champ is not perfect, it sometimes feels as if it has filled up too quickly (i.e. maybe it\'s not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison. So, I would strongly recommend that you buy the Diaper Champ and not waste your time, money and patience with the other product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Great size, we only change each week but after 5 months the smell started to seep through and the nursery after 8 months is smelling too much of diapers now, despite airfreshners etc.  If my baby used this as a bedroom, he sleeps with us I would have replaced this sooner !!  I even washed it all our in bleach but the seals must have gone as its just getting worse.  I like the size though and love the fact you just put the diaper in dirty and swing the top over.  One problem with this is when it gets full the diapers get stuck - thats not very pleasent too.Going to BabyRUs this morning as after 8 months I decided today is the day its ready totally for a new one.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ.  It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn\'t contain the smell.  Babies \'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again.  I would say it\'s a product default.  We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out.  Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they\'re soaked, it wouldn\'t fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we\'d have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers.  I\'m pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter. I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions. While at someone\'s house, I saw the Diaper Champ. It was one that I hadn\'t seen very much in the various stores I shopped in. I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!!When I bought it, I didn\'t have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!! It is so simple to figure out how to use! My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!)I\'ve even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You\'ll love it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ. BUT, it really isn\'t that great in controlling odor. Sometimes diapers get stuck in the ""flipping tube"" and then you have to open it and pull it out... what a mess! It isn\'t all that easy to clean either.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We\'ve now had the Diaper Champ for a little over a year! We love it. It\'s better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn\'t smell! I highly recommend it. Drawbacks: it doesn\'t hold that many diapers at a time. We have 2 in dapers and we changes it 3 times a week or so. It needs to be cleaned pretty often or lots of mold and bacteria start to grow (on the parts you can\'t see until you take it apart). Lastly part of the fabric/plastic material has ripped on part of it so it is a bit harder to flip back in forth when you  put new dirty diapers in! Overall, this is a great product!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!!  The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.  The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby. We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2. After 5 months, we couldn\'t be happier with Diaper Champ. Here\'s a short list of the main reasons I\'d recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn\'t use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don\'t. They\'re way too small and don\'t hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there\'s not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don\'t need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It\'s perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We\'d come home and every time, they\'d gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it\'s not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it\'s gone. I can\'t think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who\'ve used it so far, don\'t need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pail. It keeps the diapers from stinking up your room/house. I also love that I can use regualer old kitchen bags and dont\' have to fork over extra bucks for special bags. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish that it held more diapers.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose this product because unlike the Diaper Genie you don\'t have to buy replacement bags, just pop in a tall kitchen garbage bag which we all have in our homes anyway.  I have twin boys and this product works great.  I recommend spraying it with Lysol and letting it air dry in between bag changes.  This works for me.  It also holds a lot of diapers.  I highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'m SO glad that we asked the sales associate at Babies R Us for help when picking out a diaper pail.  We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.  There\'s no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they\'re not changed often enough.  We don\'t have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.  Before buying ANY other diaper pail, compare it to this one first.  You\'ll be amazed at how easy it is to use.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love it, love it, love it!  This lives up to the hype.  You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don\'t change it or clean out.  You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.  It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it\'s no problem.  I have recommended this to all new parents!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been very happy with this pail.  The greatest thing... regular trash bags!!  The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND! Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor.  I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.  If the plunger is not going down, it\'s because you need to change the bag!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes.  It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing! :)",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After using this for 3 years, I still stunned that other people still use the Diaper Genie.  I\'ve even had other Moms tell me that they can\'t smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.  If anyone is having trouble, though, try:  a)  wrapping the tabs securely around the diaper; b)  using deodorant trash bags;  and c)  taking dirty diapers straight outside to the trash and using your diaper pail just for wet diapers.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I loved this compared to the genie. It is easier to use and less costly in the long run!!Two thumbs up!!!Now, only if it would spray a freshner on its own. LOL!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got the Diaper Champ because we thought it was smart to use regular garbage bags and not pay for the diaper Genie refills. BIG MISTAKE! This product does not keep odor in, and when you open it up to put in a new bag in, its all over. My daughter\'s room stinks because of this product and we are in the process of trying to find a REAL odorless diaper pail.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I returned the Diaper G**** that I was given but kept this!  It takes ANY garbage bag (no expensive refills) and is wonderful for controlling odor... that\'s especially important now that our little guy is eating solid food and making more stinky diapers!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband saw this after my first shower and said ""What\'s that thing for?""  He now loves it.  I do too.  Best of all, you don\'t have to buy specific bags, we use the bags from the grocery and they do quite well.  We\'ve bought some air freshener cans and put them in the bottom, because after 8 months of use, it\'s going to smell.  But the room does not carry the smell, only when you\'re on the floor near the genie.  My only issue is that I\'ve broken a nail or two lifting the latch to get the top open.  But it\'s infinitely better than having the smell!!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We received the Diaper Champ as a shower gift.  It worked great for the 1st 5 months.  As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I highly recommend this item.  It is a must!  I registered for the diaper genie and used it for about a week and couldn\'t stand it.  It broke,the refills are expensive and very hard to install.  Then I got the diaper champ.  What a difference.  Easy to use, just one hand, and no odors.  It uses just your basic tall garbage bags.  So you don\'t have to go out and buy special bags for it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills.  The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags.  Plus it\'s simple to use.  We haven\'t had a problem with odor at all.  It\'s a great product!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a 10 year old daughter and an 8 month old son. There was nothing like this when I had my first child and I really looked into the champ v\'s genie before I brought this and I have to say that I truly LOVE it. I change the bag once a week. My kids have to share a room so if it was smelly I would hear about it. I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new. Aside form that it is so easy to use with one hand, anyone with a wiggly baby will appreciate that. In fact I love it so much I am going to take one all the way to Australia with me for my niece since she can\'t get them over there. I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is easy, but horribly smelly.  I suggest saving your money and buying a regular trash can.  You will get the same effect, because this doesn\'t do anything special.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law\'s house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won\'t have a problem) and it works great, good design!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve given this can as a gift a few times now.  Once to a couple who were on their second child, their response was \'how\'d we survive through the first baby without that can\'.It\'s easy, ordourless, and clean.  What more could new parents on.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :),5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I\'ve been nothing but happy with it. I tried my sister\'s diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use. The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier. I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don\'t have to go looking for them. I\'ve never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it\'s worth it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have ours in our living room and you can\'t smell a thing.  It is a little difficult to open and it doesn\'t hold a lot of diapers, but overall it works well.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had a great experience with this product so far and have been using it for about 2 months.  I get absolutely no odors in the tiny nursery (even when my daughter had very smelly diarrhea), it\'s easy to use and DOES NOT NEED ANY EXPENSIVE REFILL BAGS (just regular garbage bags) and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.  I remember reading a good review about the Diaper Champ and deciding to get it.Honestly, it does a great job.  It does contain the odor to inside the Champ.  I have never noticed a smell in the room, even when it is full.  I have to admit, however, that when you open that bad boy up to empty it, it\'s pretty funky, but what do you expect?If you wrap up your diapers good and empty it before it gets so full that you can\'t squeeze another diaper into it, you will really be happy.  It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.  We use the scented bags, which we think helps a lot.Overall, we are very pleased with the Diaper Champ and would recommend it highly! (Only reason I rated it 4out of 5 stars is - nothing\'s perfect, I have a hard time giving out 5 to anything!)",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great product until your little one starts to play with the handle.  Because the flip-flop handle comes in contact with the dirty diapers when the bag gets full, curious fingers can pick up some nasty germs &amp; even poop if a diaper isn\'t wrapped up into itself (The Grandmas seem to have trouble with that).I have been very happy with the simplicity of the Champ &amp; using regular garbage bags until now.  However, my 14 month old loves to play with it &amp; flip the handle over. I just cringe when I think about what he gets on his hands.Also, the padding in the lid that keeps odor under control seems to have worn out after 1 year.  It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too. YUCK!Overall, I would recommend the Champ for infants because it\'s VERY easy &amp; you can use 1 hand, but now that I have a toddler I\'m looking for a pail with a locking lid.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son is now 5 mo. and overall, I\'m happy with the diaper champ.  I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags. Do not kid yourself that you will have an odor-free diaper pail--I do not think that is possible!  I would rate this as low-odor--I change the bag about once a week.  My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed.  Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing.  I do not wrap up the messy ones because of the leak factor, so I wind up having to open the lid frequently. The lid is a bit difficult to open, but I like that because when my little guy is more mobile he won\'t be able to open it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,The diaper champ is fantastic. You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags. There is absolutely no dirty diaper smell that comes from the Diaper Champ.Absolutely recommend this product.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this pail.  You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid.  Sooooo simple.  It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.  With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean.  (It also needs special cartridges).  With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second!  It holds more diapers too.  I definitely recommend it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was given the Diaper Geni and after a week of twisting, we bought the Diaper Champ.  This was a great choice.  There is no need to spend extra money on special bags.  We use ordinary supermarket bags.  In order to keep the smell under control, we sprinkle baking soda right at the bottom of the chamber.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got this pail because I felt it was good that it doesn\'t require you to buy ""their"" garbage bags.  But at the end I still didn\'t use it and just use a regular pail.  Now it\'s sitting in my basement.  The reason I didn\'t use it is because it is hard to open up the can to replace the bag and when you are actually cleaning a baby especially when it\'s #2 it is messy at times where you would probably get it in the pail before you flip the handle to dispose of it.  Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.  You don\'t need more work with a child.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Worst diaper pale ever!!  I\'ve had mine for 2 years now and I am throwing it away as soon as my second Decor arrives.  No matter how many times I clean the ""Chump"" it still stinks.  The diapers and wipes get caught in the drop hole and stuck wet wipes make it stink even worse.  Forget scented trash bags, they won\'t cure the smell of the ""Chump"".  Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it.  Forget this pale and go for the Decor.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don\'t know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it\'s sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is my second child. With my first, I went through the Diaper Genie and hated it ---her nursery always smelled, even though my husband regularly changed that annoying (and expensive refill, $5.00 for each refill adds up faster than you think!) diaper system, he even took it outside and hosed it down with Clorox bleach and sprayed it regularly with Lysol -- to no avail.We also tried the Neat Diaper disposal system, and it\'s pretty and works a little better than the Genie, but it still smells up the room.  The Diaper Champ wins hands down, I for one never had an odor problem and I love the fact that it\'s easy to use and easy to empty, it\'s also easy to dispose of the diaper with one hand (especially when you\'re holding and infant and don\'t want to leave a smelly diaper out of the pail), something I couldn\'t do with neither the Genie not the Neat pail.I highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diperchamp is easy to use, as other people have said. We bought it with our first child, but stopped using it before she turned one. It does not keep the smell in and with only one stinky diper in there my daughter\'s entire room would smell the moment you walked in.I really loved the diperchamp when she was a newborn and her dipers did not smell. Now that we are pregnant with our second child I am not planning on using it again because we did not use it for very long.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like BabyTrend\'s products. We also have a SnapNGo, and we also seriously considered the Trend High Chair. We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born. I think it does what it advertises and that is that it does a good job of keeping in the odors (we live in a 1 bedroom condo). Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean. Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don\'t spray water into the drop-in hole. The mechanism is not completely watertight and you\'ll trap some water in there. Myself, I\'ve actually done a thorough cleaning only twice. Most times I just spray Lysol inside after changing to a new plastic bag.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  You are better off just getting a garbage pail with a tight lid.  Not only did my daughter\'s room smell horrible, but I broke three finger nails trying to lift the lid.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ doesn\'t smell - how wonderful!  Also, there are no expensive bags to buy for it - you can use regular plastic bags!  Although it seems to fill up quickly(diapers tend to pile up in the middle), this is an absolute must!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I can\'t say enough good things about the Champ.  For my first son we had the Diaper Genie - but it didn\'t do the trick. (too $$ and too difficult to handle).For son #2, I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.  I still love it!  My son (who is now 3+ years old) is finally getting potty trained, but we still use it to hold the ""nightie night dypes""...  We\'ve been using it for 3+ years and it is still going strong.According to the reviews, I was careful to wrap the diapers before putting them in - which we had to do for the Genie anyway... For the REALLY MESSY ones, I flipped up the lid and placed it right in the bag - which was easy to do.My son still loves to pull the handle and say ""bye-bye"" to what he considers the magic trash can.  For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags. If the odor inside gets too strong, try using Febreeze -- it even works on the plastic!Strongly MOM Approved!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It is so much easier to use than the Diaper Genie (my sister has that) but it does have some problems.  We\'ve used it for a year now, and it never started to smell until the diapers did.  It generally only smells when it\'s really full or you\'re emptying it out.  I wouldn\'t say the smell is such a problem though.  Whenever I empty out the bag (love the fact you can use regular trash bags) I would wipe out the inside and saturate it with Lycol for disinfecting.  The only reason why I am going to have to buy the Diaper Genie now is that my 1 year old loves to put items (sippy cups, toys, etc.) into the hole in the top and flip the handle.  I didn\'t realize he could do this until one day when a sippy cup went missing, and after EXTENSIVE searching I found it inside the diaper pail!  Since then, I have caught him many times trying to do the same thing.  Over all, it\'s a good product.  I think if you smell strong odors coming from the Diaper Champ, it\'s time to clean and empty it!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My husband and I registered for the Diaper Champ without really knowing much about it.  We picked it because it did not require purchasing refills like the Diaper Genie (which my sister-in-law had and did not really like).  We really like our Diaper Champ because it does not require refills (it uses regular kitchen trash bags)and it keeps out odor completely.  I am recommending this to all my pregnant friends.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son is now 18 months old and I have to say that the diaper champ is one of our favorite purchases! We got it when I was pregnant in hopes it would keep our house smelling ok. Well, it does pretty well at that, you still have to change it out everyday, it is poop however!!! But the thing I love most is that I can just use my kroger bags!! With buying diapers and toys, I didn\'t need something else on my list to buy! What a great invention!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"... than deal with the odor from this pail.  Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn\'t help.  We\'ve moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVED my Champ for the first year as it was all I expected in ease, cleanliness, odor free with regular bag changes and the economical use of kitchen bags.  Then the liner began to come loose and get stuck in the tumbler and eventually had to be removed altogether making things a bit less odor resistant, but still manageable with regular bag changes, cleanings, airings and sprinklings of baking soda.  The real problem we have now is that no amount of cleaning and deoderizing the Champ after a bag change (about twice a week for us) has managed to eliminate the strong odor that seems to be clinging to the actual pail now.  We\'ve tried a number of disinfectants, deoderizers and air freshners, but they are no match for the offensive odor of the Champ even when clean and empty.  We are so disappointed in the short-term success of this product.  It has been removed from my son\'s room and we are now taking each diaper out individually and looking for another pail.  I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.  In light of our experience with the Champ, I\'d have to recommend not purchasing this pail unless you are prepared to replace it when it fails to do it\'s no-odor diaper duty in due time.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a two-year-old son and I love the Diaper Champ. We initially bought a Diaper Genie and used it for the first 9 months or so, but we really disliked it. It was difficult to use, loud, and then broke on us. We switched the Diaper Champ and love it. It contains our toddler\'s odors just fine. We change the bag once a week and when we change a diaper we make sure to roll it up tightly and use the sticky tabs to close it up.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift. This is much easier to use. You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags. I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is a great product and a good value for those on a budjet.  Using lysol after changing the bag works well.  I have used my Diaper champ for 3 years and it still works!! I recommed this product to everyone I know.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I also opted for the Diaper Champ because there isn\'t any refills. It is very easy to use, but is difficult to open. I\'m afraid of ripping a fingernail completely off everytime I change the bag. My problem is with odor control. There isn\'t any. My newborn daughter\'s room smells constantly. It only takes ONE poopy diaper to smell. Yes we do change the bag regularly per other posts. We had to keep a fan on in her room during the summer just to keep the odor from a choking level. No exaggeration! If the smell wasn\'t a problem, I\'d completely recommend this product.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It\'s so much better then the diaper genie. No special bags necessary! Occasionally there are some bad odors but it\'s nothing that can\'t be fixed with some febreeze or lysol!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby\'s room has absolutely NO odor because of the Diaper Champ.  The chamber holds many diapers ( a day full at least) with no odor at all.  I also love that it takes regular trash bags so it\'s economical.  I spray the top and handle daily with Lysol or use Clorox wipes in the receptacle to keep it sanitary, but otherwise NO ODORS leak out!  We change the trash bag daily but you could get away with two days.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We\'ve had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we\'re looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This thing freakin\' stinks. Literally. I changed the bags every 1-2 days and wiped with clorox wipes and sprayed with lysol AND used vanilla scented bagsand we could still smell the smells seeping through!! Now I just throw the diapers in the regular trash since I change the bags everyday anyway and we can\'t smell a thing now. Someone else told me this thing stinks and I should have listened to them.,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Almost bought a diaper genie and then read on-line reviews.  Glad we listened!  Very easy to use.  Easy to open to empty and easy to replace trash bags. Nice that you can use regular trash bags from any store.  So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.  If you look at the picture you might understand.  After you flip the handle, the diaper on the inside goes into the bag when the cylinder you place it in is vertical, or completely upside down.  On the sides, there are walls that are snug to the round part that flips around. It is between the round diaper flipper thing and the walls that stuff could potentially get caught.  It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We\'ve only noticed something in this space once or twice. We still recommend this product.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We\'ve had the Diaper Champ for 18 months, and it worked great, no smells, very easy to use, until recently.  Somehow (probably it got overloaded) the adhesive from a diaper snagged the foam that insulates the head of the champ and pulled just the teeniest tiniest corner out.  Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.  We\'re going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.  Check you Champ carefully to make sure that no mesh or foam are visible.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn\'t make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let\'s face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have one for the nursery and one downstairs in what we call our ""satellite"" nursery where we keep our pack & play. My daughter is nearly 8 mos now, and we use both of them pretty equally. However, the one in the nursery is smelly, the one downstairs you can\'t detect the slightest odor from. We change both of them out at least 2-3x/week. I tried cleaning out the smelly one, getting the foam soaked with lysol and letting it dry out in the hot LV sun - I figured the scorching heat alone would kill anything, but I can still detect an odor from it - it doesn\'t stink up the whole nursery, but if you\'re standing right next to it you get a whiff. The foam inside has just absorbed the stink and there\'s no getting rid of it. All of this being said, I don\'t know that there is any other diaper pail that is much better - my brother has a diaper genie and he says it stinks a lot, he has to change his every day. My girlfriend has tried a few different pails and doesn\'t think any one is better than another.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I wanted this style (vs. the Diaper Genie) because it uses regular kitchen trash bags.  This is a more efficient way to go both because you can buy these bags anywhere and they are less expensive compared to the specialty bags for the Genie.  The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.  Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and recommend it highly.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don\'t have problem with the smell.  I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.  We have to change the bag every couple of days, when it is not even full because it is pretty disgusting.So just because of that I would not recommend it.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The reason their are mixed reviews on the Diaper Champ is because not all Diaper Champs are created equal (hee, hee).  We purchased one and we loved it.  No odor, we loved that you could use any bag, we were very happy.  So happy, we bought a second one.  OH MY GAH!  It was horrid.  The odors were so strong we thought our nursery maybe toxic (not really, smile).  We thought maybe it was just us, so we called in for a second opinion (the Mother-in-law).  She started gagging, and that was our sign to bring in the gas masks and rid of the Diaper Champ.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.  In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands.  I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids.  I also use the Glad ""Odor-Control"" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).  The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.  I highly recommend it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents . . .When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie.  She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . .  The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . .  My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.  Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?  True, the mechanism sometimes won\'t ""swing"" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.  Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don\'t change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn\'t clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ\'s, Costco or Sam\'s check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.  The BJ\'s we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don\'t change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After reading how great this product was on the convenience of not having to but those expensive bags ( diaper genie) I registered for the diaper champ. What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The smell is HORRIFYING!!!! Needless to say I am now going to buy the diaper genie and those expensive bags. I shoudn\'t have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery. I strongly recommend that you DON""T buy the diaper CHUMP......",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This pail is  by far the best!  Great price, no special bags, high capacity, easy to use and most importantly...no odor!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Hands down....get this diaper pail... The only reason I ever even need to empty it is when it cant hold anymore! NEVER smells..ever! I change mine about every 2 weeks, like I said, only because thats when it seems to fill. Dont bother w/ the cheapies, this one is IT! Seriously....trust me! The reason why it never smells is because the diaper goes into like a seperate chamber before it gets to the bag, so the air never transfers.Theres nothing else I can say. This is perfection.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I admit when I was an expecting father one of my concerns was diaper changing, mostly because of the odors (anyone with me on this one?) As much as the odors won\'t go away during changing time, they do -as a matter of fact- dissapear once you throw the dirty diaper in the Diaper Champ. Put it in the top hole, roll the top with the handle, in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor!As if this were not already great, there\'s a big plus to this product, when you compare it to its biggest competitor, the Diaper Genie by Playtex. Although this one costs $5 the first time around, it won\'t require special bags as the Genie does, which cost $15 per set... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco, BJs, Sam\'s or your local supermarket, so rejoice! (for diaper odors are over when the diaper goes in); and don\'t spend too much money to accomplish such a mundane task: make sure you get your Diaper Champ!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift when my baby girl was born last year.  At first it seemed as the perfect way to keep diaper smells away; it worked like a charm.  Within four to five months it started to smell, it did not seal properly and the smell got impregnated on the plastic, it was impossible to get rid of it.  I tried to wash it, spray it, scrub it, but nothing.  Maybe the sealing system fades with use.  I used it till I couldn\'t anymore and two months ago bought the Diaper Genie.  Yes, you have to buy refils ... it does a great job a sealing smells.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.  For their last child they used another brand, and  were dissatisfied.  However, they love the Diaper Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bought this on amazon. Never saw it around. Went through 3 kids. Very well madeNever would smell poopy diapers. Just use a store plastic bag and then when it\'s full, justThrow away. Love it !",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is TERRIBLE at keeping the smelly diapers from only smelling in the container.  Our baby\'s room was constantly stinky (due to the Diaper Champ, not the baby!), and we were having to empty the container almost daily.  What\'s the point of having a diaper disposal system if you can\'t dispose of diapers efficiently?  Please don\'t buy this product unless you enjoy smelling those dirty diapers.  The Diaper Champ just doesn\'t work.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We researched all of the different types of diaper pails, including the Diaper Genie which some of our friends have, but this one takes the cake. Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal. Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go. When you are done, just pull the handle from one side to the other, and presto, you\'re done. It holds around 15-20 diapers (I have changed it probably twice a week), and you just open it, tie the bag and take it out. To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL! I highly recommend that. And you don\'t need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution. You don\'t need the Genie. My best friend has one, and not only does it stink (literally), the whole ""special bag"" thing irks me. Give this guy a try. I am so glad we did!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Clean, economical, simple. Never experienced any odor ""problems""; we just empty the receptacle every other day.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I laughed when my husband wanted this product.  I felt it was  a waste of money and that you could just throw the diapers in the garage.  Well thats not a good idea.  We have the diaper champ and never smell anything.  This is a great item that every parent needs.  Its easy to use, and you can use your own bags. We actually use kitchen bags, and they hold quite a few diapers. We only have to change the bag out about once a week. I can\'t say enough great things about the diaper champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You cannot imagine how much money you\'ll save and it doesn\'t smell AT ALL!!! You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag. IT\'S WONDERFULL!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought this trying to save a few dollars and when I received it I thought it felt and looked real junky. After using it for over a week I have to admit I was wrong. I have 2 babies in diapers and the Diaper Champ keeps their room smelling GREAT. It is extremely easy to use and it has the added advantage that one can use ANY plastic bag with the Champ.It is an all around great, helpful and inexpensive product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As a Mother of 9 month old twins, I go through plenty of diapers.  We\'re moving to the U.K. in a couple of weeks, and after not being able to find a \'Champ\' anywhere overseas, I\'m having one shipped to our new home.  We\'ve never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.  I highly recommend this product to anyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wanted this diaper pail over the Genie b/c I liked the idea of being able to use standard trash bags instead of special refills, plus I have NEVER been able to get a Diaper Genie to easily work!  Now that I have the Champ, I\'m glad I got it, because it\'s very easy to use, however there are a few things I don\'t like about it:1.  It\'s hard to get the lid open...I\'ve broken several nails and hurt my hand trying to pop the latch open.2.  Because of the funky ring on the inside that I haven\'t yet determined the purpose of, the diapers get clogged near the top so that the handle can\'t be turned.  There is generally more than enough room left in the trash bag, so in order to avoid changing a bag that is only a third of the way full, I have to open the lid and adjust the pile of diapers or rock the pail back and forth so the diapers fall and I can continue filling.3.  A diaper got jammed in it once when the sticky tab stuck to the foam seal in the plunger.  The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.  The pail still works fine, but now the plunger is loose so it bangs around when you turn the handle, which makes more noise than before.4.  I have noticed a smell on occasion, but I expected as much...it\'s a plastic can full of poop...it\'s not going to smell like roses!!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like some features of the Diaper Champ. I do not find that it is odorless at all. I do like the one-handed operation of it. However, my toddler is constantly putting things in it and I have to paw through the dirty diapers to see what he\'s thrown away before I dispose of the bag. Using regular trash bags is nice, but I think there is something to be said for scented liners.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"For some reason, Amazon first sent us this product used...complete with poop stains!  We were very disappointed but they redeemed themselves by sending us a brand new one.  Now we are very happy with it.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We gave away our Diaper Genie and bought 2 of these when our second child was born. You use regular garbage bags and it takes less than a minute to change. No bad smells - no expensive liners. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for almost 5 months now and love it. It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay. I would recommend hosing the inside with Lysol after each bag change.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Wow!  This is fabulous.  It was a toss-up between the Diaper Genie and this one, and we decided on the Diaper Champ since you didn\'t need refill bags to go with it.  I go through a TON of diapers a day (I have twins) and instead of making a hundred trips to the trash can in the garage to get the poopie stink out of the house, I use this...and it works!  Absolutely no smell escapes from the Diaper Champ and I can use plain kitchen garbage bags in it.  We\'re very pleased with ours.  Spend the extra five dollars on this diaper disposer rather than settle for the ""Genie"".",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a friend that had the Diaper Genie and complained of it smelling on occasion.  My husband and I were a little leary of purchasing a diaper pail, but decided to give the Diaper Champ a try!  I am so glad that we did!  We have been using it for almost a month and it is great!  It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!  I would definetely recommend!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We liked this diaper pail because it uses regular trash bags.  It definatly keeps the smell contained, but, it will only hold about 15 to 20 dirty diapers before it gets clogged up.  When it is full, the lid won\'t turn over without some force.  This is a minor annoyance and it just needs to be emptied more often.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It\'s true, it does not work as well as the diaper genie. I am going back to that. I have used both and I can assure you, this product does not contain smells - I even put it in the closet, and still we smell it! Save yourself the money.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose this pail because I didn\'t want to spend alot on a daiper pail.  In the end, I spent more because I had to buy a different one.  After only a few months of using it, the seal broke and  the odor came through.  The latch would get stuck making it difficult to change the bag.  This is certainly not worth buying!!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.  You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This odor absorbing champ even absorbs the odors from those diaper genies down the street...  My one step diaper champ sure beats the 5 steps it takes to twist a diaper in the that genie.  Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is? - The CHAMP is icing on the cake - every mommy gets psyched when their boy (or girl) poops because it means everything is working... and when you toss that diaper into the the mini R2D2 unit, you know you did it right... simplicity... ahh...",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This was great for first 5 months of my baby girl. But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner. First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor. Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine. But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.I am now looking at the diaper genie.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Very easy to use, no smells at all. No special bags to buy. An easy decision.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I think this should be a staple in every household with a child!  It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.  The fact that you can use regular trash bags is a BIG plus because you don\'t have to stock up on refill\'s or run to the store when you realize you don\'t have anymore.  There is no oder (until you open it up to empty) and it is easy to use..great item!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent product. Holds nearly a week of soiled diapers without release of any unpleasant odor.  Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.  Would recommend that others purchase.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love the Diaper Champ, just wish it could hold more diapers! Really, I can\'t smell anything once the diaper is in there and it\'s very easy to load and unload. Plus, the price can\'t be beat.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Diaper Champ at my baby shower and have been using it since day one.  I loved it when I got it and now that I have used it for 1 1/2 years, I still love it!(First of all, if you have a poop smearing issue in your Diaper Champ, it\'s because you don\'t know how to roll a diaper closed and seal it with the tabs.  That\'s just gross, sorry I had to go there.)  Now that I have made my previous comment, even after the weight of the plunger pushed the diaper down, I have never had the issue of a ""dirty"" plunger.  The only cleaning I do to mine is wipe it down with a Clorox wipe once a week and spray it out with Lysol disinfectant spray everytime I change the bag.  I also use Glad Odor Shield kitchen bags in mine and I have never had an odor problem.My Diaper Champ is still in great condition, never had a broken part and never had a reason to need to take it a part.I would HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone who needs a WONDERFUL diaper pail.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is one of the best things that we got as a shower present. It requires no additional expense, other than regular trash bags (unlike the diaper genie) and it really works! I was skeptical that it blocked odors as claimed, but I am convinced: I forgot to change a full bag of dirty diapers before we left for a week of vacation (we have no a/c and it was really hot that week) ...We came home a week later and our daughter\'s room didn\'t smell bad at all.I do use Glad trash bags with the odor guard, wipe it out occasionally with Clorox wipes and I do keep a drier sheet in the bottom of the diaper champ just to ensure that it remains ""nice"" ... but that\'s more about keeping it clean than anything else.Bottom line, the diaper champ is something that we absolutely couldn\'t and still can\'t live without!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.  It is easy to change the bag, uses any trash bag, and does a decent job of containing odor.  I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.  I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.  Let\'s face it....no diaper pail is perfect, but this one is the best that I\'ve used.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that\'s why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought...""Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won\'t have to purchase any liners""...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn\'t stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don\'t think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I\'m taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We opted to register for this diaper pail because it didn\'t require costly refills.  It seemed to work well at first, although the changing of bags was a bit of a pain.  By the time my son was 8 months old, the pail began to stink a lot.  We always wiped it down and sprayed it with Lysol.  Eventually, a piece of foam from inside (I\'m guessing this helped to keep the smells inside) came loose.  We finally had to throw it out when my son was 9 1/2 months old. My neighber who had a baby at the same time also owned the Champ and had to toss her\'s out when her daughter was 5 months old.  The same thing happened to her.We are now expecting our second child and are in the process of buying a new pail - probably the Neat System.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got the diaper champ at my baby shower and used it from the begining.  It was wonderful, it didn\'t smell and it held LOTS of diapers.  I was glad I got it after finding out from my sister that she had to replace her bag from her diaper genie every other day in the begining and then a least 2 times a week when my neice was older.  At $6 a bag I saved a ton of money with this product.  However now that my daughter is a year and on all regular adult foods the diaper champ isn\'t holding in the smell very well at all.  I\'ve been replacing the bag every day to prevent the smell from getting too bad but it\'s a pain to do so I\'m thinking about getting a different diaper disposal system for now.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is such an easy and clean way to dispose of dirty diapers! Quick, one hand operation & NO odor problems!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Champ is a great diaper disposal system, but smells do leak out.  As soon as you open the system to take the bag out, all of those diapers do smell up the place!  I can not say that I am 100% satisfied with this type of disposal system, I just wish there was a better way of taking out the bag without smelling up the entire room!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Great diaper pail. It is very simple. Uses any bag. I haven\'t had any problems at all with it and it holds odor extremely well (until you open it!) But all in all a great diaper pail....definitely recommend!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I did love this product for the first year. but my oldest is 3years old and we\'ve been through two of these and now off to buy something else for my 15 month old. The seal on the cover doesn\'t last long which is why it smells. When we first get the new one it works great for a few months and then it starts smelling. We change it every other day and my 3 year old is potty trained so I\'m only using it with one toddler. The fact that you don\'t need to buy special bags is great but I wish they would figure out a better way to contain the smells.,3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this one because it can be used with cloth or disposable diapers and uses regular (ie. cheap) garbage bags.  For cloth diapers, you can even use a laundry bag.  Since we are using both cloth and disposables, we have two!  The system works great and there is no noticeable smell (although our son is a breastfed baby, so smell is at a minimum anyway).  We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.  Make sure the velcro is fastened before turning the handle to dispose of the diaper (and make sure your husband does this as well!).  I have heard that you shouldn\'t dispose of loose wipes without putting them in the diaper first.  Since we are using cloth diapers, we often throw the disposable wipes in the disposable pail loose without a diaper and have had no problems so far!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"While the diaper champ is not perfect, it is really good! No special bags to buy! One hand diaper disposal and very easy to clean! I change the bag 2-3 times a week and before I put a new bag back in I use mr.clean and clean it up real good. No odors and really easy!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I\'ve worked with kids more than half my life. First as a babysitter /nanny and now as a mother. I\'ve used diaper genies and they\'ve all been really smelly. I never had to deal with changing cartridges but I can imagine how annoying it could be to open that stench-filled object and take out the poop sausage. I love my diaper champ. It\'s so easy to use. I never had a problem with it squishing my finger because I always remember that the lid is heavy. No smell escapes from it and I keep it in my bathroom. We\'ll see if I still love it once my DD\'s soiled diapers become stinky.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ.  I prefer the Diaper Champ because it does not utilize expensive refills and it keeps the odor in better than the Diaper Dekor.  The Diaper Dekor broke, the arm that lifts the lid up broke off.  So I had to go searching for a new product again since they discontinued the model that I was using.  I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.  Let\'s face it, even the best can\'t keep in that smell, especially as your child gets older.  I have two children now, so the Diaper Champ is getting utilized quite a bit and it beats the competition hands down.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is much better than the Genie, it doesn\'t smell as bad if you take your trash out on a regular basis.  The only way I can keep it from smelling is to put a cloth wet with pine-sol in the bottom.  This generally works for 3 or 4 days. However, the capacity is not that great especially if you have twins!  (But what is except for a 33 gallon trash can with a hole in the top!)  The capacity is really the only thing I can complain about, even with one baby it seemed to fill up pretty fast.  It is convient, no twisting, turning, or shoving the diapers like you have to with the Genie.  And the use of any bag is great, too!  Although, it seems to tear everytime I change it.  Overall, for the price and for one baby, it\'s not too bad.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I researched all the available options and decided to try the Diaper Champ instad of diaper genie. It made diaper disposal a snap!! The one handed disposal was soo convenient when i was holding a squirmy baby with one arm. It is smell free if you empty frequently and almost so if you don\'t. This thing lived next to my sidetable for the first few months and often it was only emptied when it was full (its pretty large). I used some simple tricks to prevent smell leakage:-Rolled and taped up the diapers securely before disposing-Always returned the handle to original position so that only one side of the opening stayed in contact with smelly diapers (you\'ll know what i mean when you use it)-Used scented odor lock GLAD bags and aired out the champ between bag changesThe only cons I found were that opening it is a bit tough ( you get more adept at it though and its safer) and there is a small opening below the handle which is where the odor tends to escape when it does.The cons are pretty minor given how well this thing works AND it is cost effective...i hate the idea of being forced to buy brand specific refills. It may seem bulky and not great to look at but I have to admit i have at times emptied the champ only when it could not take a single more diaper. I almost returned this when i opened it and saw how large it was but i am so glad i kept it!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ - it makes diaper changes quick and easy. We make sure to wrap up all the dirty wipes in the dirty diaper before depositing it, so it doesn\'t get stuck in the shoot. Each time the bag is full, we empty the pail, spray Lysol inside and out, and replace the bag. We\'ve had it for almost 3 months now, and can\'t complain.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product has been great.  It\'s easy to use, holds plenty of dirty diapers, takes any kind of bag (this is important!), and does not take up too much space.Once in a while the drum gets stuck, but that\'s only when the pail is too full.Great product!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this over the Genie because you could use regular kitchen bags and with a greater capacity you wouldn\'t have to change the bag as often.  I was wrong on the last point.  Because it doesn\'t keep odor in as well, you really still need to change the bag often.  This from a mom with a breastfed baby, and supposedly breastmilk diapers have less odor.  In addition, it is a little tricky to open and close the bin.  The blue insert that holds the bag in can be difficult to manipulate.  No big deal.  I am still glad we chose this over the Genie, all things considered.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.  I have emailed Baby Trend for a refund so I can go buy something else.  I am even nursing my daughter and the stench from her &quot;odorless&quot; pail is horrific.  I cannot believe they didn\'t make a space for a deodorizer.  I\'m pretty shocked at how bad it is!,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I don\'t think this pail really did everything I was expecting, which was based on the content they provided on their site.  I had a hard time opening and closing it, and honestly the smells containment was not any greater than a normal trash bin.  Cute design, but not worthy of higher expectations.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I had tried a Diaper Genie at a friend\'s house and wasn\'t really impressed with how it worked, not to mention the idea of having to buy refills.  I registered for the Diaper Champ primarily because you could use regular kitchen trash bags instead of special refills, and all the good reviews it seemed to get.  I could not be happier with the Champ!  It is truly the easiet thing in the world to use--one hand is all you need.  We have not noticed an odor problem at all.  Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can\'t imagine other systems aren\'t the same way.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone having a baby!  It is by far the best thing I received as a shower gift.  You won\'t be disappointed in the Champ!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product was great for the first couple months.  It IS very easy to use, there\'s no twisting or struggling with the special bags, but when your little one starts foods and their mess gets a little more stinky, this pail does nothing to contain the odor.Here\'s the problem...there\'s no seal on the lid.  Where the lid opens to get the bags in and out, it\'s plastic against plastic that\'s not even remotely air tight that constantly leaks the stench of the inside.  Also, the chamber where you place the diaper gives you a waft of diaper pail air each time you flip it.I\'m realistic that it IS a diaper pail and is it going to smell, but this product could do a much better job.  I DO empty mine at least once a week, wipe it with disinfecting wipes, spray it with lysol and let it air out for at least one day before it goes back in her room.  The problem is, you just can\'t get to all the surfaces in the top of the pail.  I spend more time struggling with this thing, cleaning it, and airing it out than is realistic.Save your money on this one.  The cost of not having to buy the diaper genie bags is not worth smell in my little darling\'s nursery.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I nannied for two babies in some one else\'s home and they have the Diaper Champ. I think the reason parents don\'t smell the diapers when using this product is because they get used to the smell!! I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house! Finally, I had to start using the ""champ"" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can. Although I\'m sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born.  We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ.  The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child.  This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors.  We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products.  And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products.  So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months.  We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags.  And changing the Champ\'s bag is very easy.  But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable.  It really is true that babies\' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids.  So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie, and are now very happy with the Genie.  The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.  1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie\'s twisting mechanism.  2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.  The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.  The hood and ordinary trash bags don\'t do much for odor prevention.  The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ\'s.  We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We registered for the diaper champ after comparing it with the diaper genie and diaper dekor at the store.  We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.  Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.  It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn\'t yet.  We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.  I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pail!  It\'s so easy to use and I haven\'t had any problems with diaper odors.  I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.  Save yourself some money and hassle and buy the Diaper Champ!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I decided to buy this because we did not want to be tied down to any expensive refills. We are very happy with our decision. It is odorless, easy to operate and holds good amount of diapers.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The champ is great because you don\'t have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that\'s inevitable!  Here\'s some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don\'t expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you\'re like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I just wanted to say that I love my Diaper Champ (I use it with my Fuzzi Bunz cloth diapers) and I have never had a problem with smell. I think it also makes a big difference whether or not you breastfeed or artificially feed. I only breastfeed so I never have a problem.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought the diaper champ, because we heard all the others where over priced, espeically with the refills. We liked how with the this diaper pail you could just use regular trash bags. It worked very well and we where very happy with our purchase until it started to get warmer out, and our son started to eat foods. It smells! We keep it in our son\'s closet with an air freshiner in it! It\'s good while they are young, right now i think any trash can would do the same.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to agree with the other moms. At first the Diaper Champ was a champ, until I had to change the bag.  It is difficult to open, not to mention everytime I did change the bag my nails would break (and I don\'t have long ones).  My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks.  Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room.  It penetrated into the room.  Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside.  I was changing the bag on an every day basis.  This is by far the worst product out there.  Take my word for it when I say, I rather take the walk and dump the diaper outside than have to use the Diaper Champ ever again.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wanted a diaper pail that didn\'t stink. I\'d heard from *everyone* I knew that had purchased a Diaper Genie to not bother looking, nothing out there stopped the stink. ""Just take it outside right away"" was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did! I found this Diaper Champ - no refills - a definite plus - you just use your regular kitchen garbage bags. Convenient, and less costly!But the big question is - did it work? Did it keep the stink out of my baby\'s room?? I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES! It works!Now, if you hover right above the opening and inhale deeply, you will catch a whiff of poo. But who does that?? Sceptical friends who had owned the Diaper Genie (the ones who swore nothing would work!) were thrilled and a little jealous that this thing works so well!I\'ve never had an issue with ""skid marks"" as another reviewer posted - 11 months, skid free so far. I have had a seal loosen, as another reviewer mentioned, but as he said - it has not affected the odor prevention of this.Word of warning - it works so well that you will not be prepared for the odor you will get when you open this to change the bag. Hold your breath!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is the best thing ever. Easy to use and no need to buy expensive refills. I bought cheap trash bags and only have to replace it every 3-4 days. I also bought a stick up and placed inside so when I changed the bag the smell wasn\'t so bad. This is definately a product I would tell everyone to buy.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am one of those super-critical shoppers who researches everything about a product and then second-guesses purchase decisions...but I love this diaper pail.  I was completely satisfied with my purchase and even bought a second one for our upstairs bedroom.*It really is cost effective.  You don\'t have to spend money on refill bags.  I just use the pastic ones from the grocery store.  They work perfectly.*It is so easy to use, so easy to change.  I tried another brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no.  You should spend zero time disposing of diapers and all your time with your new baby.  The Diaper Champ is effortless.*It effectively keeps the room from smelling like dirty diapers.  I live where it is hot and humid and don\'t have central air so smell containment is important.  It\'s not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.  Scented bags makes the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensitive nose.*At first I was turned off by the look of the diaper pail, but I have come to appreciate its design.  I bought and tried out a different one and found that the Diaper Champ is taller (about 27"" high) and narrower.  This means that it takes up less floor space but still holds quite a few diapers (I empty it every 2-3 days).  Also I don\'t have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.*A small but considerate detail--there is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you change the bag.  This along with the way the weight is centered in the design makes it so the whole thing doesn\'t fall over when you open it to change the bag.  The other brand I had tried kept falling over when I tried to change the bag and it was incredibly frustrating.*The only thing against the product I would mention is the noise.  It makes a ""thunk"" when you dispose a diaper into the pail.  I don\'t mind it during the day--it\'s actually kind of fun to use.  But during night-time changings you have to flip the handle a little slower so it doesn\'t make a noise.Anyways, I hope this helps.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this thing! I don\'t notice any smell while top shut. It is simple to use, simple to clean. The top does jam when the bag is full, but what else would you expect. I like that because then I know its time to change the bag.I don\'t know what I would do without this thing!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had the Diaper Champ in my son\'s room for 6 months and all of a sudden the room smells like dirty diapers all the time.  The smell is starting to linger down the hall.  I cleaned the diaper champ, let it air out over night and then sprayed it with lysol and it is still stinking up the room!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using a d. champ for nearly four years now - it has been very convenient, easy to use, and as close to odorless as one could reasonably hope.  We bought it for our son, and when his little sister was born, we bought a different one because the store we were in didn\'t have a champ.  When my son learned to use the toilet, we got rid of the new one and moved the champ into my daughter\'s room.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We heard bad stories about the diaper genie and decided to go on a recommendation for the ""Champ.""  Boy, are we glad we listened. I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.  Definitely worth the investment and very easy to use - especially in the middle of the night.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product. It is so easy to use and there are no refills. I can use any kind of kitchen bag. There is a smell of course when you change the bag, but it is no big deal, it is just until you tie up the bag.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My daughter is about to turn 2 and I am starting to potty train her, so it is time to sell my Diaper Champ at our next yard sale.  I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.  After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.  Do not buy this if you are looking to avoid diaper smell--you will probably be disappointed, especially since this product costs about $30.  What I\'m currently doing is what other reviewers have said--I just put the dirty diapers in with the kitchen garbage since that gets taken out frequently.  (No, my kitchen garbage is not actually in the kitchen, it\'s on the other side of a safety gate in the adjoining laundry room.  Those of you with toddlers understand I\'m sure.)You know what IS nice about this diaper pail though?  It keeps your kid out of the dirty diapers. When my daughter started getting into everything, at least I didn\'t have to worry about her getting into the nasty diapers and doing anything with them.I don\'t think this product is worth $30.  It\'s essentially a plastic garbage can with a nifty lid.  It should probably cost half what it does.  If you get this, try using the plastic grocery store bags and taking them out more often.I want to add one last thing for those parents that don\'t know--a lot of parents aren\'t emptying poo from diapers into the toilet before throwing away the disposable diaper.  This is something you are supposed to do, not just for cloth diapers.  That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade. I realize this takes some of the convenience out of it being a disposable diaper, but it is something we all need to be doing.  It\'ll also help cut down on the diaper stink of course.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This thing doesn\'t work very well. It still smells up the room. I\'ve found the only way to not have smelly diapers around is to throw them in a grocery bag, tie it up and put it outside. It\'s cheaper too.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have used our diaper champ for the last 7 months and it is great. It doesn\'t stink, it is easy to change bags, and you can use any bags you like.  I use our standard kitchen garbage bags.  I have tried the diaper genie and hated it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product is nice in theory but not all that its cracked up to be.  The foam lining comes out after several months of use (this happened to 3 other people I know too), and it does nothing to stop odor.  (If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).  Save your money and buy something else - this champs a chump.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Got this for my baby shower, after reading all the reviews.  I have never had a problem with mine.  I uses odor controlling garbage bags, and you never smell any dirty diapers.This product is great!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It does contain most of the odors but not all.  It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures.  It will save you money on refills so that\'s a plus.,3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby is now 8 months and the can has been helpful.  I think it\'s great to make sure the really smelly ones are sealed, especially if I can\'t run to dump the trash outside.  I do usually bag the really bad ones, so I don\'t dirty the the entry.  It\'s also great now that the baby is crawling.  She can easily knock over a trash can, but the Diaper Champ is much heavier and she hasn\'t been able to get into it.  I doubt she will be able to get into it even when she is older.The bags are easily replaceable and affordable, far more than other options.  My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.  My friends liked my choice.You do have to empty the Diaper Champ can and clean it, but since it holds some pretty toxic trash, I would recommend that with any disposal system.  I\'m extremely satisfied.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Have had no problems with this! We use regular scented trash bags & empty out twice a week. No issues with smells, but we keep it in the bathroom and use scented trash bags so that may help. We used the diaper genie with our first baby & this one is considerably much better. Good price too!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Over the past several years, I have babysat for many different families.  In every home where there was a child in diapers, there was a Diaper Genie.  Recently, I had my first child, and I decided to try the Diaper Champ instead.  I am so glad that I did. I find it much simpler to use than the genie, and I have had no problems with odors.(I don\'t think this should be an issue if the bag is replaced every few days.)  It is also nice being able to use any garbage bag instead of having to purchase special bags.  I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the Diaper Champ and I plan to get another one!  I have one in the baby\'s room and I\'d like another one for downstairs next to her pack \'n play (since it has a changing table on it).  I feel like it keeps odors in as long as you do what other people suggested such as every time you take out a bag, spray and air out for a couple minutes and then replace with a new bag.  Also, I always make sure that I roll up each diaper securely before putting it in the diaper champ.  We only have to empty ours about every 2 weeks right now (our baby is 11 weeks old) because I change her downstairs half of the time.I really like the fact that you can use your own trash bags.  What a cost saver.  No special bags, no twisting (like the diaper genie), no tying special knots in the bags, no buying refills... as you can see I don\'t like the genie one bit.  As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.  Think of someone who comes to watch your baby - the diaper champ is so easy and they\'ll almost never have to change the bag for you.  That diaper genie was always full when I was babysitting.  Ugh!The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars, was because you can easily break your nails trying to open it up to replace the bag (the first time I did, despite the warnings!).  And the lid doesn\'t stay open for you to air it out unless you prop it open... but that\'s only for a few mintues anyways.  I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.  Speaking of hands, you only need one hand to throw away that messy diaper too!I highly recommend the diaper champ - in fact, I\'m buying another one today!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the convenience of not having to worry about special bags, that\'s why I rated this so high. However, when I first started using this diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter\'s diapers was getting stuck on something inside the lid.  Needless to say, getting the diapers unstuck was disgusting.  Once I yanked out the fabric that the diapers were getting stuck on, I really liked the diaper pail.  The dirty diapers still stink, so I put each dirty diaper in its own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbage so that they go out every night.  Now my house never stinks like a dirty diaper.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love this diaper pail.  I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.  The Diaper champ is easy to use single-handed, and is tall enough so you don\'t have to bend over much to use it.  We found it contains even the stinkiest diapers well, and can fit quite a few in there.  By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.  The plunger can make a loud \'thud\' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.  It doesn\'t seem to bother the baby, but I don\'t want to take any chances!  The other pail we use is very inferior.  It takes 2 hands to operate, is very short and doesn\'t contain the smell well.  We would buy the diaper champ for any of our friends having babies.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got one of these and a diaper genie for gifts. I decided to try them both out and see which I liked better. The diaper champ defintly won! I love not having to buy refills, my regular trash bags work just fine. It completly hides odors and is very easy to clean and use. It also holds more then the genie.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is one great diaper pail.  I cannot smell any diapers in my son\'s room.  It\'s easy to use.  Cheap to keep in trash bags.  And holds a week\'s worth of diapers.  Trash day we just empty it and out to the trash it goes.  Yeah for the Diaper Champ!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is a great for dirty Diapers. I have had no problem with smells. And it is easy to empty out. I love It!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you wrap up the diaper with the tape, it keeps the smell out just fine.  Also, because you can use any bags with the Champ, we used some cheap eucalyptus smelling bags and it\'s a lot cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was a diaper genie user until my son was about 1 month old.  I thought that it was hard to use.  We had a friend tell us about the Diaper CHAMP and told us to try it out.  The name say\'s it all.  Our son is now almost 2 years old.  We just quit using the diaper champ about 3 months ago just because it was just as easy to carry them out to the trash.  We have had no problems at with the diaper champ at all.  It does a great job on keeping the odor in the pail.  Sure, it smells when you change the bag, but you just seal off the bag, and smell is gone.  NO refills to buy or anything.  ITs great.  ITs a breeze to clean and empty the bag.  This is way better than the diaper genie!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it. It is taller than other diaper pails so you don\'t have to bend so far down to dispose of the diaper AND you can use regular kitchen garbage bags.  I didn\'t want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.  My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don\'t know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!  I am very happy with it and would gladly recommend it, especially if you are the least bit tall.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don\'t buy this one!,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like our diaper champ because you don\'t have to buy special bags and it let\'s you know when it\'s full.  We don\'t have any smell in our babies room, and she poops a lot.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in. It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don\'t need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie. It is also very user friendly in that you only need one hand, just drop in the diaper flip the handle over and you\'re done.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I paid $39.99 for this on Amazon and could have bought it in the store for $29.99.  WAY too overpriced!  I wish I had researched a little more.,2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Daiper Champ is a true champion. Earlier i was planning to buy Diaper Genie as i had liked its innovative style. However, all my friends were sick and tired of its refill system. Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food. It also need some assembly while as CHAMP is so easy to use and can take any size diaper, any trash bag and even a kid can handle it with ease.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the best diaper pail.  I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven\'t noticed any odors since we\'ve been using it.  I highly recommend this product to everyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVE this diaper pail!  Just buy regular kitchen trash bags! I haven\'t found a pail yet that\'s completely odorless, but this one is the best!  And my daughter can\'t get into it and pull the diapers out!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby\'s closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'m not sure about this one.  In concept, it\'s a fabulous idea.  I love that you don\'t have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don\'t believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I\'m concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like this diaper pail.  I\'ve had two others with our older kids--one a diaper genie (which I personally found to be a pain) and another by fisher price that I don\'t know if they still  make.We used this for all diapers for the first six months, until our baby started having solid food.  As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.  (Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don\'t personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)  My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.  It\'s easy to change out.  I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don\'t expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.  We still use it for the wet ones.  It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn\'t), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don\'t like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that\'s ridiculous on my part.  The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.  And the fact that you can\'t go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.  The longer they sit, the more rank they get.  Now that he\'s older and doesn\'t go through 15 diapers a day, I only change it about once a week.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought the Diaper Champ because it was recommended to us over the Diaper Genie.  2 weeks after using it we decided it wasn\'t for us.  It didn\'t hold the smells in AT ALL! Tried using scented garbage bags and that didn\'t help! Our room still stunk! I bought the Diaper Genie and while it does\'t keep the smells in 100% (you can still smell it when you open it to put another diaper in) and you have to buy the refill bags, it works a lot better than the Diaper Champ and the room smells a lot better than it did before.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was recommended to us in the Babies R Us asile by a nanny who was picking up one for one of the households that she was working with.  She loved her previous experience with the product, and we are glad that she spoke up to recommend it to us.Pluses: It is a LOT easier to use than the Diaper Genie (for example you can throw a diaper away with just one hand!  Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don\'t have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it\'s extra large containment area you don\'t have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn\'t specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.  After trying to get it apart for a ridiculous amount of time, (using practically everything from my nails to a crowbar,) I finally broke down and called the customer service number to see if I was missing some key- a button or lever to push- anything!  The customer service person told me to ""try harder"", then call again if I couldn\'t get it open!(Insert long pause with upraised eyebrows here.)Needless to say, I thought that was a bit less than helpful.  So... maybe my Diaper Genie was warped, or maybe they are all impossible to get open- it\'s your gamble.  I didn\'t take it back to the store because I assume that they are all that way.  On the bright side, I really haven\'t felt that it\'s gotten dirtier than a lysol wipe could handle- so despite that lack of helpfulness that the customer service folks could offer me, I would still recommend the product itself to a friend.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I went to Babies R Us to buy a diaper genie, but instead were intrigued by the diaper champ... the store was sold out, the worker said we should have them hold one for us because they sell out as soon as they get them on the shelves... I can see why!  I have already referred about 5 of my friends to buying one.  We live in a small house, and if something stinks in one room, it will stink up the entire house, so we are so glad to have something that really works for those dirty diapers!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Well, the first three months were odor free!!  Then after the charcoal chamber absorbed all the odor - watch out.  After the3rd month, it was intolerable!!  I am going out tomorrow to purchase the diaper genie or something better!!!  No matter how much you clean or how often you spray with Lysol the smell keepscoming back.  And they don\'t have a website to complain too!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am the mother of 9 children and this is the easiest diaper pail I have ever used.  It captures odors and it uses regular trash can liners so I don\'t have to buy any custom can liners, which saves me money and time.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My friends think I am strange, but I have to show my Diaper Champ off to anyone that comes in my house:) I recieved a diaper genie as a gift when I had my daughter three years ago and hated it. When I got pregnant this time, I decided to try something different. The Diaper Champ works great and I am saving tons of money not having to buy special bags. My 3 year old loves to turn the handle for me after I change the infant - some of my adult friends can\'t even figure out how to turn the Diaper Genie!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Unlike others, the Diaper Champ uses standard trashbags -- saving you headaches from trying to find the right bag and money because you don\'t have to buy a bag that only works in the Champ.  The Champ uses a wonderfully simple design to keep out odors and won\'t break.  The best part is that it is a full-sized can, which means you have to empty it less often.  The one drawback about not smelling dirty diapers is when you go to empty the Champ -- take it outside before you open it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don\'t have to purchase specific bags.  That\'s way too much of a headache and expense that I don\'t need.  It\'s also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven\'t had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn\'t want to do without.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The diaper wipes get stuck in the mechanism, making it unable to properly flip over. (edited, one year later to report:)I recently stopped using this item because the baby\'s room started to smell like urine, etc, after a few days. It didnt block the smell of the diapers. I am not sure diaper pails can really DO such a thing, but if they can, then this product isnt doing it\'s job. I started putting each diaper in a ziploc bag before throwing it away in this Diaper Champ, hoping that it would take away the stench of old diapers...no such luck. Now I just take the diaper with me and throw it away outside or in the main kitchen trash that gets taken out each night. I would take away my three stars and give two or onw, but I can\'t change what I put originally.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"A great product that works as promised.  I haven\'t had any problems with it accumulating odor, but I have a friend who did. I went to look at his and picked it up, it felt like it weighed 50 pounds! Folks, ya gotta empty it every few days, it can do only so much. The only con against it vs. the genie is that you should wrap the diaper tightly or the delivery chute will get soiled.  Other than that, it blows the genie away.  BUY IT.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are using the Diaper Champ with our first baby and we love it!!  We don\'t have a problem with odors because we keep a roll of diaper disposer bags (little roll of blue plastic bags with a yellow duck dispenser) nearby in the changing table to put the smelly diapers in - this keeps everything clean and the blue bags are extremely economical to purchase (maybe $3 for 50 bags).  A small price to pay for an almost odorless diaper pail - we only use them for poopy diapers, not for wet-only diapers so they last for quite a while.  The bag in the Diaper Champ still gets changed 1 - 2 times per week because it\'s full, not because it\'s smelly.  This method also keeps the chamber and plunger free of messes.  Since the Diaper Champ can be used with any garbage bag, it\'s one less thing to have to remember when shopping and changing the bag is so simple and quick, it\'s easier than changing our kitchen garbage bag.  We have relatives who are expecting babies and will be sure to encourage them to register for the Diaper Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ not only holds bombs, it is the bomb.  We used it for out first child 3 years ago, and are now using it for our new twins.  Holds in the odors so well, that even grandma occasionally makes a deposit herself!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been using the Diaper Champ for the past three months. It holds lots of diapers and you can stuff it full. I have not smelled any bad odor coming from the pail in my son\'s room. It is easy to change a new bag, but I would suggest doing it outside. Once you open it up the smell does escape quickly. But, just give a quick wipe with a disenfectant cloth and put in your own garbage bag and you are ready to put it back in the room. I am very happy to have this diaper pail. I recommend it.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love our diaper champ, and are so glad that a friend tipped us off to it. We had the diaper genie on our registry, but someone suggested that we get this instead--because we would save on bags. You can put any small size garbage bag in it- our local Target sells a pack of 90 for 1.99. Plus, from my babysitting days, I remember DiaperGenie being a little hard to use/empty. The diaper champ is easy, just throw the diaper in and flip! If you are trying to choose between the two, I\'d go for the Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"THis thing works!  There were 3 baby cousins born 2 weeks apart in our family, I have the Diaper Champ and the other 2 have Diaper Genies -- I am the only one using my diaper pail. They quit using theirs in a few weeks because of the smells.  They both feed formula and only have one poopy diaper a day, so they immediately remove it from the house. My baby is breastfed and has poopy diapers at most diaper changes and this Diaper Champ diaper pail has been up to the task so far, he is 8 weeks old.  Outside is easy to wipe down with clorox disinfectant, since sometimes the cylinder gets a little runny stuff on it if I don\'t wrap them up tight enough. When it  doesn\'t want to turn and drop all the way down, then that\'s when I know it needs changed. It\'s nice not to have to buy special bags too!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product because you can use REGULAR TRASH BAGS and you do not need to order ""refill bags"" to keep this unit operational!  It\'s easy to use, blocks all odors, and once you pay for the unit, there are no additional bags to buy...which saves you money in the long run!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This was my 3rd diaper pail with my 3rd baby.  This one was by far the best one and the easiest to use. You can use your own bags, which makes it a plus over the Diaper Genie.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally bought the Diaper Genie when my son was born. It broke when he turned 9 months so I bought another Diaper Genie. However, the Diaper Genie became very smelly as my son got older and onto solids. I decided to switch to the Champ and I think it\'s much better at handling odors. It also holds a lot of diapers. Not having to purchase special bags is a plus. Now, I agree with others that there is probably nothing out there that truly gets rid of odors, but I think the Champ does a good job. Just make sure the tape of the diaper is not exposed when you throw your diaper in the Champ and try and empty it as often as possible. My son is now 12 months and after 2 Diaper Genies and a Champ, I highly recommend the Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I had a cheap safety 1st pail and hated it. It fell apart and did not keep down on the stench AT ALL. I read a ton of reviews and thought...&quot;hmm  the diaper dekor sounds the best&quot;. However, I really did not want to deal with buying special bags and all that (plus the pail itself was more expensive). I know I didn\'t want the genie, so I tried the Champ. Since I have not tried the Dekor, I can not really say which is better. But the Champ is easy to use, inexpensive, and keeps down on the bad odors. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS (especially for people who are not rich and dont want to spend the time and effort finding and buying special bags)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"my son is now 3 months old and when he was born i didnt have a diaper pail.  well after reading the reviews i decided to go with the diaper champ. let me tell you, the only time it smells is when its full or you open it to change the bag, after that with a fresh bag, there are no disgusting smells. i love this pail and i dont have to worry about forgetting about needing refils and running out at 3 a.m. because i can use my tall kitchen bags! my 3 year old enjoys helping me change the baby because he likes to flip the handle.  this was my best investment for the baby!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It stinks - we lysol ours 2-3 times a week. Diapers get jammed and it hardly holds any. We are better off buying a flip garbage can lid for like $6 bucks. Same idea without the headache and the ""diaper pail"" look.The only good thing with this one is you can use any garbage bag you want.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got this for our newborn, and within the first two weeks of use, the liner (that I assume is supposed to keep odor in) fell out because it got caught on one of the stickies on the diaper. This pail doesn\'t really keep in odors anymore and we\'ll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I recieved this pail as a gift and loved the idea that it didn\'t require specifc refills packages. You can use any plastic garbage bag! It\'s easy to use and convienient. One minor detail is you don\'t know when it\'s full until you can\'t turn the handle any  more, but that\'s a small price to pay for this wonderful product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am glad I bought this! It uses regular garbage bags and there is no odor at all. It is so easy to use. Thumbs up on this one. I am glad I didnt get the diaper genie..it wouldve been a waste of money!I recommend this diaper champ to everyone!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Its a good product because its easy to use, and you don\'t need the expensive refillable bags like the Diaper Genie.  However, it doesn\'t do so good of a job hiding the smell.  We\'d spray the inside with Lysol disenfectant, but if we waited for the bag to fill up to capacity our room would be full of the dirty diaper smell.  So that\'s the only reason I give it a 4 stars.Its easy to use, and inexpensive when it comes to the refills.  Just doesn\'t mask the smell of dirty diapers that well.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"this works really well.  I found it easier than diaper gienie and you can drop in the diaper and dispose with one hand.  To keep odor down you need to change before it gets too full, couple times a week  or more often if have a couple poopy diapersYou also can use any bags.  I have one on each floor of my home.Also keeps the dogs from getting the diapers.  occasionally a diaper will get stuck but that is usually when it is getting too full.  Only prob I have found is when I push on the lever to open to change the bag it is kind of difficult to unlatch and have broken a nail on it a few times- no biggie, kind of annoying.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This truly is the champ of diapers. This product, unlike the genie and others, is standalone of ""refills"" (well, you do need garbage bags, but you should already have those). It also does a very good job of keeping the stink away. Not once has the smell came out in such a way that we notice.It also kind of reminds me of the ghost jail thing in Ghostbusters, you know, where they put the trap in and release the ghosts?It\'s a great product. It\'s kind of big, it\'s well made, and it will not need to be changed out for about a week. I\'d advise anyone to buy it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve read all of the reviews of those of you who can\'t understand why the rest of us hated our Diaper Champs, and I just have to say-give it a while, you\'ll find out. We bought our Diaper Champ when our first son was born. For pretty much  the first year we LOVED it. Everyone is right, you don\'t have to spend money on seperate bags, it\'s a nice height so you don\'t have to bend over it and it\'s really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you\'ll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven\'t used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I\'m not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I\'m not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I\'m talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you\'ll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie. We\'ve used it for two years now and have had no problems. It kinda stinks a little when you open it, but the smell stays in there when it\'s closed. I\'ll buy seperate bags any day if I never have to smell that foul Diaper Champ again.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I see that there are complaints of stinkiness regarding this unit, but short of hermetic sealing, you\'re gonna be dealing with poo smell. I think a bit of odor is a fair trade-off for the ability to use normal trash bags and not be locked into yet another system of expendables. (See Braun shaver cleaning cartridges, etc.) The unit relies on a fairly tight seal between the bag (where it passes through the dark blue plastic holder) and the ""funnel"" bottom on the underside of the top portion. If the bag installation is somewhat off this would probably lead to a poor to non-existent seal.That said, the design of the unit is pretty clever - the piston and gravity work to deposit the diaper into the bag in one fell swoop as the handle is rotated through a 180-degree arc, without any hazardous poking of fingers in the vicinity of fresh poo.  That the lid latch is not immediately easy to pop open can be seen as a feature - keeping the contents safe from rude dogs who knock over trash for the goodies inside.  All told it seems to work very well.",5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"I bought this pillow a month ago, and have been sleeping great ever since! I am 5 months pregnant, and had been sleeping with a regular pillow under my belly until i purchased this product. I am petite so i was always having to lift my belly to set it on the regular pillow, and i could feel my round ligaments cramping up. I haven\'t woken up with discomfort or pain since using this pillow! It keeps me from rolling on my back and is very comfortable to sleep on. I don\'t have any complaints with this product. However, i can see how it could be a problem for someone who tosses and turns at night, or for someone on the larger side, it may have enough back support.",5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"I love this pillow. I just bought it &amp; am finding that it keeps me on my side where I belong. Being a back sleeper is tough when you aren\'t able to do so. I only gave four stars because I still have lots of back pain, but hopefully I will lose it with more pillow use. I wish I\'d bought it LONG ago!",4
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"Although I\'m not extremely big yet, I wanted to try to get a pillow so I could get used to sleeping on my side (I\'m normally a back sleeper).I\'m in my 4th month and just bought this pillow. The first couple nights, I tried it as the picture suggested.  But I found that it wasn\'t staying the way it was supposed to, and it just wasn\'t comfortable.Then, a couple of nights ago, I just took the larger of the two wedges, and put that behind my back as I laid on my side.  I made sure my shoulder was comfortable, by adding an extra pillow under my head.  And ever since I tried this configuration, I have been sleeping much better. I think this is working for me, because since I am a back sleeper normally, this kind of feels similar to what I\'m used to, with the wedge on my back.Also, the past month or so, I\'ve been waking up with pretty bad lower back pain, but ever since I started using the wedge behind my back, I have had almost no back pain.I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble sleeping on their side and/or is waking up with back pain.",4
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"This pillow helps to support the growing belly, but I really bought it for my aching back.  The back support is minimal at best - it doesn\'t stop me from rolling over to my back nor provide a cushion of support to lean my back up against when I am tired of putting my full weight on my left side.  I have had this product for about 2-3 months, and now use it only about 1-2 nights per week.  But for the price, it is better then nothing.",3
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side.  The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product.  If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time.  I guess by that point nothing would have helped.  It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though.",2
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,I felt a complete difference the very first night I slept with the pregnancy wedge.  I regret not purchasing this sooner.  It truly makes a difference in our sleep - and we diffently need our sleep!  After the baby comes you can use it to prop the baby\'s head/body up when he/she is ill - another wonderful use.  This is a must buy and a great deal.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","My son is 18 months old, and I have been using this sheet for over a year (I now have 2 of them). This is a wonderful item for parents who don\'t have the patience for constantly changing a fitted crib sheet when baby\'s diaper leaks (and we all know this happens no matter what we do). I have read the warnings about babies getting stuck under the sheet, and while I agree that this is very dangerous, I have never had a problem with mine. I did have to exchange a sheet recently, however, because the elastic pieces and the snaps were sewn too close together, which made the sheet bunch up in several places &amp; not lay flat in the crib. I noticed that many of the sheets are sewn this way. Other than that, I highly recommend this crib sheet.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",We got 2 of these sheets as a gift and I feel sorry for the person who bought them. They don\'t stand up to any kind of washing and they\'re still dangerous. My wife and I finally gave up and made our own sheets that are much much safer. They\'re like larger pillow cases that fit over the entire mattress. Little more trouble to put on but our son can\'t get wrapped up in them no matter what.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I had high hopes for this product, anything to make our lives easier, especially for crib changes in the middle of the night.  However, I had to return this product for multiple reasons.  First, it does not attach properly to my crib.  I have a standard size crib, which a standard mattress fits in just fine (very snug) however the elastic loops do not attach to my crib rails correctly, so there are either loose elastic pieces that the baby could find and chew on, or it\'s stretch funny across the crib leaving lumps of fabric in the way, either way it\'s not appropriate.  Second, it\'s extremely hot. If you have a warm body baby, (s)he will be sweating in minutes laying on this thing.  Our little boy would be on it for less than five minutes then be screaming because he was so hot.  We have central air in the house, so it wasn\'t because the house in general was too hot. We had trouble moving him from his pack n play to his crib for weeks, until we realized that this layer could be the issue.  As soon as we removed it, he was perfectly content to sleep in his crib.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Love this. We keep several layers on the crib mattress: mattress pad/protector, sheet, then ultimate crib sheet. In case of nighttime accidents or illness of any sort, I can just pull the ultimate crib sheet off, have another sheet ready to go, and mattress is always protected. Deducted one star b/c both of our ultimate crib sheets balled up immediately with first wash. Not as bad with second sheet since actually followed washing directions, but still had some pilling of soft layers.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","It\'s kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It\'s not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don\'t have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I purchased two of these sheets for myself before our baby was born, and also one for a friend\'s baby after I had tried them for myself. These sheets are great. I first used it on my bed before baby was born just in case my water broke while I was in bed...which did happen! And the sheets protected my mattress and bedding beautifully. The same in my baby\'s crib. I also use the sheets on the floor when baby plays on the floor (on top of a softer blanket). The ultimate crib sheet is basically a soft sheet on one side, a rubbery backing with something soft in between the two. All the bedding you\'d probably put on the crib mattress but all sew together as one unit. Washes easily. I\'d get two, one for the wash, one for the crib. I use one brightly colored fitted sheet on the crib mattress under the ultimate crib sheet just to give a little bit of a decorative look to the crib since the ultimate crib sheets I have are plain white. I recommend this product and will be using again myself in the future.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby\'s cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Hi - In concept this is a great idea, but I want to make sure people know about certain limitations.  Because of the placement of the securing straps, this sheet CANNOT be used on convertible cribs with a solid headboard.  You must have slats on all 4 sides of the crib - or be handy with a needle and thread.Just want to make sure people know, as these sheets are expensive and I was very disappointed to learn that I am unable to use them.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Neat idea.  Although, I thought it was boring, so I wanted to put my sheets over it.  Well, it\'s not possible with the straps.  So, I have my sheets over it and it\'s not attached with its straps.  I never thought of leaving the sheets on underneath it to show through the sides until I read a review just now.  Perhaps if this was offered in colors as well as just white, it would be less boring.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I don\'t know how I would have managed without these! My  twin boys wet through diapers like crazy, and these sheets are a huge time saver... just snap them out, wash & dry and snap them back on. They are really soft too.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","works great to keep the mattress and sheets under dry.  It also is good enough to be used without a cover, my daughter doesnt mind it.  Its practical and good for the money paid, recommended.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","The first night we had our daughter sleep in her crib, we had to change her sheet in the middle of the night.  Needless to say, after my husband wrestled the mattress out of the crib and the sheet off the mattress, he was beside himself!  I ordered 2 of these ultimate crib sheets the next day.  They are a snap (literally) to change, and every nursery needs at least one.  Save yourself the midnight wrestling match with the mattress when you need to change the sheet - and go with the Ultimate!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I used these with my second child, and plan to purchase some for my next child.  They are so simple to use, and make those inevitable middle of the night changes so easy.  I used mine over the top of the decorative sheet (so the mattress would be covered), and therefore only needed to change the decorative sheet once in a while.  Very handy, since I had to wrestle the mattress out of the crib to get the regular sheet off!  It also snaps securely so the baby cannot pull it off.  I would recommend this product to everyone!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I purchased the Ultimate Crib Sheet for a baby gift. I\'m that crazy about this product. Like all of my favorite baby items (my babies are now almost 10 and almost seven), the crib sheet was a gift from a friend who too, loved it. You put your regular crib sheet down on the bed (the fitted one). This one snaps in over the fitted sheet, around the rungs of the crib. If your child poops/pees/vomits in the middle of the night, all you have to do is unsnap the top sheet (it\'s got a leak proof backing on it) and then you\'ve already got your regular sheet underneath, ready to go. No fighting with the mattress in the middle of the night. Getting a fitted sheet on the mattress is hard enough during the day; doing it when your child has other issues going on is a nightmare. This really is the ""Ultimate"".",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I love the Ultimate Crib Sheet - we\'ve been using it since our 22 month old was born.  You don\'t have to constantly lift up the crib mattress and fight to get sheets on.  It works very well and is a great time saver.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Buy 2 of these, so you can have a clean one ready while you do laundry.Usually, I write Good Things and Bad Things, but I have no complaints - so this time, only Good Things!Good Things:1) Easy to get on and off.2) Soft cotton top over waterproof bottom.3) You can put your \'cute\' sheets underneath, and really never have to change them, because they never get dirty. So you only need 1 set of pricey sheets if looks are your concern.4) What else do you need out of a crib sheet? :)",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This is by far one of the best products that we purchased for our baby!  I would recommend that any new mom buy at least two of these sheets.  They make middle-of-the-night accidents so much easier to deal with!  Simply unsnap to remove the dirty sheet and snap on a clean one.In a market where there are so many useless and difficult products available (and as a first time parent you feel obligated to buy them all!) this is a little ray of sunshine!  Too bad all baby products are not this simple and wonderful for parents to use.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I just recommended this item to a relative who is expecting.  In thinking about it, I realized that I have had the same 2 Ultimate Crib Sheets in continuous use with 2 children for over 7 years now!  What a time saving device!  It comes off in seconds--no fumbling around at 2 am trying to change a dirty crib sheet.  Crib mattresses fit very snugly in a crib, so it is very difficult to change them; especially with a bumper on.I also think that this is real safety device.  As your crib sheets are washed and shrink they tend to slip off more easily which we all know is a suffocation hazard for baby.  With this Crib Sheet on top of a regular sheet, you don\'t have to worry about the fitted sheet slipping off. It has also allowed me to buy only one really EXPENSIVE designer sheet which I use underneath.  It has never had to be washed and looks as beautiful (and expensive!) as the day I bought it!  I wish I had invented this product!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I\'m glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don\'t have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son\'s crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can\'t be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I recently attended a baby shower and gave this as a gift.  The mother had requested a couple of these.  Since then she has given birth and this sheet has been working well for her.  Great idea for a baby shower gift.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it\'s no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",We got these sheets because they got good reviews but I hated them. They don\'t wash up well. They bunch all up and fall apart after several washes. The elastic that straps to the slats doesn\'t hold up well to washing either. They look absolutely awful on the bed because they don\'t cover the whole mattress. I am tossing them in the garbage!!,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I\'ve had no problems with the product. No shrinkage, no getting under the sheet, no bunching, etc. I LOVE the UCS and have bought it for MANY of my friends.You gotta have at least 2 though.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I love this crib sheet because of its ease of removal and replacement and its protection against all leaks and blowouts.  A friend had recommended it and Im so glad she did.  From the side you cannot even see it is there because it sits on top of the sheet (it is nice to have the matching sheet for the set to look nice).  When a leak happens, just unsnap, throw in the wash, and replace when dried (or buy two which makes it easier).  That way you are not fighting trying to cover the mattress with a sheet each time, lifting and tucking, etc.  This does make life much easier.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I bought two of these thinking, &quot;What a wonderful timesaver&quot;.  But after they were washed a few times, I started noticing that they had started leaking through and moisture was getting on the crib sheet, which meant I ended up changing the crib sheet anyhow. So I am pretty disappointed in the product; my baby is only 3 months old so these really haven\'t been used that long.  I followed the washing/drying directions but apparently unless these things are handwashed and line dried (and who has time for that w/ a young baby), the lower layer of vinyl doesn\'t hold up.Also, on one of them, the snaps that hold the sheet to the crib have never worked right and never stay.  I wished I hadn\'t wasted the money on these.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven\'t used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I saw the postings on the dangers of this product, but I just love it! We do have one on our crib, but we really only use the crib for playtime. We also keep one on the pack n play\'s bassinet feature and our cosleeper. They\'re easy maintenance and comfy! If you provide lots of supervision for your child, I really don\'t see any danger. I will continue to enjoy their benefits!",5

I wish they would have worked!",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple.  Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore!  I started using these and haven\'t had to change the cute sheet since.  It\'s so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else.  It\'s a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through.  I\'ve changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby\'s normal laundry too!  I highly recommend these sheets.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have been using these for my son for ten months. It was a huge pain to change his crib sheet as it fits so tightly on the mattress.  With these, I just unsnap the 8 straps connecting the crib sheet to the crib.  I can take the dirty one off and put a clean one on in two minutes or less.  I have two of these, and I am so grateful that I have them!When washing, be sure to take the two removeable straps (one at the top and one at the bottom) off the sheet, and snap closed the six straps that are sewn to the sheet.  That way the straps will not tear in the wash.  I wash them normally in the washer and dry them in the dryer.  I have had no trouble whatsoever with these sheets.  I plan to buy these for everyone I know for their baby shower gifts.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I love this product!  It\'s such a pain to change the crib sheet and take off the bumper pads, but with this product you just change this and you\'re done.  It attaches with snaps so you don\'t have to worry about SIDS.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We have used Ultimate Crib sheets since the beginning with our 9 month old twins.  They were a huge time saver and we have recommended them to other parents.  This morning I found one of our girls ""pinned"" under a corner of the sheet nearly suffocating.  She had managed to get her head under the corner and the tension on the snap trapped her head under the sheet facing the rubber bottom.  She is ok, but needless to say we have removed our Ultimate Crib sheets and will not be using them any longer.  Please be careful and don\'t let this happen to you!!!",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We have used several of these with our children in the crib. They are nice because one only has to change the top layer rather than trying to re-make the entire crib in the wee hours of the night after a diaper has &#34;lost containment.&#34; We keep several of them on the crib at once so we can unsnap the one, throw it in the hamper, and go back to bed.Unfortunately, there are some durability issues. The waterproof lining on the underside will not last forever. We always wash it in the machine on the gentle cycle and then hang them to dry (we are afraid of the heat of the dryer destroying the waterproof lining). We still have the compromised sheets as the &#34;emergency layer,&#34; but don\'t trust they would hold a leak for very long. The plastic snaps on the tie-downs also break off with time, leaving fewer points to hold the sheet down.Even with the durability issues, this is the best product we have found for protecting both the crib mattress and some semblance of sleep for the parents when there is a mess.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I agree with the other mom\'s this item is so wonderful and very easy to use..But I have to also agree that they are somewhat disposable,when you wash them the snaps fall off.....This is a lot cheaper than what I paid for them, I bought mine at babies r us and spent 20 a piece on them....",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We originally gave this a negative review but I can positively review it for the specific purpose of using it as a urine-resistant layer UNDER a top sheet.  We have the Clouds and Stars zip-up sheets (which I have loved for years) and use the Ultimate Crib Sheet under the zip-up sheet, so when our child would have an accident we would unzip the zip-up sheet and pull off the top and Ultimate sheets and wash both.  It\'s protected our mattresses over the years.  I wouldn\'t use it as a top sheet since it seemed that the sheet could easily be bunched up or pulled off by a strong baby, and I\'d be concerned about suffocation hazards if a baby wiggles their way underneath, or a choking hazard (if a baby pulls off one of the two end pieces, which go around the crib bars at either end of the crib, and which could fully snap off).  But for this limited use, we used it happily for years.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have loved having these crib sheets!  I only have to use one regular sheet, and then this goes over the top.  When it needs to be changed, a few snaps does the trick and off it comes.  Otherwise I\'d have to have a mattress pad, a waterproof pad, and a regular sheet, and all three would have to come off for each change.  With the thick mattress on the crib, changing them would be a real chore.  The Ultimate Crib Sheet saves time and money.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This is truly an ""all-in-one"" crib sheet! It\'s absorbent, soft, and fairly easy to get on and off. It also covers the entire crib - much better than those itsy-bitsy ""leak guards"" we got that only cover about one square foot!The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that not all the snaps stayed snapped. The elastic-snap thingies (that allow you to secure it to the crib) started to wear out before the crib sheet - one was always coming unsnapped - so I ended up just leaving one unsnapped.All in all, however, this is a great buy. I recommend getting 2 so you always have one handy.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old (2002-2004 isn). Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft. Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product. I wouldn\'t sleep on this so will not use it for my son\'s crib. As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says...but I\'ll never know since I\'m returning it.,2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This product is great in that you do not have to tear apart allbedding/mattress to change the sheet. Makes life easier when you already have too much to do.  The back of the sheets have cracked and started peeling after about 1- 1 1/2 yr of use.My biggest concern, however, is my son was able to pull off the snaps that secure the mattress to the crib. He started this at around 1 1/2yrs. This appears to me to be a huge choking hazard!!",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you\'ll have to try another brand.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This crib sheet is a must have.  There\'s no constant changing of the regular crib sheets which are a pain change.  Just pop this one off and throw it in the washing machine.  It\'s also portable.  You can put it underneath your baby no matter where he is sleeping.  Pregnant?  Worried that your water will break in bed and soak your sheets and mattress?  Just lay the crib sheet on top of or under your fitted sheet and your worries are over.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This product was exactly what I needed. I could not find one locally & my only choice was to drive to another, larger town.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love this.If you want something easy, ( what mom doesn\'t?! ) I suggest getting these.They are waterproof, and so easy to change- I honestly don\'t know what I would do without them!Just make sure to register for at least 3-- one for in the wash, on for in the crib, and one for when the baby decides to ""dribble "" in the crib!ENJOY!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I, unfortunately, bought a non-standardized crib (I didn\'t know it at the time). I couldn\'t find sheets in the store and could only order them from the manufacturer of the crib (at a decent price). I found these and they\'re great because I can snap them into place and although the top and bottom of the mattress is exposed, it\'s no different than if I had shrunk it in the dryer.Speaking of shrinking, they do shrink A LOT, even on low heat. However, the efficience of just having to change this sheet by unsnapping it and putting the spare on saves an unimaginable amount of time and energy. You should at least try one once.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We bought two of these shortly before our son was born, and I could not be happier.  I purchase them on Amazon because they were cheaper than where we registered (I think they were on sale at the time).  He is now 11 months old and we have been using these ever since he was transitioned to his crib at around 3-4 months old.  They are incredible time savers!  They snap on easily and quickly, they are really easy to take off (just pull it off), wash up wonderfully in the washing machine, can go in dryer no problem, and are actually very soft fabric.  They are waterproof but don\'t feel rubbery or like plastic on the side the baby sleeps on.  Our son loves them so much, he actually won\'t sleep in his crib until we have one on.  He has peed, pooped, and vomited on these things and they still look and feel great after over 7 months of use.  We have never had the problem of him getting stuck underneath it.  It stretches tight enough to the slats on his crib that he can\'t get it off the mattress.  The best part is the same as everyone else said, you don\'t have to change the cute sheets underneath it, so you don\'t have to worry about taking off the bumpers, lifting the mattress, etc. for those middle of the night messes.  Just snap off, snap on!  Also, having the Ultimate Crib Sheet be a plain solid color is a really good idea.  My son gets too distracted by the little figures on his regular sheets and spends time trying to pick them off his sheets instead of going to sleep.As everyone else has said, if you are going to get this product, I would definitely buy two so you have an extra that can go on the bed while the other is in the laundry.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really do like the idea of this crib sheet. The only problem is that I have a very thick convertible crib (crib, toddler, full bed) and the corners are too big for the staps to secure to the snap. For now the sheet is secured to the slat beside the corner leaving about an inch of space not covered by the sheet...no biggy, worth it for the convenience. I plan to eventually replace the elastic closures with longer elastic pieces for a perfect fit.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Yes i have pretty sheets on the crib......but who wants to wash them every time there is a mess.  Well this is the answer!  So much easier (since they snap around the crib slats) to get on and off!  Waterproof!!  What else should i say!  Perfect gift!!!,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I measured the crib before purchasing this, but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib. Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed, so they just hung thee. It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When I bought these two years ago for my daughter, they were the best sheets!  Thickly padded and washed and dried like a dream.  I still have them and use then regularly.  THEN, when my son came along this year, I got two more.  WHAT JUNK!  They are now less than half as thick and after only one washing the vinyl backing is all wrinkled.  DON\'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, they won\'t last a month of washing.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Can\'t imagine life without this!  It\'s my favorite thing besides his favorite blankie.  I got two Ultimate Crib Sheets when my son was born.  He\'s now 18 mths and they are still going strong, although they have started showing some wear underneath.  Mine are a bit short on the ends, but it doesn\'t bother me or him.  I recently changed the sheet on his bed, but don\'t think I\'ve done so for about six months.  It doesn\'t really get dirty unless you have some serious overnight leaking, which we recently have had (obviously time to size up his diapers).  Changing the sheet means taking the bumper most of the way off and the mattress out of the crib.  I certainly don\'t have time for that on a weekly basis and you won\'t either.  Make sure and get a couple!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have 4 daughters and was greatful for this crib sheet.  I had purchased 1 over the telephone several years ago from an ad.  After I received it, I called and purchased 3 more.  My kids are a little older now and no longer in baby beds, but I still use them when they are sick by placing them under their pillows.  It still saves me from changing sheets all of the time.  I have purchased a sheet for everyone I know having a baby for the past 5 years and they all end up buying more of them. THIS IS THE BEST IDEA FOR A CRIB SHEET THAT WAS EVER INVENTED!!!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Received this sheet and after I felt the scratchy material I started reading all the reviews on this and realized I made a good decision by sending it back! It sounds like this thing is a death trap! Many moms find their babies underneath the pad suffocating! So glad I sent it back before having to learn the hard way.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful.  However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs.  The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these.",2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",The Ultimate Crib Sheet is the ultimate gift for both baby and mom. No more wrestling with a fitted crib sheet. Just lay the Ultimate Crib Sheet over the pretty fitted sheet that matches the bedding and snap it in place. In less than a minute a new sheet is in place and the crib didn\'t have to be moved and mom didn\'t get frustrated trying to keep the sheet around the matress while the bumper pads kept pushing it off. It\'s perfect for those middle-of-the-night sheet changes and it can even be put on one-handed. A must for all moms!,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Our newborn baby boy has been having a ball spraying us every time we change him. Thank goodness we bought these crib sheets! I can\'t see the sheets underneath really well, since it covers the entire top of it, but it keeps it clean and dry. The top is soft, while the bottom is lined with plastic.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This sheet is such a smart purchase.  Yes, it may be fun to get all of the adorable printed sheets, but this is so much better.  When you have to change sheets in the middle of the night, it is SO much better to simply unsnap and snap this sheet rather than lifting up the cumbersome mattress to get a regular sheet on it.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I received 2 of these sheets as a gift after my daughter was born.  I already had several sheets and didn\'t think I would use these...then I tried them.  I can\'t say enough great things about this product.  It is so easy to change the bedding now.  No more lifting up that huge mattress.  Make sure and have 2 of them-so that you can have one clean at all times.  It takes me less than 3 minutes to change the sheets.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This item posses a chocking hazzard. I woke up to my 6 month old gagging on the elastic strap that holds the sheet to the crib. While it may seem like a wonderful invention (oh how i miss it!) I don\'t think it\'s worth the risk.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn\'t appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn\'t seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We\'ll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.,4
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,"I purchased 2 of these for use on my son\'s twin size mattress.  They are wonderful!  They contain everything, wash up beautifully and have drastically decreased the amount of laundry that I have to do.  The full size pads are actually the perfect size for a twin mattress in my opinion.  I was worried that the twin size pads would be too small, and I\'m glad I went with the full size.Update 01/31/2009:  We\'ve owned these pads for a little over a year now, and they\'ve been great!  With washing 2-4 times per week, both pads are now starting to leak through to the mattress below because the waterproof shielding is starting to develop little cracks and pinholes here and there, so it\'s now time to replace them.",5
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,I was looking for a nightime waterproof pad for an elderly person.  After looking through what Amazon offered I choose this one and have been pleased with it.  It does a terrific job in absorbing and keeping the bed dry.  It is also very soft and comfortable.Its not as large as the picture would indicate.  Take the measurements given seriously.This is an excellent value.  Recommended.,5
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,"I bought a full size pad for my son\'s twin bed, and we are able to use it in other sizes of beds too.  It is not too bulky and it is nice for traveling.  Since my son has not had any accident yet, I don\'t know how well it absorbs.",3
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,"While my 4 yr old had been potty trained since she was about 2-1/2, she wasn\'t making it thru the night & so we used Pull Up every night. Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups.  We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn\'t a fluke & then invested in *two* of these pads.  The tuck in feature on both sides is great & I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep.  She finds it comfortable as she\'s never complained about it (of course, Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups & sleeping in regular underwear).  The best part about this design is that if there is an accident, you just whip it off (and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet) and tuck in a dry one.  No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night.  For us, if the top sheet or blanket gets wet, I\'ve got a second comforter/blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her. (of course pajama changing can\'t be avoided) That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible.  I\'ve washed them a number of times & they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time (follow washing instructions). The size is also generous.  I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night, but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night, we\'ve never had a problem.  It says it absorbs 6 cups; while we haven\'t tested that, I\'ve never found the pad dripping, so all the urine was securely soaked in.  We haven\'t found a down side to these pads.  Even the price isn\'t bad-- I did some price comparison and maybe you\'ll find them a few bucks less, but not by much.  And, if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2-cents, my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier, but I was in no mood to change sheets (or these pads) *every* night.  I\'ve read that most toddlers\' bladders aren\'t large enough to make it thru the night anyway, so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally. In that way, everyone was happy (well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy-- everyone\'s happy!)  Thus, I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no-more-Pull-Ups Road.  I am sure it would be just as useful for any older child (and parents) dealing with bed-wetting problem.",5
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,I got this for my three-year-old daughter to use at night since she still has night time accidents.  It works fabulous!  Super absorbant.  Makes my life so much easier!  I bought two in the beginning and now I\'m buying two more.,5
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",Great Product ... Highly Recommend! No more changing crib and toddler bed sheets in the middle of the night!,5

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;","It does the job of protecting the mattress, the flaps for tucking under the bed come out a lot though. Not sure if it\'s worth the hassle of having them.  My daughter tends to be a wiggle worm though.  I suppose without them the pad might not be remotely in the right spot in the morning though. We bought two for a twin bed since she is all over the bed during the course of an evening and I wanted to make sure we were covered. 1 would work for a toddler/crib sized mattress, if you have a twin you will probably want 2.",4

This pad is a great item, it\'s soft on the top so my son doesnt mind sleeping on it and it really works keeping the sheets dry. My son sleeps all over the place and it\'s plenty wide enough to give the coverage we need. And it\'s never leaked through. The only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars was that it\'s tough to tuck the far side in when you have the bed up against the wall like we do. I\'m not sure how they could make this better, but they should work on figuring out a way. ;) I only wish I\'d gotten 2!!",4
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",This is my second one and it works like a charm. Just don\'t put it in the dryer on high setting or the backing will start to come apart and the waterproofness is no longer.,5

He is adorable and fun to have around during the day and besides house training him, he\'s pretty easy to take care of. I could get him to a puppy pad or outside during the day but at night he would go without waking me up and then go back to sleep since he was so young. I got very tired of cleaning pee off my mattress and constantly washing my blankets but I didn\'t want to spend a ton of money on a full cover since I sleep on a full size mattress. This small cover was a good price and big enough to cover the area where he always goes. I do wish it was bigger but it works very well. I would definitely recommended it.",4

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",I bought two pads for my toddler and have been using them for a year. They work fine and save her mattress from many bed wets. However the surface area of the pad is not very big and my toddler likes to turn and flip around when sleeping. Hence we put two pads on the bed and that solves the problem. My only complaint is the folding area could be longer. My toddler\'s mattress was very thick and the pads would shift position as the cloth that is folded underneath the mattress is very little.,4

Basic Comfort EZ Changing Pad,"I put this on my baby registry for my first born. After having her home from the hospital for a month, I became very unhappy with this changing pad. My baby had very loose stools (from a strictly breast milk diet) and she soiled this pad close to every changing. I kept having to wash the cover. My girl friend recommended to me another changing pad on the babiesrus website called the ""Contoured Changing Pad"" that has a permanent plastic cover on it (that allows for a wipe clean surface).  I got one and found it to be worlds better than the E-Z pad. In fact I now have two of them, one for upstairs and one for down.",1
Basic Comfort EZ Changing Pad,"I got this pad as a baby shower gift and I think it is just fine. I\'ve never used the velcro straps to strap down my baby, I think you can do without those. I had a changing table given to me and this just fit right in it perfectly. I also got terry cloth changing pad covers with this gift and they fit nicely. Then I put one of those waterproof flannel pads down underneath the terry cloth cover and a smaller one on top of the cover where the baby\'s bottom goes. I wash the terry cloth cover once a week and don\'t need to do much more because if he pees or poops in the middle of a change I\'ve got the waterproof pad on top as a back up and just change that out.As a newborn though, when I would put him on the changing table, his legs and arms would flail out and he felt like he was falling and he\'d scream. At my mom\'s house she has a different changing table that has more of a dip to it where he lays and he never did that there-guess he feels more secure that way and can feel the sides of the pad and table hugging him. That would be the only downfall is that it needs to have more of a dip to it. Other than that, it\'s a great pad-nice and comfy and I like the cover that comes with it, but I\'ve always got other layers on top so I never really see it.",5

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I bought this diaper pail because the store had run out of the Fisher Price pail I had originally intended to buy. Boy was I sorry!! Aside from the fact that the diaper pail fell apart into many little pieces every time I went to change the bag, It did not contain the quite pungent odor that accompanies dirty diapers.While this diaper pail was cheaper than the Diaper Genie, I found it to be a complete waste of my hard earned money, as it doesn\'t even serve well as a basic trash can.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two\'s worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it\'s smell so that you can maintain freshness. It\'s easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive.,5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"We bought this pail for our first son.  It was easy to use and easy to load new bags.  It was also great that it just used regular kitchen trash bags.  However, it did not contain the smell of diapers hardly at all.  You could walk into his room and smell the diaper pail.  Would recommend trying a different type.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I liked the idea of this pail using regular kitchen trash bags, however, it is a pain to change the bag.  Also, it is not odor-less.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I was using the diaper genie and I wasn\'t at all impressed. I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $14. I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won\'t go back.It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full.But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy!",4
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.I would not recommend this product.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,I babysit 8-12 kids usually a day and 2-4 of them are in diapers and this product is real easy because i can keep it anywhere without it stinking everything up and it is easy to dispose of the bags. It is just like a garbage can you would keep in the kitchen or in a bathroom but it really keeps away the odor and it is great cause it is quick and easy jus tbny hitting the button and closing it. Very simply to do while holding a 4 mth old and a 22 mth old,5

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,Thanks to this wonderful diaper pail I never have to smell dirty diapers! The other wonderful part is you can use regular trash bags( I buy the drawstring so I never catch a whiff of the contents) instead of pricey refills!! I highly recommend this product!,5

It stinks--even with only one smelly diaper in it.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I\'ve found that the Odor-Less Diaper Pail is nowhere near odorless!!  It was okay when our baby was still making the non-smelly diapers, but FORGET IT once your kid is on solids.  My husband empties that pail every few days (then sprays the inside with Lysol) when it\'s only filled with pee pee diapers.  And it is ready to be emptied by then, because it reeks of urine.  Don\'t even think about keeping poopy diapers in there!!  We have to dump poop, from a soiled diaper, in the toilet and just throw away the diaper because the Odor-Less Diaper Pail DOES NOT contain the smell.  Buyer BEWARE!

Also the first time I changed the bag, the springs broke under the top.  I still use it because it\'s the only thing I have, but I would not reccommend this to anyone.

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I purchased this diaper pail for my son and let me tell you it was more work keeping up this pail then it was caring for a newborn.  We purchased this product because there were no special bags to buy and it had an area to place deoderizer tablets.  Well the spring popped off every time we put a diaper in it which left a space for the smell to come out. It was nasty.  We had to constantly fix the springs just so it was close up each time.  The pail stunk so bad even with the tablets and an air freshener in the bottom of the bucket.  It was so bad, we soaked it and washed it and it still stunk. We ended up throwing it in the dumpster. It was just horrible. Not a good product and poorly made.",2

I registered for another one for baby #2.",4
Cord \'Shortner,"I love these cord shorteners. I have 11 month old twins and have bought several of these to put in the areas they play in. I have also used them in my own bedroom, even though the twins are never in there. One of these wraps my electric toothbrush cord up nice and neat so it isn\'t taking up all of the sink. It wraps up two thin cords together or 1 thick cord by itself.This product has made having twins a lot easier. It is durable and comes with sticky stuff to adhere it to the wall, although removal of it will mean patching up and repainting. I never stick it to the wall, but it does a great job and hiding all the cords we have around the house. The kids are no longer interested in the plugs when these things are in place. And if I decide I need to move and item, it easily comes apart with a push of the center.",5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"What a pain! My daughter could open them no problem, luckily because it was so easy she wasn\'t interested in it. You have to take them off to use the broiler. Like another reviewer said, it\'s easier just to remove your knobs...don\'t waste your money.",1

Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,My daughter can no longer get to the stove knobs. Everyone is happy about that! They do exactly what they say they do. Good value.,5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"First off, these may not fit everyone\'s range. They are designed to fit a wide variety of standard-sized knobs, but may not work for you. Yes, you must remove your knobs to get these covers on initially, but if they fit, they definitely work. Yes, you must open the cover to turn your knob, but remember, these are safety devices, not convenience devices.That said, they worked on my GE Profile range, thankfully. From what I could tell, most of the GE ranges use the same knob types, so if you\'ve got a GE, I believe these covers will fit.I had kept these (and a few other knob covers) on my wish list until my daughter learn it!  We prefer the ""Tinkle Toons"" potty with a moisture sensor.  the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work!",1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,This potty was given to us by my mom who wanted to encourage our daughter.  It had the exact opposite effect.  The first time that she ever told us she had to use the potty she sat on this potty the music started and she cried.  She wouldn\'t sit on another potty because she was scared! I have talked to other moms who have had similar experiences.,1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"We got this potty for my daughter a few months ago.  I personally thought it would be cute, seeing that she LOVES music.  I thought it would be great for her and help with the pricess.The sensor NEVER works!  It never plays music when she uses the potty.  It does work however in the middle of the night when we are all sleeping.  Kind of scary.Also, the plastic is very hard and can be very cold on  a litlte ones bottom early in the morning or late in the evening.  This making the potty training VERY hard.  My daughter never wanted to sit there long enough to go to the bathroom.I wouldn\'t buy this product if you have a new potty trainee.  It\'s just not worth the money.Buy one that is simple and has some padding to the seat area.GOOD LUCK!",2
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"Seemed like a good motivator at the time we bought it. However, after the first couple of days, the batteries were removed. Every time you bump it, the music goes off. It\'s too cute, my 3 year old daughter thinks it\'s more of a toy than a functioning potty. She has yet to actually do anything on it. It gets more use as a chair or a pretend potty for her bear/doll menagerie. I also wish it had a lid on it. It sits between the toilet and the sink (the only place in our small bathroom that we can put it), and we\'re always knocking things off the sink into it, or kicking it (which is why we took the batteries out). There are more sensible options out there.",2
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,I had went and bought the royal potty for my son becasue it looked real cool. the first time he used it the legs fell off. every time he sits the right legs pop off. when he goes #1 the hole is so tiny when he sits down the pee just dont make it in the hole. and the music i put batteries in and it just would not quit making music it is the worse potty ever. ADVICE. DONT BUY THIS POTTY IT REALLY IS A WASTE OF MONEY,1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"so gross.  I bought this b/c several family members and lots of family friends work for Fisher Price.  Not sure who designed it, but every time my son pees in it, it leaks all over the floor.  And we do use the little pee deflector thing (for boys).  Maybe it works for girls?  And the little musical part has only worked maybe 2x and it freaked my son out.  It looks very cute, but I\'m tired of cleaning up a puddle of pee every time.  We\'re switching to little seat that goes on the real potty.",2
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,This was the worst potty ever. I bought it for my 2 year old son cause it looked different & it looked like it would be more fun but its the worst.  Everytime he pees it leakes!!!  I ended up getting a new one cause I thought there was something wrong with it but the new one also leakes.  Plus the music is the worst.  Every time you walk near the bathroom it goes off & the stupid red light stayes on which means the batteries keep dying. I thought Fisher Price was a good company?,1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"As others have complained the sounds on this potty do not work correctly and they go off for no reason at odd times (like in the middle of the night).  It leaks terribly!  My son tries to go, but gets discouraged when his pee-pee is in the potty AND all over the floor.  I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this potty.  What a waist of money!!!",1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"My 20 month old daughter loves this potty. She has been going on it since she was 9 months old. 3 Complaints about it though..(1) it doesnt seem very comfortable,(2) The music is annoying and distracts my daughter when she is trying to pee, (so i remved the batteries)(3) This is the worst one. It leaks like crazy. I made it my mission to find out why. It has nothing to do with the bowl being placed in correctly. It has to do with the tiny gap between the bottom of the hole in the seat and the actual bowl. The pee runs down my daughters leg/butt towards the back or side and runs under the seat and in between the seat and bowl so it leaks out. So for all you people with leaks this is the reason as i spent so much time figuering out the problem.",2
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"We have had this potty probably 9 months now.  When we first got it, it worked perfectly, music played when it was supposed to etc.  Now as my 2 year old is getting more serious about potty training the music won\'t work when it is supposed to, it leaks on the floor even though the shield is in place and he has tucked himself.  I took it apart, cleaned it, and reassembled, and it still leaks.",1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"I was given this potty seat for my daughter (now age 2 1/2).  At first glance it seems cute and makes ""reward"" noises and even comes with a story.  First, the story was kind of dumb in my opinion and there are much better potty books out there, but that is a side issue. My real pet peeves with this potty are:  1.  It leaks big time, and I have a girl so it\'s not because she sprays like little boys might.  About 1/2 the time I had to clean up around the potty after my dd used it, and I had the bowl in correctly!  (As if we don\'t have to clean up enough potty/accidents in potty training!!)  2.  The music is supposed to be a reinforcement, but my dd quickly realized that her hand could also activate the sensor, so here she would sit putting her hands down in the potty to make the music play!  I took those batteries out real quick . . .Anyhow, we are now using the $1 garage sale potty that I got as an ""extra"" and the royal potty is in the closet!",2
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"This chair design is not for potty training toddlers. If you have a boy be prepared for a big mess. While potty training my grandson this chair was a ""Royal Pain"". First of all the child can not sit on the toilet by himself, he needs to be lifted onto the seat, and make sure that stay by the child and hold down his wee wee or there will be pee pee every where as the splash guard is inadequate to say the least.",1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"This potty chair LEAKS VERY BADLY!!!!! Pee gets on the floor EVERY stinkin\' time AND on my son\'s feet. The opening is WAY to small to go number 2 in. It is very messy business to clean up afterwards. I am VERY disappointed with it. Buy this ONLY if you want to waste your money. Plus, the sensors for the music are WAY to sensitive and go off when no one is even in the room! Ugh. :(",1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,I am glad to know it is not just my child!  This potty leaks just about everytime he uses it!  The battery died very quickly and the sounds were always sporadic at best.  I would DEFINITELY discourage anyone from buying this potty. It is hindering the potty training due to the fact that my son get\'s upset when it leaks all over his leg!  I plan on trashing mine and finding a good replacement.,1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,I really disliked this product. It leaked out between the potty and the bowl. It is also very difficult to clean. I noticed an odor from it one day so I started looking and found a lot of crevices that are impossible to get clean. I called Fisher-Price and they were very nice and sent me coupons for the amount I paid for it. I replaced it with an inexpensive potty without the musical feature.,2
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"Ok, I am using this for a little girl, so I didn\'t notice the leaking that others who have boys noticed...but my daughter has a different problem with this toilet. First off...the potty is supposed to make a &quot;royal song&quot; when the child pees....but it makes the royal sound as soon as the child sits on the potty so it isn\'t any special reward.  Second, my daughter is more interested in playing with the very bright red light inside the toilet instead of sitting on it.  She will sit there and play with the light and get it to make music and all potty training goes right out the window...Just what I want -- to teach my daughter to stick her hands in the toilet! It is just a really bad product -- and a bad idea.  Buy yourself a simple potty that costs less because this one is not worth the extra money.",1
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,These are woderful toys! I looked at lots of toys before deciding it was easier to just buy this pack. Now my son plays with the box more than the toys! Go figure. :-),5
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,"I recieved this as a shower gift.  My daughter, now 11 months, has gotten lots of use from all the toys from birth.  There\'s a good selection of teethers, toys that make noise, and soft toys.  This box provides lots of fun.  Babies of all ages will enjoy the toys and there\'s enough to rotate so baby doesn\'t get bored!",5
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,"I read all the reviews for this set of toys and looked very carefully at the pictures online, which is why I decided to include it in my baby registry. However, when we did finally get the toy it was truly disappointing because half the things that they show in the pictures were not actually there. The duckie was replaced with a very crude pig which is far from the cute piggy that comes to a readers mind. And the hippo and octopus are just not there. All the toys including the teething rings were very low quality and the plastic seemed dirty and out-of-shape. Infact, as I was looking over everything, the recurring thought in my mind was: I will probably have to incinerate these toys just to sterilize them. And to top it all off, I realized that we truly did not get our money\'s worth because I know for a fact that for 40 bucks (which is what this play set is worth) we could get really good stuff from other companies like Lamaze etc which are made with alot more care and thought to the baby\'s development and play.All in all, we felt truly deceived by this company Sassy because firstly they did not honestly display all the toys that they actually include in the box and secondly, for the kind of crap they sent, they are over charging the consumers like crazy. I don\'t think this toy even deserves one star but they don\'t have a rating lower than that, unfortunately.",1
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,"Seems like all the toys are so similar - my children didn\'t really seem to get much out of them - kind a ""seen one, seen \'em all"" situation.  The keys that came in our set were nice as wase the jingle ball.  The teething toys were ok, but basic teethers are simpler and seem to fit in our kids mouths better.  It costs quite a bit and gives you lots of quantity - but not sure if infants really care all that much.  Investing in a few (different) sensory toys seemed to work better for us...",3
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,"I would call this box of toys mediocre here\'s the good and the bad.Good:1. My son\'s favorite toys came from this box.  Even now at 7 months, he loves the teething bird, the rattle and the pig that came instead of the ducky.2. Thank goodness for the letters! Not only were they fun-textured, but we used them to hang the toys on his play gym lower.3. Several of the toys have been pretty well abused and show no signs of wear.4.It\'s a nice variety of easy-to-throw-in-the-diaper-bag toys - small enough he can carry them with him into the carseat.Bad:1. Definitely did not get all the toys in the picture, no ducks, no octopus, and didn\'t get the thing in the picture with what looks like 3 stuffed cubes.  We did get a stuffed pig on wheels that is not in the picture, and one rattle instead of one of the ones in the picture, but it\'s definitely less overall.2. The letters came in handy, but really aren\'t fun toys.It\'s probably not worth $39.99 - I got it as a gift and would say it\'s worth $19.99 - so maybe pick it up if you can find in on sale.",3
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,"I don\'t have this whole set - I only have a pack with the alphabet letters - but I just want to say that we love them! My 6 week old is finally able to start holding onto toys and these alphabet rings are the best! He can\'t pick them up himself yet but we put them in his hand and he will hang onto them, wave them around, suck on them, and throw them. It is adorable! They are also letters of the alphabet so we spell out words for him and show him all the letters, so these are educational, too! You can also hook them onto anything - his gymini, carseat, etc. These are the best! :)",5
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,"Instead of buying these items sperately over time, save yourself the money and buy this box (or add it to your baby shower gift list). I purchased these for my son when he was a few months old, he is now 10 months old and he is still enjoying them. They are bright, attractive and easy to play with. They are small enough to throw a couple into a nappy bag (sorry, diaper bag) without creating bulk. They are really handy for distracting your little one whilst you are on the go (in the car, shopping, etc.)and some are even bath friendly.",4
Sassy Baby\'s First Toys,"I am happy with the total package.  There are a number of things that go with the various stages of our baby\'s development, and overall I beleive the price works out more economical than purchasing individual toys.",4
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,Do you have a jogging stroller with front &amp; back seats rather than side by side?,5
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"It is easy to handle.  We live in Florida and the heat here can be very intense, but with this wonderful jogger for two it makes it easy to take the boys for a jog or walk and they are very well protected with the wonderful canopy and easy clear window on top of canopy that we can check on them as we roll.  The best part is the easy adjustment of each seat. One can sleep, while the other catches all the action.  The best investment I have made for my grandchildren right now.  Thank you!",5
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"This was the first double stroller that I found that I both liked and could afford. I read all the reveiws from this site as well as those on [...]and some others. They were mixed. I have never owned a double before so the weight suprised me, but its nothing I couldnt lift. It is easy to put together, but when I folded it the snaps connecting the material to the foot plate came undone, and it was hard trying to get all of them to snap in place the first time.It fits in and out of my front door. I took my oldest son up and down the street, without my youngest and it steered fine with only 1 child. It is extremely easy to push, hard to turn, I do not recommend taking it into the malls. I plan on going on the trails by the lake as soon as I get over being sick. My son is 29 months old and 3 feet tall. ( he weighs 33lbs.) His head touches the canopy and goes half way over the top of the seat. The canopy is kind of saggy in the middle where the kids heads go. I am thinking that I could rig up something so that it doesnt touch his head. I dont know how much longer he will be able to ride in it, which sucks cause I spent so much money on it.I have not taken it off roads yet so I have no comment on that. If you have twins or kids younger than 2 it will probably work good for you and you will be able to get some good use out of it. Foot plate had a bunch of dents and scratches on it and there is a black stain, maybe grease, on one of the seats. The seats are not easily reclined, I would not want to try it when one of them are sleeping.",3
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"When you are a mother of twins (or two small children for that matter) you become accustomed to lugging around huge pieces of baby equipment - it\'s part of the job. With that being said, this jogger, by far, is the easiest to cart around - not too heavy, not too many parts and it is nice and sturdy (not to mention that my 6 mo old boys love it!). It\'s great for moms like myself to have - no more excuses on why I can\'t run any more! Handles great - it\'s no different than other joggers so steering can be cumbersome but it\'s a nice smooth ride and as long as you don\'t need to make a series of sharp turns - you\'ll love it!",4
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"It took several weeks for us to receive the stroller (that was because UPS damaged the first one they sent), but when we got it we loved it.  We have a 10 week old and a two year old and they both fit in the stroller fine.  The handle bar does not adjust heights, but it is much higher than other handle bars.  I like the shade that the canopy provides.  We have not yet used the rain cover but we are glad it came with it.  Very smooth ride for the children and easy to push while running or walking!",4
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"I walk an hour a day using my Double Trouble stroller and my toddler and newborn seem to look forward to the walks as much as I do.  I also have a single jogger by Baby Jogger, but I find myself using my double stroller even when I\'m just pushing one.The Tike Tech Double Stroller stands taller than most jogging strollers which is easier to push for those of us who are tall, especially if you\'re on roller blades.  However, the bar is adjustable for those who don\'t need the extra height.Another nice feature is the adjustable seat safety bar which I haven\'t seen on other strollers.  My toddler loves holding onto it.My personal favorite features are the multiple storage compartments and the smooth ride.  This stroller is wonderful for jogging, walking, exercising, and trips to the beach or zoo.  However, as others have said, it isn\'t ideal for trips to the mall.  If you intend to purchase a stroller for outdoor recreational use, I highly recommend this stroller.",5
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"I have a toddler and newborn, and walk a lot, so I wanted to get a double jogger stroller that would handle the bumps on my neighborhood sidewalks and also other treks.Pros:*Nice and high - perfect for tall people like my husband and me*Seats are straight - with the Expedition stroller, the seats tilt inward and are really weird - my daughter was NOT a fan when we tested it out at the store*Good protection in front/harness is good*Lots of storage space in baskets, and lots of little pockets on canopyCons:*Not a swiveling stroller! This is my BIGGEST beef with the stroller, and, frankly, with the selection at Babies R Us. I\'ve seen double joggers that swivel on other websites (Schwinn makes a great one), but since I was buying this with gift cards, I was limited to the TWO that Babies R Us carries. A single stroller that doesn\'t swivel is one thing, but when you double the weight it makes steering even more difficult! I had my daughter and niece in it, and together they weigh about 80lbs, and it wasn\'t much fun to pop the front wheel up in order to turn! I guess if you\'re walking mostly straightaways that isn\'t much of a problem, but it\'s really very annoying. Almost to the point where I have considered returning it...but again, there\'s the issue of this being the best I can get off of the BRU website.*Seat Height - my daugther is only 2.5, and although she\'s tall for her age, her head hits the canopy when it\'s down!*The seat is open at the back when reclined - I read other reviews that mentioned this and didn\'t realize how bad it was until I saw it for myself. A child really can, pretty easily, climb out the back of the stroller. And it doesn\'t take them very long to figure out that it\'s really fun to flip over and stick their heads out the back.If I had to do it over again, and didn\'t have to use gift cards for this purchase, I would definitely have gone with the Schwinn Safari double stroller. It\'s less expensive and a much easier stroller to maneuver (I tried out my friend\'s so I know this first-hand).",3
"Battat Mirror Pound-A-Ball Toy, Colors May Vary","This toy is awesome for all ages. I got it for my first son when he was 18 months and he still plays with it at 3 1/2! The only bad thing about this toy is that I have been unable to find replacement balls. It only comes with 4 balls and we have lost a couple of them. Other than that, it\'s a great toy.",4
"Battat Mirror Pound-A-Ball Toy, Colors May Vary","My son has CP and this is one of his favorite toys. We\'ve had it for about a year and he never gets tired of it. He plays with it almost everyday. It\'s great for CP kids, teaches them to use tools (the hammer) and they can play with one or both hands.",5
"Battat Mirror Pound-A-Ball Toy, Colors May Vary","My son received this as a gift, otherwise I would have chucked it out the window the 100th time he got his hand or binky stuck in it. As other parents have noted, kids like putting all kinds of things in this toy, not just the balls. I reached my wits end with this thing when my boy put a dozen crayons into this thing, then started crying  to get them out. Of course they\'d all gotten worked down into the middle of the thing, and I literally had to get a  set of tweezers/tongs to try to extract them.  If I had realized how many crying tantrums this thing was going to cause, I would have quickly shoved it aside in a closet & brought it out only when the person who gave it to us came over.Give this one a pass, check out other models. There are better designed ones out there that promote the same skills. If I had to do it over again, I\'d get one of the Plan Toys pound-a-ball, specifically the Miracle Pounding toy, where the balls stay IN the toy, and don\'t roll under the chair, couch, etc. and there isn\'t any room for other things to get permanently stuck!",1
"Battat Mirror Pound-A-Ball Toy, Colors May Vary","We bought this when our son was 16-months old; he\'s now 18-months old and loves it, plays with it all the time!  I do have to keep my eyes on the balls because they can get lost easy, but it\'s worth it to see him using the hammer and watching him play.",5
Toysmith Battat Ready Set Go Cars Toy,"The cars are the perfect size for little hands and lots of fun.  Very cute, bright colors. They make a little noise to captivate the child, but not enough to annoy the parent.  I love the cars, but I\'m not sure they are worth the price, with shipping they are fairly expensive.  Other than the price they are perfect.",4
Toysmith Battat Ready Set Go Cars Toy,"I previously bought a set in Australia and my Mother-in-law saw how much fun my daughter and son had with the set that we tracked down two more sets (couldn\'t get them in OZ any more) through Amazon.com for her other grandchildren. They are great fun, great for motor skills, soft to handle and very durable.",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","Nothing grosses me out more than watching parents make their child eat off of a table at a restaurant.  Of course, watching a one year old fling their plate across the room is not a much better option.  These mats are an excellent solution.  They are easy to carry around-I would keep a few at a time with me whenever we would go out in case we stopped at a restaurant.  They are easy to use-just peel and stick to the table.  They are clean-no germs from a restaurant table.  They are safe-no plates or bowls to drop or toss.  They are entertaining for the child-what toddler doesn\'t love looking at Sesame Street characters when they eat?  And clean-up is a breeze-just peel off the table and crumple the leftover food and other trash inside the mat.  I was often asked by other patrons where I purchased them.  They were one of the most useful products when my daughters were younger.  The only downside was that my daughters knew to rip them up if they wanted to cause trouble, but if they were in that kind of mood, I shouldn\'t have had them at a restaurant in the first place.",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","These things are great.There are two strips of sticky stuff that holds these place mats down to the table. They are sticky enough that it takes some time to work the place mat off of the table if your child tries. Yet they do not ruin any furniture.The mats are very useful for a variety of purposes and places. We have used ours to protect our table when painting. WE use them all the time when we are eating out. THis is very good for the young finger feeding child. You can put small bits of food right in front of him and not worry about a plate getting broken because the child threw it on the floor. When you are through eating, you simply roll this up and throw it away. Mess is gone.Excellent. Useful. I carry them in my purse at all times.Well worth every penny.",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","These placemats are such a great idea.  We use them at home, at the park, at restaurants, etc.  They keep the area clean and give the kids something to look at while they are waiting for their food.  Easy clean up too!",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","I am a busser in a very popular, high traffic restaurant and I see quite a bit of parents use the things. i have to say, nothing frustrates me more than trying to remove these things from the table top. I know this just sounds like an aggravated rant, but over half of the tables at the restaurant have one or more square residue outlines left from the sticky side of these place-mats. These marks aren\'t only frustrating for the restaurant staff, but are also unsightly for the guests of the restaurant. I know that this review wont matter to most who read it, but please, before you buy this,try to be conscientious of the restaurant and the table you\'re about to ruin.",1
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count",Perfect for every parent whose ever tried to feed a toddler at a fast food restaurant.  No more wrapping paper or trays used as food-filled catapults.  The Table Topper allows baby to eat off the table without the food actually touching the table.  These thin plastic sheets store easily in a diaper bag and adhere right to the table top.  When you\'re done just peel off and throw out the mess.,5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","I purchased these table toppers for eating out with my 5.5 year old, 2 year old, and 7 month old...My toddler and baby would constantly lick the table, or chew on it or something, and they both eat OFF a table, so I was quite concerned... I am NOT a ""germaphobe"", and I rarely wipe down a restaurant highchair unless its filthy, but the table and food is what I think is discusting (would you eat off a restaurant table?)The table topper sticks to the table by two adhesive edges, on the top and bottom. I called the company to ask why its not all the way around (closer to the edges) and they said that would be too costly, and parents would have a difficult time removing the toppers themselves... I still think the prouduct would be GREATLY improved if the WHOLE topper was adhesive, like you tore back a sheet of wax paper and the topper was a big ""sticker"", but there would be a little tab on one corner to help you remove it. Anyway, when your child is done you simply pick up the topper (with the contents), roll it, and dump it!Well for babies, this is a VERY fantastic invention... Well, if you have a baby that touches everything, and is VERY curious, it may not work... My son is too interested in his cup, or his toy to be thinking about the table topper, so it works. He loves to pat his hands on it though, and he also enjoys ""eating"" the topper...My toddler will occasionally ""go for the topper"", but if she becomes bored, she will rip the thing off in seconds... I am trying to get her to actually eat off a plastic plate (we tote around) but she still tips it over and such... She\'s a HUGE Elmo fanatic though, so my reward for her keeping it on, is getting to see Elmo... but yet she STILL removes the thing! I feel like toting around my OWN double sided tape to attatch to the thing, but thats sort of out there...So I guess it really depends on your child, but I would recomend to atleast try the product, because when your child leaves it alone, its truly a fantastic solution! It also fits well in diaper bags or purses.",4
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","If you EVER eat out with your toddler, you need to invest in these mats.  It used to disgust me to see parents wipe off a table at a restaurant and then put their chid\'s food directly on the table.  You don\'t realize how unsanitary that is.  These mats quickly adhere to the table, typically stay put, and provide for clean-up.I deducted a star, because sometimes, just sometimes, I am fumbling so much trying to remove the covers for the adhesive that my child starts getting a little rowdy because he\'s ready for his food.  Also, my son likes to try to pull the placemat off the table.  For the most part, he fails.  But, he\'ll occasionally get a good pull on it and end up knocking something over.But, overall it\'s a great product.",4
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","These are awesome!  I bought them at the store in a smaller package (15 or 20) & they are a must have for young children.  I was always disgusted to let my child eat off of a dirty restaurant table, but if I gave him a plate he\'d just throw the plate on the floor...so these are great.  They may seem kind of expensive, but we don\'t really go out to eat that often...I am still using the same pack 6 months later.  Totally worth it...a must have!",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count",My son also rips these right off the table.  He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older (fortunately I only bought the 20 pack).  This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical.  I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far.Update: I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well.  The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well (pack of 8 for $1) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10.  These wrap around the edge of the table and cover more area than the previously reviewed brand.,2
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","I LOVE these mats! They stick to any table surface (including tablecloths). Not only do they protect my kids from any tables that may not have been cleaned very well, but they also make clean up easy. Kids make a mess when they eat with their fingers. All you have to do is peel it off the table (doesn\'t ruin the surface) and roll up the food in it. Great invention for moms who worry about the cleanliness of restaurant tables. I have someone stop me at every restaurant to ask where to get them.",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","LOVE THEM!! We could not dine out w/o them! Our baby throws plates across the table so this was the best invention ever. They are sanitary, disposable and our baby can\'t rip them off and throw them. They really stick well and cover a large surface area for lots of food. Thank you!!",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count",We love these disposable placemats.  They are easy to carry around and use.  My son loves to point at the characters and objects printed on them.  A variety of designs would make the product even better.,5

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I bought this instead of a Boppy before I had my son. It looked and felt much more substantial and at the time it was cheaper. Now they are about the same price, I think. I love this pillow. It is large enough for even bigger babies and really saves your arms and back when you are nursing or bottle feeding. Also it is great for when your baby starts to sit up. I have used it for tummy time too. My only complaint is that it is spot clean only. The tag discourages wash since the cover might shrink. Other than that, great baby pillow!",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,This is definitely a must have. I love the extra safety precaution of the strap. I feel more at ease with this style than it\'s counterparts. Extremely soft and versatile.,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,My little boy started using this when he was just a couple of days old... Stil using it at 4 months and I can see him use it a lot longer. I feel safe strapping him in it . He takes the best naps in it.Bought a couple for my friends!,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,I\'m not sure how comfortable or workable this is. it\'s a gift and I don\'t have children.I can say that the color is the color as advertised and the packaging was good. Arrived on time with no issues,4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"Our couch is made out of the fake leather so when we sit our son on the couch using his regular Boppy he slowly slips down.  With this cover we can either put him in the cover like pictured or kind of put it under his butt.  The cover is ESSENTIAL to our lives!!!  We use the sling part in a different way than pictured...we use it under his bum as a sling to keep him from sliding down (when he was smaller his feet would rest on the inside of the sling).  And now that he is trying to sit up more we have enjoyed just slipping the sling under the pillow during those times that he\'d prefer to work on sitting.  I know that it warns against having a baby sleep in the pillow, but with the sling keeping him from sliding down, we feel much more comfortable letting hiim sleep in the pillow.  Our son loves it!",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I really love this nursing pillow - I just wish that it came with a cover so that it could be washed easily. As a plus size woman (size 20) this pillow fits around me better than the boppy pillow, and it holds its shape better too. My infant daughter is very comfortable leaning against this pillow, and it provides great support for me while breastfeeding.",4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,I love this pillow so much! It works great with breastfeeding and my son sleeps so well on it. It is bigger than a boppy and holds up great after its been washed.,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I received this pillow as a shower gift and have been exclusively breast feeding for the past 2 months.  The pillow itself is great...thick and sturdy.  However, the material is REALLY scratchy (I can\'t believe no one else has mentioned this in a review!).  My middle and ring finger knuckles were rubbed raw due to the scratchiness of the fabric.  Now I cover the pillow with a soft blanket, but this will likely become cumbersome and hot when the Texas heat kicks in.To the manufacturer: PLEASE make a soft, removable cover for the pillow!  I know others have mentioned having one made, but come on...I\'m half zombie at the moment and the last thing I want to do is venture into a fabric store, find a seamstress, and have one made.  Give a new mama a break and make it easy on us!!! :)",3
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,Nursing pillow is great. Haven\'t used it yet as baby is cozy and taking its sweet time to come out (LOL) but i think its going to be great for the mom and the baby to cuddle up in the pillow,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"My son spent the first 8 months of life in the hospital. As a result of this he had formed a rather large flat spot on the back of his head. I ordered this so I could lay him in it and keep him off of that flat spot (he could not yet roll over at this time) The first time I put him in this he was all smiles. He just loved it, and it has helped tremendously with keeping him off of the flat spot. This pillow is just wonderful, and such a great help to me for my son. And our home visiting soonerstart woman who helps with his physical development had never seen one like this before and said she was going to bring it up in her meetings and let her other parents of special needs children know about it.  I definitely recommend this pillow to all parents, it works for so many things.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"Very good product, dose what they say I dose. Also I got a very good service. Received  my package on time and well packaged.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,Easy to use and my baby is comfortable. You need to put a cloth or blanket on the pillow for messes since the fabric does not come off for washes.,4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I have really enjoyed having this item. When my infant was having trouble sleeping on her back because of acid reflux this pillow saved me. I have used the same pillow for my second daughter as well. It said it couldn\'t be washed and I thought that was gross to just spot clean. I washed it in my high efficiency washer and it came out just fine. I run a daycare now and have bought a second one for the other infant in my care. Neither of my daughters have slipped around in it, it holds them firmly in place. Now that my daughter is learning to sit up I put her in it and she sits up and plays but if she falls over the pillow catches her. I have owned this for a year and a half and I have no rips in it. It is also great for when they get a cold. It sits them up enough to let the mucas flow instead of clogging them up.",5

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,I bought this for my son. It\'s better than the regular nursing pillows because it has many uses! I love this pillow!

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I love this pillow. I had a Boppy for my first 2 boys. It was ok, but my husband had a hard time putting it around his waist to feed the babies. I decided to buy the Le\'Cuddler for our 3rd boy. This has been a great investment, not only for the baby but for me as well. While 6 mos. pregnant I trip down a set of concrete steps landing on my butt bone, I think I broke it. My Dr. advisedme to get a donut pillow. So, I figured, since I wanted a new nursing pillow, why not use this for myself temporarily. It is softer and squishier than the Boppy (the Boppy was kinda hard for my babies heads)and can fit better around the adult\'s belly. I love that is has a velcro strap for the baby when he is still too young to sit up. The pattern is nice for either gender, so it works out good for our son. The one thing I miss is the removable washable cover, this pillow either has to be spot cleaned or put on the gentle cycle in the wash. Overall, I wish I bought this years ago for my first 2 babies.",4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"Havent put this to use yet as my baby will not be born for another couple of weeks...However, I can say that its nice and cushy but still firm.

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"In short words: To let baby rest or tummy time:cuddle-u  //for nursing, tummy time, and assisted sitting:boppyI have tried both the cuddle-u nursing pillow with the strap, and the boppy nursing pillow. Before anything I\'d like to mention I NEVER used these for nursing, it never worked for me that way I simply didn\'t get the hang of it. However, I wanted something to lay him down and have him feel he was still in our arms. These both hold the same purpose, though I like the fact that the cuddle-u has the strap (which I hardly ever used because it seems uncomfortable for my son\'s chubby legs. Though I do like that the cuddle-u sinks in a little where he lays his head because it makes it safer when he wiggles around, he doesn\'t fall in between (which poses a hazard) The boppy seems more ideal for someone who is actually going to use this pillow for nursing or helping baby sit because it doesn\'t get ""flat"" as easy as the cuddle u. For that reason it is clear that the boppy makes a better nursing pillow, because you don\'t want it sinking in... cuddle-u makes a great napping pillow. can\'t beat the price! I purchased it for $24.99, it is now $19.99",4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,My little man loves it! His only a month old so I can\'t use it much but when I do let him sit in it he enjoys it cause he can sit up and watch his mommy. I recommend this item and seller.,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,We use this every day for nursing. The seatbelt portion is great to keep baby from wiggling down. I actually use this as a pillow to take naps in the family room when the baby takes his naps. Its very fluffy and hasn\'t lost any shape. I also have a boppy that I keep in the nursery and the leachco that I keep in the family room seems to be less bulky and obtrusive. I also have the whole family hooked on using it to support their arms when they hold the baby. Only thing is we bought a replacement cover as you cant take off the Sage Pin dot cover to wash it.,5

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I use it more for baby to lay on, she loves it - I\'m so happy I got this and use it constantly . I\'m bottle feeding so I\'m not sure how good it is for nursing, but it\'s great for baby to lay on and look around, she does tummy time on ot too, and the seatbelt strap is great, keeps her from slipping - she\'s a squirm worm and only 6 weeks. She\'s laying on it right now as I type! :)",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I purchased this in the Sage pin dot pattern, for a friend as a baby shower gift. She had originally wanted a Boppy, but we were both so pleased when we saw the Leachco Cuddle-U. The issue all us ladies had with the boppy from our own mothering experiences seem to have been solved by the seat strap attachment on the Cuddle-U which keeps the baby from sliding down when reclining on it. One lady at the shower, a mother of two, had used the Leachco pillow with both her babies and said it was the one thing she used daily and couldnt live without. And its good quality, just the right size and firmness (seems a bit softer than the boppy), and the sage color is really pretty. Great product, great price and worth every penny!",5

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,I have twins and wanted to get another nursing pillow for my mom to hold one of the babies. I already had the Boppy which I really liked but then saw the good reviews on this pillow and the sale price of $20 which made it an easy choice to try out. I\'m glad I bought it!Pros:- Bigger and more plush than the boppy bringing my LO higher up to the breast for a more comfortable feeding (overall comfier in the way it cushions to your body)- Baby seat holder to keep your LO upright and strapped in so no falling over/off the pillowCons:- I would give this pillow 5 stars if it had a removable cover. I\'m not sure how well it will wash up since there is none and I couldn\'t find any replacements online.,4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"This product is perfect! My 2 month old enjoys her alone time propped up on the pillow! It is great to know your little one is secure while you sit next to them, wash the dishes (always in my view), or even get a workout in! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I cannot wait to be able to use this for tummy time!",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"This is a great pillow. Nice and stuffy, fits tightly around the waist (I\'m on the small side though). I see that most negative reviews are because you can\'t remove the cover. This seems to be the case with the ""dots"" designs, not sure about the ""stars"". I\'ve ordered ""sunny circles"" and the cover is removable/washable. Good luck to you and your baby!",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I bought one of these after my daughter was born to replace the My Brest Friend (which was terrible).  I love it and so does my baby.  We are still using it 9 months later.  So when my sister in law had her baby shower I knew she had to have one.  The Velcro safety strap is a great bonus.  Except this one doesn\'t have a removable cover for washing and the one I purchased for myself did, so I left out a star for that.",4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"This is more versatile than the name brand folks talk about.  The crotch snap is the bomb.  We\'ve used it for all kinds of propping with the baby--sitting, tummy time, etc.  Our little guy has such fat thighs that the well marketed plastic seat didn\'t work for him (he could not wedge in there at 3 months even) and this was a bit of a substitute for that, supervised of course.  Never did use it much for nursing, as the good Lord saw fit to leave me with my own built in pillow post childbirth, but you can\'t fault the product for that.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"Personally, I have a boppy and a cuddle-u, and I prefer the boppy. The boppy is not only fluffier, but has a removable cover. (I know that they now make reusable covers for the cuddle-u, but my boppy came with the cover.)But the BIGGEST reason that I prefer the boppy is the very reason I bought the cuddle-u: that incredibly obnoxious ""strap"" that holds the baby in.As it turns out, not only did I not use the strap, but I ended up in a constant battle with the thing. Every time I would grab it for a middle of the night feeding, the strap would end up out and spread across my bed, and I\'d have to roll it back up and stick it back in the pocket. (Where it would stay until the next feeding, at which point it would escape again.)Needless to say, the strap lost the battle at about 2 months, when I cut it off with a pair of scissors after a particularly difficult night.It may be cheaper than the boppy, but I\'d spend the extra money to avoid the extra fabric.",2
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,Bought this for my daughter in law( baby due in Aug)  She said she can\'\'t wait to use it for the new baby,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"This pillow is great!  We use it every day.  It\'s a versatile pillow...can be used for tummy time and it aids if you are nursing, but mainly we use it as a seat/back rest.  My daughter is 3 months old and we just strap her in and she can sit upright.  It allows us to interact with her without having to hold her 24/7 and gives your arms a break!  My daughter takes naps on it all the time and I don\'t have to worry that she might fall out of it because the velcro straps keep her very snug and secure.  This pillow has been a godsend for the times that my daughter isn\'t interested in her toys and doesn\'t want to be held, but still wants attention and to be near us.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,i bought this for my niece that is 4 weeks old and there is no support for her back.  It was my fault for not paying attention but hopefully when she gets a bit bigger there\'ll be more use for it.,3
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"My newborn loves this pillow, he sleeps for hours.  My baby loves it more than being swaddled.  Because the hole is to big for my 7lb baby I place three small blankets in the middle of the pillow to fill some of the hole, it works great.  I can pick him up and move him from room to room without waking him.  My favorite part is the velcro attachment to secure my little one from slipping down the pillow.  It\'s a total score that you can use it for nursing too. I am beyond thankful that I purchased this.  I am going to buy all my girlfriends one for their baby showers. It\'s a life saver!!!",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,I really don\'t use this is a nursing pillow.  I use it to prop up my baby.  Right now she is 2 months so it\'s great to lay her in it to watch me cook or do chores.  Later she can use it for tummy time and when she can sit up.  There are so many ways to use this pillow.  It\'s bigger than a boppy pillow too.  So if you want to breastfeed I recommend a smaller pillow this one was too bulky to use for nursing.  Too hard but a good hard for baby when they want to lay or sit in it.,4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"My baby loved this!!  I received it as a shower gift.  I was planning to use it primarily while breastfeeding.  I did use it for this, but it came more in handy for the baby to sit/sleep in.  He loved it!! It was a GREAT investment.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I recently purchased this pillow for my Grandson (who lives with us). He has reflux & spits up a lot after eating.  This pillow is great for reducing that, as well as for sitting up & playing in, etc. My Grandson is almost 4 months old. I was reading thru the reviews & I would just like to point out to everyone that it is definitely noted on the packaging that you should NEVER put a child to sleep on this pillow!!  We have allowed my Grandson to fall asleep on his pillow, but ONLY when supervised.  The baby should NEVER be put to bed on this pillow, even if strapped in, to go to sleep for the night or to take a nap if someone is not going to be watching them.  I would just hate to see a child suffocate needlessly thru such an easily preventable accident.  I know that I would never be able to live with myself.  Please enjoy this pillow, but use it cautiously.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"Good idea but Bad quality....Plus the secure band cannot really hold the baby well. There is no replaceable pillow cover, so cleaning will be an issue too.Not recommended!",2
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I love this pillow and so does my son, i don\'t know why everyone is so hung up on the bobby pillow, this nursing pillow is great, and it\'s so cute, and cheaper if memory serves me correctly! My son as I write this review is sleeping in it now, he actually can\'t sleep soundly without it! and the color and the print is so beautiful and lively, it\'s my favorite item that I got for him, I might even like it more than he does :D lolThe only problem and I wish I could get someone to help me with this, is how to use the little strap that supposed to hold the baby still lol for the life of me I can\'t figure it out, I think it\'s only me though, I see everyone else with their pictures, now I\'m not saying it\'s hard to set it up or anything, but the velcro doesn\'t match up, the strap is horizontal and the part where it supposed to latch on is vertical so I\'m not sure if I supposed to ignore that or if it doesn\'t supposed to come that way everyone has one that matches up correctly and I\'m the one with a defective one lmao but anyway it\'s not even a big deal because it still works and I\'m still more than in love with this pillow definitely 5 stars",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I bought this product as a gift for my sister and she LOVES it!!! She likes that the holder is Velcro and removable, the pattern is cute and she said it it very comfortable.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I love this pillow.  I did not try the boppy first, and I don\'t see why I ever would.  This pillow is perfect for nursing (my baby was a preemie and the pillow was big enough to hold her up) and I love the strap option for when she gets bigger.  I also love the design.  Overall, a great product.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I logged on to purchase the newborn lounger but realized my baby would grow out of that fairly quickly. This pillow is a great value for the price! My 3 month old loves this we are using it quite a bit just to lounge in on my bed.My only complaint is that the strap part that my 6 year old.calls the ""underwears part"" is not stretchy so its a little stiff/tight on baby\'s chubby thighs, especially when they begin to slide down into it more. So you have to readjust him and check he is getting circulation to his legs periodically.I recommend this product.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I bought this as a shower gift for my niece in law and she loved it! It\'s comparable to a Bumpy but has the added feature of the harness for added security. I really liked this feature. The harness also folds away into it\'s own pocket if you don\'t need it, so it\'s never in the way. I would definitely buy this product again if the need arises.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I had the same for my first kid and i am buying another one since it is super comfortable to breastfeed and safe to put baby ,the strap is lil big for newborn but will be good after a while",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,my baby sleeps well in this pillow and it is of great help on the sit up training. He doesn\'t really like the security band but they can be put away anyways. The only thing keeps me from giving a 5 star is that the cover doesn\'t come off for cleaning.,4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,Bought this for new granddaughter\'s visits so my daughter wouldn\'t have to travel with her boppy.  LOVE it! And it cost so much less than the Boppy.  Same benefits as the Boppy for breast/bottle feeding and the bonus is the little strap that makes it a seat for the baby!  Only negative is that the cover cannot be removed and thrown in the washer.  Bought this on sale for $17.00 and am SO very pleased. 5 stars for sure.,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I used it to nurse and now, at 3.5 months, my son sits in it every day. I strap him in it and the strap helps him sit up without falling forward. LOVE this thing!! It\'s funny that we have a $100 dollar swing and he prefers this inexpensive pillow any day.",5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"Well the baby doesnt really like it, she sinks into it too easily and she starts to cry :( its not good at all for breastfeeding, it makes the baby up to about neck level on me, using bed pillows works better then this thing...",3
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"Bought as a gift, but wish it came with a cover.  Baby due 12/30 and I\'m sure it will get used a lot.",4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I puchased this product while I was pregnant with my son... I could count the number of times he\'s litterally used this product one hand...Now that he\'s ten months I appear it to be more useful... when he was younger he didnt want to stay in long, and I could never find the right position to make him comfatable. If he used it he didn\'t use it long... Now i find him crawling over from time to time to take a breif cat nap ;-). Maybe just my my little busy body ;-) hope others will find it more useful to them.",4
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"the fabric off tha cover its so thin,in the first wash the product made so ugly because the cover and the pillow comes together,you cant wash separatly.",1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,Love this pillow! We used it for several stages of my daughters growth. Glad we happened on it when we did!,5
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I have used it for two months now with my newborn and I am never comfortable using it. It is too low to breast feed, I have to lower myself too much I \'d rather hold him instead; it is too wide and does not fit around my waist , i  am a size Small and I guess one size for all is too big for me. It\'s summer and too hot to put my baby on top, I hold him and hope to use the pillow to support my elbow on the side, again it is too low!I don\'t know why I can\'t enjoy it like others, also the cover cannot be separated, which is a big trouble for me because I can\'t really go out at the moment and you\'d have to take the pillow to whoever can make a new cover.",2
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I thought these were the best bottles, so I registered for them for my baby shower.  I got 2 packs and while preparing for our daughter\'s arrival, I read the package insert.  You cannot use these bottles in a warmer AND when making the bottles you have to prepare the formula in a different container, then pour it into the VentAire bottle THEN wait for the bubbles to settle before feeding your baby.  It definitely doesn\'t help when you have to take the time to fix the formula in another container, warm it up and then place it in the VentAire and wait some more.  Not great when your newborn is screaming at 3am for a bottle.  I\'d rather buy something that I can make in 1 container and warm.  This bottle makes sure you have more dishes to wash in the end.  I\'m sure it\'s a great bottle but it\'s unneccesary for all of the steps you have to go through before feeding your child.",2
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,I used these bottles on my son who is now 3 years old.  No gas no spitting up.  I plan on using these bottles for my new little boy.,5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I wasn\'t too sure how these bottles worked but I was up for anything having a child who suffered with cholic from 8:30 till well past 1 in the morning every night for 3 months! Within a few days after purchasing these bottles I noticed a great deal of difference in my sons feeding habits - he didn\'t get as agitated being that the nipple did not collapse and burping wasn\'t a hassle anymore because he swallowed next to nothing in air. I would say in about a months time, he was doing a lot better with his colic. I honestly think this unique bottle design helped a great deal with that. Highly recommended.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"Love the bottle. But my son sucked for 5 minutes before I realized he wasn\'t getting ANYTHING out of the stage 1 nipple. Even month\'s later, when I decided to give the nipple another shot, he BARELY got anything out. And the stage 2 nipple was still way too fast for him. I use Gerber nipples with this bottle, despite the fact that they leak a tiny bit (because Playtex designed this bottle to not support any other kind of nipple but their own). Playtex needs to get with the program and get a Stage 1 1/2 nipple, or something. I expected more from such a great name. But I still use the bottles because I invested the money in them. Now I\'m just waiting for the day when he graduates to the stage 2 nipple...no more leaky substitute nipples.",3
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,I think that the idea of putting holes in the bottom of a bottle is the worst idea!  These bottles will leak everywhere!  After spending 15 minutes trying to express breast milk this bottle suddenly sprung a leak and the milk when all over the floor.  Save yourself clean up time and get something else.,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"This review is for Playtex Advanced Standard gift set:Pros:1.  Works with Ameda breast pump; although, not very comfortable to hold since curved bottle.2.  No need to use extra little brush to wash the parts.  I have enjoyed using Dr. Brown bottles, but needed bottles that do not need extra holes to be washed especially when I am away from home.Cons in my situation1.  I do not like that they are not straight bottles.  Easy to tip over when milk is stored in the fridge.2.  The numbers are labeled in color, unlike Dr. Brown bottles which are marked in plastic itself.  i am not sure how many washings it will take before the numbers start to disappear.2.  If you want to make 8 oz of formulated milk in the 9 oz bottle, you will have NOT have enough space to put 8 oz of water and then add 4 scoops of dry powder.Overall, good bottles.  Although, I have heard that weil baby bottles are really nice.  Have not tried those yet.",3
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"Our 12 week old became so frustrated while using these bottles because the nipples would constantly collapse.  The directions instruct you not to use an electric warmer or sterilizer.  With a total of 6 parts per bottle cleaning, warming and sterilizing are completely inconvenient.  I\'d suggest buying an individual bottle to try it out first.  In our case, these bottles weren\'t worth the money.",2
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"These bottles do have extra parts but it only takes a few seconds to put together, and because the bottoms come off they are easy to clean. I know these bottles take a few extra seconds to put together so I don\'t wait until my child is ready to eat, I have them ready to go before she is screaming for food. They don\'t leak if you make sure the vent seal is in the bottom of the bottle good, and put together when the bottle/vent is dry. I have had to make sure the nipple is in tight a couple of times or nothing came out. BUT the main fix for not getting milk fast enough is (like many reviews I was about to give up on these bottles) not letting your baby take the nipple to the base of the bottle. If their lips stay around the nipple where it starts to get bigger the milk flows fine...or at least that has fixed the problem for my baby and a friend of mine..and she had never had problems with leaks..we both own about 10 to 15 bottles each. My baby has never got to much air and she is a gulper!! You can see the air bubbles pop because of the vent when ever she takes a break and air/milk goes back in the bottle. I breast feed as well, I switch back and forth since week 4 with no problem. It did take a few times for her to get it. With  Advent she liked the nipple but the flow was way way way to fast even at stage one. So I have stuck with these.As far as not being able to use bottle warmers, microwaves, or steamers. That is the only thing I did not like. Not suppose to use a microwave to begin with because of hot spots. I use my steamer with the bottles and put the nipples and vents in the microwave to boil them faster than in a pan. To warm the milk I put water in a cup, microwave the water for about a min  place the bottle without the nipple in the water for 2 to 3 min and you have a warm bottle just as quick as a warmer and it\'s not that much more work.Worth a few extra seconds of putting together and warming to keep air out of my baby\'s belly! Hopes this helps",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,i have used these with my first baby and now with my second. they are just awesome. less air in the belly. i do warm the water in the microwave 18 seconds for 6oz. and 20 for 8oz. if the water was at room temperture first. it works great no hot spots either. i just recommend getting the stage 2 nipples when your baby turns 6m or else they are going to get a slow flow when they need a faster one.,5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,These are excellent bottles.  My daughter requested these for her shower and since the baby is doing great with these - no air or upset stomach!,5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My foster baby went through many kids of bottles as he was very anti-eating. I bought these thinking he wouldn\'t have to stop to let air in once he finally would get started. He got NOTHING! I even grabbed another bottle, filled it with water and tried. I couldn\'t get ANYTHING! I know someone who use them and she said you have to be careful because many of them don\'t work~ she had to keep taking them back and exchanging them until she got a few that did work. Well that is more than I care to do. One of my 6 worked properly and once I put it through the dishwasher it was no good. I threw them all in the trash because I didn\'t want any other baby to have to scream and cry out of frustration by being teased by a bottle.",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I\'m surprised to read any good reviews on the VentAire bottles!  I had the worst problems with these bottles.  I read some of the recent reviews and I boiled the nipples and vent piece for 5 minutes and still had problems with nipples collapsing, milk not coming out and leaking!  When you have a newborn baby and you\'re trying to feed him/her every three hours, these problems should not be occuring!!  A problem with a bottle should not even exist!  I never even thought to look at the reviews before I bought them because who would have thought a bottle would be a problem!  My baby would get so tired from me messing with these bottles trying to get them to work that she\'d fall asleep before finishing her feeding, which would then mess up her whole sleep/eating schedule.  It sounds to me like it doesn\'t happen all the time, but who wants to even mess with it!  I would recommend Dr. Brown\'s!  I switched to Dr. Brown\'s and have never had a problem with the bottles or my baby having gas, etc...",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My baby and I both love these bottles. I started her on the playtex nurser but got tired of buying the drop ins and the wide nipple made her dribble milk out of her mouth.Since using these bottles she has not spit up once and she is less gassy. I have read that some of the reviewers claim the nipples dont work... there is a trick. The nipples are designed to be sucked at the tip not the base so when she is sucking on the nipple, I gently pull it out of her mouth and she gobbles it down.They are not difficult to clean. I just take them apart and throw them in a dishwasher basket and reassemble.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My son had a very hard time using the Stage 1 nipples, so at 3 days old he was using Stage 2.  They\'re a hassle to put together let alone get clean if you sleepily leave any formula or breastmilk in the overnight (and if you\'re a normal, tired mom, you will).  I did notice that he was a little less gassy when he used these bottles, but there really wasn\'t that much of a difference.  I ended up buying a stock of Nuby bottles with medium flow teether nipples and a few Playtex Insulator bottles.  If you\'re going to buy expensive bottles and don\'t want the hassle, buy Insulator bottles or Avent Vias.  Insulators and Avent Vias have the breastfeeder nipples and they make it easier to switch back and forth.",2
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"The angled design of these bottles make them easy to hold, and our daughter doesn\'t make a huge mess with these bottles like she has with others.  I also like how the bottom removes, so it is a lot easier to get them completely clean.  She has a healthy appetite, so she quickly outgrew the smaller size by the time we stopped breastfeeding.  I would suggest just getting the 3 pack of a bigger size rather than this newborn gift set.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I registered for these bottles bc I thought they were so neat. really they are just a pain in the butt.My son didn\'t have any problems with gas. He didn\'t have problems with the nipples either. I use a microwave sterilizer and I used a bottle warmer at first(which I think all parents do until they realize its a waste of time). I occasionally had problems with the bottles leaking but that was mostly when my husband put them together(its not nice to get up for a 3am feeding and find formula all over your refrigerator bc of a leaking bottle)My main problem is that it takes so long to clean these bottles. You have to take them apart,clean all of the pieces, dry the bottom disks and then put them back together. I was gong-ho about the process at first but now that I have a 9 month old running around the house, I don\'t have the time to do this every time I wash bottles. I recommend evenflo\'s Comfi\' bottles, they are also curved they are just in one piece.",3
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"This is the bottle we started with when she was just a few days old.  I will agree with some of the other parents that is can be very frustrating, but no one could believe what a happy baby she was (very little burping &amp; gas and no spit up).  We used the #1 nipple until she was about 4 mo. old (she\'s 10 mo. old now).  When I see her not sucking well, I just open the bottom to release the pressure.  I got really frustrated cleaning all 6 parts and tried switching to Advent, but she was noticably fussier.  Now we mix the powder formula and water in the bottle and microwave it (with the nipple off and we shake it really good).  My only other complaint is that I wish you could just leave water in it, but it slowly leaks out the bottom.  With some minor changes, I think this would be a perfect bottle, but I\'m not changing this late in the game!",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I used the old version with my first child, 4 years old, and decided to try again with my newborn.  I love the new version even more and will surely use again is we have another.  The removeable bottoms make cleaning a snap and the design really does cut down on gas.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,We returned the Avent bottles and bought more Playtex VentAire instead.  Isaiah is 3 mo\'s old and he has used Stage 2 nipples from birth.  He enjoys drinking from the Playtex VentAire much more than Avent or other brands.  We believe it is because Playtex\'s venting allows him to suck without encountering increasing resistance and needing to break his seal for the bottle to backfill with air.  The Avent do seem like they would look newer longer but looks aren\'t everything.,5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"If you\'re trying to breastfeed--and either getting ready for daycare by pumping and filling bottles with mother\'s milk or supplementing with formula--you do not want to get your child these bottles. The baby\'s latch-on and use of the tongue (not gums) to pull down milk supply will not work on these nipples.The only way to get anything out of these bottles (both newborn and the next stage, which I bought to see if it was any better) is to BITE DOWN on the end of the nipple. OW! What Are They Thinking?!?After using a lactation consultant and getting a recommendation to try different nipples, we settled on the Playtex Premium Nurser set with wide-mouth bottles and silicon nipples that were shaped more like real breasts and more flexible like real skin.",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I think these bottles are great! I\'ve been using them on my 4 month old son, and it really has reduced the spitting up and gas. I used a different brand of bottles for about the first two months or so, and all he did was spit up. So I searched for a better bottle, and decided on these. He took the nipple so well, and the spitting up stopped almost right away. Yes there are a lot of parts, (the bottle, the nipple, the cap, the bubble free bottom and vent)and you have to make sure the bottom and vent are completly dry and perfectly in place before putting anything in them. It sounds like a lot of work, but really is quick and easy. It is totally worth all the time and effort to have a happy, no gassy, no spitting up baby. I completly recomend the bottle to any mom.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My 5 week old has Reflux and excess gas only caused more problems for him. We have found that adding cereal to his formula and switching to the Ventaire bottles has helped tremendously. Honestly, the bottles and cereal helped more than the Zantac has.I haven\'t had any problems with the bottles leaking nor found it terrible inconvenient to wash them. I really like that the nipples don\'t collapse at all. Before, with regular bottles my son would be half asleep and as soon as he would stop sucking on the bottle to fall to sleep the air going back in to the bottle would scare him and he would wake back up. It\'s definitely not an issue with the Ventaire bottles.I only have one complaint (which its only a personal preference anyways) I would like if the bottles were packaged in colors for each gender. For example, I\'d really rather not give my son a purple bottle. Like I said, that is only a personal preference.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I was using DR. Browns bottles but I quickly found out I needed more.  So I purchased Ventaire, I was disapointed and confused by it\'s design.  My baby couldn\'t get enough milk from the nipples so I went out and bought a bigger size, he still wasn\'t satasfied.  I use them for storage now.  I never used other bottles besides Dr. Browns so these could be excellent...BUT I found Dr. Browns work a lot better, are less likely to break and are around the same price.",2
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My daughter was spitting up horribly when I tried the Avent bottles. I switched her to Dr. Brown\'s because they\'re supossed to be the best...That didn\'t work. I finally got the VentAire bottles, and it was such a Godsend! She is no longer spitting up, we don\'t have to change her outfit 10 times a day! Thank you Playtex for this absolutely wonderful bottle!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,I bought these for my sister and she stated that the bottoms leaked.  Dr. Brown\'s is apparently the way to go.,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My husband and I weren\'t sure which to use,plain bottles or bottles with the bags in them.  We chose the VentAire bottles.  GREAT choice!  They are wonderful! Our daughter has had no problems with these bottles!  We decided not to breast feed and started her on the VentAire bottles right away, NEVER had a problem!  There are different stage nipples to buy and they are perfect! Honestly I can\'t say enough about these bottles,we love them. We tried one other brand that was given to us as a gift. We tried the ""other"" brand before she was 2months old and she wouldn\'t take the bottle at all!We have learned there is nothing you can do about gas, all babies have it but you can cut down on it! Use the VentAire and you will see!!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I originally had planned to breastfeed my son, so i hadn\'t given too much thought into buying bottles.  However, in my eighth month of pregnancy, I developed a blood clot.  My ob told me that I would no longer be able to breastfeed because I would have to be on blood thinners for the next six months and that breastmilk wouldn\'t be safe for my son.  I called my pediatrician and he reccommended the Ventaire bottles because they reduce gas and colic and "" are the best bottles out there"" So, I bought the bottles and the stage 1 nipples and prepared them exactly the way the instructions said to.  I boiled the nipples and the bottom vents, then I checked to make sure the nipples were opened and had to boil about half of them for a second time, but that was no biggie.  I dried them and put them away to await my son\'s arrival.  The night my son came home from the hospital, I get a bottle out to feed him....he couldn\'t get anything out of the nipple.  For the life of me, I couldn\'t feed him with the bottles.  I tried taking a needle to make the holes bigger, but that didn\'t help.  I ended up having to take the bottom off the bottles just so my son could eat!  The next day, I prepared the stage 2 nipples and thought that I would try that.  He couldn\'t get anything out of that one either!  He sucked and sucked and just got mad because he couldn\'t eat!  I even tried to poke the holes of the vents out, but nothing helped.  I even thought that I was tightening the bottoms on too tight but loosening them didn\'t help.  I had to go buy new bottles for him because nothing I did got them to work.  The sad part is, the bottles that work the best for him are the cheapest ones that I could find because I wasn\'t going to spend the money on another bottle that wouldn\'t work for him!  I hate these bottles and I wouldn\'t reccommend them to anyone!",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"The reason so many parents are having problems getting milk out of these is they are perforated nipples... not already opened... you need to open them yourself!!! This is very easy to do just pull opposite sides of the nipple to get the full x shaped open.These bottles are great!They come apart easily for cleaning, they help with colic and gas, and they are easily interchangeable.Truly a great bottle! I recommend to any parents... :)",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"OK ... Ventaire can be frustrating.  I have read all of the reviews saying that the stage 1 nipple is to slow, but what really happens is all of the air is sucked out of the bottle and the nipple collapses.  The stage 1 nipple is fine.. What you have to do is open the aire vent and suction off the plastic piece because it gets stuck to the bottle instead of staying in place.  I have to do this several times during feeding and it is frustrating.  When the aire piece sticks, the baby gets no milk and falls asleep or crys, so you have to watch for the collapsed nipple and fix it. It took me several weeks to figure this out and during that time I tried everything from the stage 2 nipple to poking bigger holes.  Now that I found the real problem, stage 1 nipples are fine.  Spread the word to everyone who uses this bottle.  It can save a lot of frustration. I use this bottle with my daughter, but with the next child I probably wont.  Playtex needs to come up with a way to keep this from happening and also with a way to heat the bottle easier.",3
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have a 10 month old baby and I have tried EVERY BOTTLE. I used the AVENT with my 1st baby. THESE BOTTLES ARE THE BEST! Why? Because they DO NOT LEAK, NO BUBBLES and the DESIGN is fabulous once the baby holds it her/himself. The angles top is great for LITTLE or NO AIR IN BABY\'S TUMMY. The little rubber seal/disk you put in the bottom is a CINCH! Don\'t wast time or money$$$ on any other bottle!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,The Good:-- comfortable to hold-- easy to clean-- seem to reduce gas better than reg. bottlesThe Bad:-- measurements washed off after just 1 week (hand washed too)-- leaked-- other bottles seemed better at reducing gas (born free) for similar cost,2
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I used the playtex bottles with liners for my daughter when she was really little (0-3mos)but buying new liners all the time and having to squeeze the air out while she was screaming to eat was frustrating.  I found these bottles and got one mostly because I wanted to know how they worked.  I tried them and they were great, no air bubbles so no tummy ache for my daughter.  I also liked that the nipples seal so they don\'t leak when you\'re travelling.  The only problem I had was that the nipples wore out more quickly than other ones and I had trouble finding replacements.  I\'ll definatly use these for my second child.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I received these as a gift and they do keep the gas to a minimum except the nipples keep the milk from flowing at a reasonable rate-- it\'s either too slow(which takes 45 minutes for my baby to finish or he doesn\'t finish a bottle at all or they flow so fast that my baby chokes).  He now knows when he\'s being fed with those nipples and cries unless I change the nipple.  Luckily, regular nipples work on these bottles.",2
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I tried every bottle imaginable for my daughter. She started at 3 weeks after i tried breast feeding. There were problems with all the other bottles....such as leaking, having to buy liners all the time, unmarked nipples, suction, etc. Once i tried these bottles, we were home free! They are easy to sterilize, use and clean. I like the angle of the bottle. But the best part are the clearly marked nipples. My daughter had to have rice cereal added to her formula and these nipples are clearly marked Stage 1 (Slow flow, formula only for infants) and Stage 2 (Fast flow, for cereal and/or older babies). All the other nipples i tried with other bottles weren\'t marked so i had no idea which ones were slow flow and fast flow after i had sterilized them all. I had no problems at all with these bottles and i would highly recommend them. In fact i bought extra sets to leave at the grandparent\'s houses!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"What a waste of money!  I feel had with the marketing gimick!  These were fine for about 8 months or so!  I purchased about 50+ because I have twins, and needed multiple bottles.  I learned that I totally wasted my money on these as they leak all over!  I am so tired of cleaning out my fridge!!!!  Do yourself a favor and purchase something else!  I am personally throwing ALL of them in the trash and starting over with something else, maybe Dr. Browns.  I am expecting again in a few months and don\'t need the extra aggravation of the mess to clean up and the assembly.Hope this will be useful to those contemplating these bottles.",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"Don\'t waste your time or money on these bottles. I hated these bottles.  You must buy the Ventaire nipples only, which my daughter did not like. (We used the Nuk Nipples, They are wonderful!) and the bottom was just more trouble that it was worth.  Where your baby is scream because she is hungry the good old plain Gerber bottles are still the best.  There is no assembly work needed. Just pour and serve!",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I was surprised to read all the bad reviews about these bottles.  I used to use the Playtex Disposable Nursers with my newborn but he would have formula leak out the sides of his mouth so that he wore more than he was eating.  A friend had bought me one of these 6 ounce bottles so I decided to try it.  My son is now 2 months old and he hasnt had any problems.  These bottles arent going to replace you having to burp your child but you do see that they help reduce the amount of air in the nipple.  Also, I dont use a bottle warmer but I do use a small pot filled with a little water on a gas stove to heat the bottles and I have never had any problems with the seals coming undone.  I leave the nipple off the bottle while heating (which they tell you to do anyway.  Also, I have had the bottles for almost two months now and I dont have any film.  I clean the bottles, nipples and seals with a plain bottle brush and antibacterial dish soap and I boil the nipples and the plastic seal once a week to maintain hygene.  I personally like these bottles alot and so does my baby!",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,These bottles are the only ones that I use because they are great!  My son gets less gas and is much less fussy.  One word of advice is that you must read the instructions that accompany these bottles or you will encounter the problems listed by the other reviewers.,5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I got these for my son and I must say, I really loved them.  They are kinda of a pain at first with all the pieces but they are worth it and eventually the pieces don\'t become a hassle :)  If you can do bottle liners all the time you can handle these!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have never written a review online before but I was so impressed with these bottles that I felt I should. They are great for reducing air and make for a smooth feed. After trying all different kinds of bottles (avent, evenflo, playtex nurser) with my first daughter and using evenflo with my 1 week old, these are the very best. What a difference it has made to use these bottles. My daughter is able to drink peacefully and not battle the air, plus it doesn\'t collapse like other bottles. The only catch is to make sure that you stretch out and re-open the holes on the vent disc after the initial wash/sterilization. I didn\'t at first and there was absolutely no flow. But after fixing this problem I would say these are the best bottles I have found.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have mixed feelings about these bottles. After you figure out how to use them, they work fine, that is IF you figure out how to use them. The disc has to be in perfectly or they will leak everywhere. Also, I used them for about a month until ALL the numbers on them wore away from washing them. Other than that, they worked fine for the month or so that I used them.",3
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,I fed my son for the first few months with a standard bottle and switched to these.  They are so great!  They kept the air out like they claimed and he had much less problems.  Definitly recommend.,4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I read about these bottles in a magazine and bought them to use for my newborn daughter. For my first child, I used the Dr. Brown\'s bottles and loved them; though I did not like washing the extra pieces. Since the concept here was similar and there weren\'t so many pieces to the bottle, I thought I\'d try them.  Big mistake! I tried them for 4 days.  It took over an hour just to give her a bottle each time with this system.  On the fourth day, 4 of the six nipples collapsed!  It was ridiculous.  A six pound newborn should not be able to do that to any nipple - never mind after only 4 days.  Don\'t waste your money.  I went back to the old reliable Dr Brown\'s bottles.  They are the best and I decided that she was more than worth the few extra minutes it required to clean them.",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"As many other mothers have, I tried several bottles before I found one that worked for my son. I started him on the Avent bottles but it seemed like he was taking a formula bath each time we fed him, because if you don\'t get the collar\'s on the Avent bottle just right, then it leaks. Since my son gives about 2 minutes warning that it\'s time to eat, I didn\'t have time for such scientific accuracy. I then tried the Playtex Premium Nurser, which I really like, but was looking for something more convenient than the drop in liners. That\'s when I tried the Vent Aire. My son is lactose intolerant and they really help to keep down his gas. Also, he almost never spits up on these bottles and is much easier to burp than he was on some others. They are easy just to take apart and throw in the dishwasher each evening.I, too, began to have some trouble with these bottles after I had used them for about a week and a half. The bottle began to &amp;quot;air lock&amp;quot; and the nipple collapse. Some of the reviews were helpful in troubleshooting my problems and I called Playtex (1-800-222-0453) and spoke to a very helpful representative. It\'s too bad that the Playtex website does not include some sort of troubleshooting guide. So, I will include here what I learned.1. Vent disc, bottom cap, retainer ring, and nipple MUST be completely dry in order for the bottle to seal properly.2. You must boil the vent disc and nipple once a week, even if you are washing them in the dishwasher. This helps keep the silicone in shape.3. After each washing, gently stretch the vent disc to ensure that the vents remain open.4. Make sure the baby is sucking on the tip of the nipple, instead of putting the whole thing in its mouth (this will take a little work to get the baby used to).5. Even though the Playtex website says that Stage 2 nipples are for babies 6 months and older, the representative told me that many babies start on them as early as 2 months.6. Of course, make sure the retainer ring and bottom cap are not screwed on too tight.7. If the bottle air locks during feeding, make sure the bottle is turned upside down and unscrew the bottom cap and put it back on again.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have tried all bottles and this one worked the best.  Avent made my baby gassy, Playtex nurser was to complex, Gerber he just did not like.  Than I found these.  I had no problem with stage 1 nipples, and now he is on rice in his milk and graduated to stage 2 and it works great.  I put mine in the sterilizer and it comes out clean all the time.  My husband caused it to leak one time by not putting it together properly, but I showed him and I have never had a problem.  I love these bottles and would recommend to everyone.  My baby had colic and this was such a great help.  Please try with Gripe Juice if you have a gassy or colic baby.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,I have twins and we couldn\'t figure out what was goin on we changed their formula bc they was really fussy and gassy so we was told to try these bottles and there was a major difference I will b ordering more of these soon,4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"It is true, the vent disk is hard to figure out... but once you know that the plastic bottom and the disk have to be COMPLETLY dry before putting it together, you won\'t have a problem with leaks. It just takes a little practice - just like everything else with a new baby. Also, it gets very easy to put them together... You want to talk about a lot of parts and hard to put together (not to mention expensive) try the DR Brown\'s bottles! I couldn\'t stand to keep her on those long enough to see if it helped with the gas.I also had a problem with the stage 1 nipples... My girl is a big eater and hated how long it took to get formula from those nipples! (of course we were on the avent stage 1 nipples, which will drown the baby) Switched to stage 2 and she was happy. However, I do still use the stage 1 nipples for juice and water... it helps me ensure she isn\'t getting the thinner liquids too fast - and she does just fine with those.I did have a problem every once in a while with the nipple colapsing to begin with... but for some reason, that went away quickly. Not sure if they are just broken in now, or if she just figured out how to eat from them?I did use a bottle warmer for a while (until I decided I hated that thing)Then I switched to the microwave. And I also use a steam sterilizer with these bottles. I have been doing so for 5 months now, and I don\'t have any problems - I even know that the disks are still working b/c you can see the air leaving the bottle via the bubbles! So, I think that that is just an overprecautious warning.As for the gas... little megan is VERY gassy and always has been. I tried all kinds of bottles. These seem to be better than the others, but she still gets gas and she is 6 months old now. It dosent seem to be as painfull with these bottles, and that\'s why I still use them.Give them a try, at least. What works for one, dosent work for everyone. This could be your bottle.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"When I registered for my baby shower, I inadvertently registered for the regular Ventaire bottles as well as the Natural Shape bottles (which is what I was wanting), so my review will discuss both types.NATURAL SHAPE VENTAIREFor starters, the Natural Shape bottles are good for babies who are breastfeeding, because the milk doesn\'t flow out when the bottle is tipped over.  The baby really has to suck to get it out, and it has to open its mouth wider due to the size of the nipple.Feeding my son with a stage 1 nipple took a REALLY long time.  Approximately 40-45 minutes.  However, I tried a Stage 2 nipple when he was about four months old, and the milk flowed out pretty easily.  So quickly in fact that he got really mad and refused to eat because he was getting choked.  I switched back to Stage 1 nipples, and also began relying heavily on the regular Ventaire bottles.  He is now 5 months old and we have switched to Stage 2 nipples in the Natural Shape bottles, and he is doing well.  He tends to finish a 6-7 oz bottle in about 10 minutes.  These bottles are a lot wider than regular bottles, and he has a harder time trying to grasp and hold these bottles.REGULAR VENTAIRENow for the regular Ventaire bottles.  I found these bottles to be the better of the two for us.  Although I had initially breastfed, and chose the Natural Shape bottles for that reason, I had to quit breastfeeding at four weeks.  So the issue of having a nipple that wouldn\'t confuse the baby was no longer a concern for us.The regular Ventaire bottles had no flow issues, even with Stage 1 nipples.  He finished his bottle faster with this type of bottle and seemed to have no problems with the speed of the flow.  We switched to Stage 2 nipples a couple of weeks ago and the transition was smooth.  I didn\'t notice him getting choked, and he doesn\'t have to gulp as quickly as he does with the Stage 2 nipples on the Natural Shape bottles.  These bottles are also slimmer, which makes it easier for him to try and grasp and hold the bottle.Now for the operation of both types of bottles.  They have a plastic disc that fits into the bottom ring of the bottle, then the bottle screws on, and finally the nipple in its ring screw on top of that.  On the regular Ventaire bottles the disc fits snugly into the bottom.  On the Natural Shape bottles, it has to fit into a little notch, and it is easy to think it\'s in right only to find out that its not (ie, when the milk starts leaking out).We heat our bottles in a pan of water on the stove, and the bottom rings have a tendency to hold water.  So if you use this method, you need to tap the bottle sideways on the pan to shake out the water in the ring, and I usually hold a dish towel up to the edge of the ring as well and tip the bottle so that all the hot water comes out.  If you don\'t, when you tip the bottle to feed your baby the hot water will run down onto your hand (or the baby\'s hand if s/he can hold the bottle).  This isn\'t really a reason not to buy the bottles, just something to be aware of.Finally, some people have wondered if babies swallow less air with this type of bottle.  I have two older children that I used standard bottles with, and I have seen no difference between those and these Playtex bottles.  My son still burps just as much as the next baby.  Occasionally during feeding you can hear some air leaking out, but overall, I really don\'t think it makes any difference.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I received this off of my registry and have subsequently bought two additional 3 packs of the 6 oz size as I was always washing bottles! Overall the bottles have been a good experience for us. The sleek design is great for the various diaper bags and insulated cooler bag and is easy to handle. The bottle system is easy to clean and there should be no issue of leaks provided the vented disk is inserted back correctly, which is very easy - just run your nail along the inside edge of the vented disk while pressing against the base piece to ensure a snug fit.The only issue that I have with this system is that there is no medium flow nipples. My daughter was sucking so hard and collapsing the nipple at 6 weeks with the Stage 1 nipples and it was beginning to take a long time to feed and she\'d wind up frustrated and full of gas. The Stage 2 nipples are too advanced at this point and run very quickly. Before poking any holes or bailing on the systen I tried the Gerber silicon Medium flow replacement nipples (they come in a 6 pack). They fit the bottles and worked like a charm. Now baby is happy and burps like a champ again. I did try one Avent and one Playtex disposable bottle and didn\'t like either. Give this a try.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have purchased around twenty-one ventaire bottles. My son had reflux and these seemed to work well with him.  However, the reason for purchasing the large quantity of bottles was to be able to prepare bottles ahead of time.  I cannot.  These bottles constantly leak.  When you pay $8.00 for a 32 ounce bottle of formula you want it to go to your baby - not on the counter!  I am very frustrated that a company would not have designed the vents better and made them more accessible for the consumer to purchase additional vents.",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I bought this bottle as a first time parent after reading positive reviews thinking that this bottle would cause less gassiness, spit up, etc... in my baby and did I think wrong.  Using the 1st stage nipple, my baby was just sucking air and not getting anything over the course of at least 30 minutes into a feeding and with the 2nd stage nipple, the bottle was empty in less than 10 minutes with half the formula all over my baby\'s bib because it was coming out too fast for my baby to swallow!  Plus, they are a pain in the neck to clean and put together.  FIRST TIME PARENTS: Only buy a couple of bottles of brands that you research and try them out because you will only waste time and money if the bottles don\'t work out and not all babies will take to certain bottles.  I made the mistake of purchasing the gift set and a couple of packages of the 3 packs and now I am stuck with these useless bottles that have only caused me headaches.  I did much better with plain baby bottles by Gerber and Evenflo, without the gimmicks!",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,I just wanted to say I received this set at a shower and have absolutly loved using it.  I have found that my son has less gas and took to these bottles quite easily after brestfeeding.  My sister recommended them to me and I want to recommend them to you.  They are great! And what\'s even better is that there are no daily consumables.,4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"These bottles are awful!  The nipples constantly collapse, stage 1 is too hard to suck and stage 2 chokes my baby.  I had a pack of these and a pack of Dr. Brown\'s.  Sarah takes the Dr. Brown\'s bottles very well, the nipples are perfect and she has no gas from those.  Every time I used a VentAire for feeding, she\'d wake up an hour later with gas bubbles in her tummy.  I don\'t recommend these at all.",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have read all the reviews of this product and I can\'t believe some of the negative comments... especially the review referring to its usage in a bottle warmer. I love this bottle. And I DO use it in a bottle warmer. It works fantastic. AND I\'ve never had a problem mixing the formula right in the bottles. As for the comments about this bottle dripping the hot water from the warmer - it\'s really very simple - just make sure that when you shake up the formula in the bottle that you shake all the water off the bottom of the bottle. NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL! And Ive NEVER had any milk leaking out of this bottle. You just have to assemble the bottle correctly. It\'s really very easy. I would highly recommend this bottle. My daughter went back and forth from breastfeeding to the VentAire bottle with ease, and she has minimal gas. It\'s always very simple to get a burp out of her afterwards. GREAT BOTTLE!!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"We received the VentAire Bottles as a shower gift along with Evenflow and Avent Bottles.  Our son was exclusively breastfed for the first two months and when it was time to adjust him to bottles it was not easy.  He choked with the Evenflow and the Avent even though my friends had used and liked these bottles.  Dad and I also hated the Avent and Evenflow bottles because milk would stream out of the nipples(even though they were stage one!)  My son would only use then VentAires after trying them all for a few weeks.  Plus I hated how much milk would pool out of his mouth with the other bottles.We hand washed all the parts with a bottle brush...Which some reviews thought was a pain, I was hand washing the others and the VentAires were actually the easiest to clean because our large brush did not fit so well into the other bottles, (and the brush slides in and out because of the open sides...instead of having to fish around the bottom of the others to make sure they were clean.) There is only two extra items to clean compared to the others(the bottom lid and the seal.)In response to some reviews saying the flow was way to slow or that they could not get the milk to flow at all, We had that problem once or twice but we discovered that we had sealed the lid way too tight...After loosening it it worked perfect. Plus, after a while we switched to Stage 2 Nipples which posed no problem.Our son loved breastfeeding and at first it was a struggle giving him bottles when we needed to...Until we used only the VentAires, (by my son\'s decision!)  With my next son, due in Dec, I\'m only going to register for these!!!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My son was a premiee, and it was very hard in the beginning, we were given the Tiny bottles in the hospital, with the nuk nipples.  this is our 2nd child, and we used these with our first, she was also a premature(2 months)she is 4yrs older, and I swear my husband and I felt clueless all over again, we couldn\'t figure out why he wasn\'t eating, we swichted to advent then back to the Vents, and the other reviews were right, we even called the 1-800 number, and they suggested to try the stage2 nipples, now at 8 months, we mix the cereal with the formula, and he has no problems.  the colors are great, they are great to clean.  So I would suggest stage2, and I am buying them for my sister-in-law.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"When my husband and I had our first child (5 mos. ago) we had registered for the Avent bottles.  Little did we know, but soon came to find out, that the formula was just pouring out of our little one\'s mouth, even using a stage 1 nipple.  We tried Gerber, Dr. Browns, and Evenflo bottles and none of them compare to the VentAire bottles.They cause her no gas at all.  And, the nipples are just right for her.  With the stage 1 nipples, she gets formula only.  However, when the ped recommended thickening her formula, we switched to the stage 2 nipples, and she does great with them.Now, when we have #2, we will be sure to use these bottles.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"We tried various types of bottles before we started to use this one. My son could not take to the other bottles and the nipples, and when using this one, he sucked in less air (making him less noisy when eating)and he was able to eat comfortably (ie less drool while eating). We like the fact there are two types of nipples as well (stage 1 and 2).  We use the stage 2 when we add cereal and stage one when there is just formula -- hence we do not have to poke holes in the nipple!  It takes a couple of seconds to put together and they are very easy to clean.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,These bottles are GREAT...they are especially good for mothers who breastfeed &amp;amp; bottlefeed. It helps your child to build their jaw muscles so when it\'s times to breastfeed they won\'t be *lazy* on the nipple. My son loves these bottles and won\'t use anything else. They are honestly a MUST HAVE ITEM.,5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"These are great bottles for babies, and are proven to help reduce gas so less burps!  This are the same kind of bottles we used for our second child, so when we found out we were having ANOTHER baby, it only made sense to get the best bottle out here.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My son was very fussy when he was new and had lots of gas.  I had about seven or so of these bottles from an inlaw.  I decided to use them and no gas and no more fussy baby.  I continued to use them up until this month.  I have no time for bottles with so many parts.  My son is crawling and pulling up..so I am busy all the time.  The bottles are great!!! I never in the seven months had a leak problem the wasn\'t strickly human error (mostly by my husband).  It is a good idea to put them back to gether when clean they do consume time if you are in a hurry.  You can buy replacement parts in my area( the nipple and bottom seals).  Great bottle, Great buy!!!!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,These bottles are great!  Our daughter took to them right away and they really seem to help with keeping the air getting into her stomach.  It\'s also great to not have to deal with liners and stuff when you are getting the bottles ready.  They\'re also easy to assemble.,5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I bought these bottles instead of the avent bottles hoping the vent would truly work as advertised. I am breastfeeding my newborn so I purchased the new natural shape version. After sterilizing bottles according to directions I attempted to warm some refrigerated breast milk in warm water per directions. The water I was warming the milk with immediately became cloudy as my hard earned breast milk leaked out through the vent in the bottom. Feeling a little frustrated to have wasted 3oz of breast milk I decided to warm the milk in a seperate container then pour it into the bottle, this time the milk didn\'t leak out of the bottom but when I went to feed my daughter she became drenched from leaking around the nipple. I have since tried several differnt things- taking apart the bottles and reassembling to ensure tight and proper seals, switching out nipples thinking the one I was using was just defective, so on and so on. My daughter spent her first days of life in the intensive care nursery and is jaundice, her feedings are very important and I work extremely hard to provide her with the best- breast milk. These bottles cost me several wasted ounces of breast milk, I would not recommend using them- ever.",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,It all depends on your kids if these bottles work for you or not? If the kids don\'t like them neither will you,3
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"Our baby is almost 4 months old, and we love these bottles. I haven\'t had any problems with the vent bottoms wearing out, and only noticed film on the nipples when they didn\'t seem to be rinsed well enough after washing. We tried other slow flow nipples, but found that these work the best. Plus the bottles are so easy to clean, I don\'t have to worry about whether or not there is any build up left in a bottle that has been sitting for a while. I have been sanitizing the nipples and vent bottoms in the Medela Quick Steam Micro Clean bags (you use them in the microwave) and haven\'t had any problems with either of them.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I bought these bottles because they were highly recommended by my sister who has 3 youngsters. My son did HORRIBLE ON THEM! He would be so gassy at times he would scream in pain for hours.-The ""vent"" DOES NOT let air into the bottle so the baby has to release the nipple to let air in so they can keep drinking.-you can not use electric bottle warmers-Assembly UGH!-Pricey!! DOUBLE UGH!!!!I gave EVERY  vent air bottle to my sister, my son does GREAT on the disposable bottle liners, no gas, no fussing, HAPPY baby!",1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have had these bottles for 2 months.  They were great for keeping air out, but the nipple is small.  It\'s great for a new born not older than a month. After that, my baby seemed to be sucking with a little more trouble.  Later the bottom of the bottles started leaking as soon as I put warm milk in them. It was frustrating.  I had to throw them away.  There was no use in having them anymore.",2
Lambs &amp; Ivy Jake Musical Mobile,"My husband and I bought the mobile ""Jake"" because it matched our bedding, lamp, etc. We were pretty disappointed in the quality and usefulness of the mobile. We thought it was way overpriced at almost $50. While it does play music, the music only last for about 2 minutes and came out sounding shrill and high-pitched. It wasn\'t soothing or comforting at all- I couldn\'t wait for it to stop playing, so I can\'t imagine my baby (not born yet) would enjoy such a high pitched sound. The animals that hang from the mobile are okay, but there is only 4, with no mirrors or soft lights. The best thing to say about the mobile is that it was easy to put together (we mounted it on the crib, but there is also a wall mount option). Ultimately, we decided to return it and look for something that plays better music for a better price.",2
Lambs &amp; Ivy Jake Musical Mobile,"I bought this mobile right after I purchased the sheet set. It matches very well and was not that hard to install, my husband was able to have it up and running in about 6 minutes.",5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Jake Musical Mobile,"The only good thing about this mobile is that it matches the Lambs and Ivy Jake set. Other than that it is absolute garbage.The cheap plastic molding of the assembly scratched my $600 crib and it is still not very secure. The mobile squeeks while playing music and it plays virtually for about 2 minutes. Then you have to wind it again. This Item is really good at it\'s main purpose however, which is suckering you to pay $30 because you have the rest of the set. If this piece was included in the set, I would expect this kind of quality, selling it as an extra cost is ridiculous. The good reviews must be based on looks alone , avoid at all costs.",1

It was not too difficult to set up, although they could have made the process simpler, but OMG... it was impossible to open once installed.They advertise that you can open it with one hand, but people who can do that must be magicians. I could not open this gate even using both hands.Needless to say, it is going back to BabiesRUs and now I have to search for another gate that will fit my 39 inch opening at the bottom of the stairs.",1
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Walk-Thru Gate,"This gate sure looks nice, but after 1 1/2 hrs of tring to install and widen the gate - we have to return it.  My husband\'s thumbs were throbbing for hours later. You have to press in so hard to extend it- it was ridiculous! Well, after it was installed, I had to test the &quot;easy one hand operation.&quot; I could not press in the button to open the handle for my life. My fingers too were throbbing.  I couldn\'t keep it if I couldn\'t open it with one hand.  I even tried two hands - and no go.",2
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Walk-Thru Gate,"I just bought this gate last night and am very disappointed. This is absolutely the worst gate I have ever dealt with and I have used quite a few in my years as a child care provider, as an aunt and as a parent. First, the instructions are not as clear as they could be, but I can work around that. Second, it has not just the one little metal button on the handle to open it with. There are 3 more that you have to use to adjust the thing! Impossible to do through the mesh on the door part. Third, the only reason I even gave it one star is because once I got it tightened in to the door frame, even the Incredible Hulk couldn\'t have budged it. But then I couldn\'t open the walk-thru portion, so I tried loosening the bolt a bit...and the top of the gate fell out of the doorway!! I chose this gate because it was taller than most and we could walk through rather have to climb over. Well, I am taking it right back to the store and buying the stationary mesh gate that costs half as much, which is what I should have done to start with.",1
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Walk-Thru Gate,"My wife had a friend who had hurt herself with one of the older style baby gates, so she insisted that I get the best one I could find.  I had no problems whatsoever putting in the gate, and with 3 little kids and a very energetic dog running around, I was very happy to be able to install it quickly and easily.  Right away I was able to see why it was better than one of those traditional wooden gates...my dog chased my 2-year old right into the mesh (at full speed) and despite the look of panic on my face, my son bounced off and continued along his merry way with the dog in tow.  My wife likes the clean look of the gate, and we both find it very easy to open and close the gate with one hand, which is the most that either one of us ever has free these days.  For you other husbands and dads out there who have been yelled at for buying the \'wrong\' thing on other trips to the baby store, I can tell you that I was very happy to finally see a smile on my wife\'s face once I had put this gate up.  We have been using it for over a month now ... my wife tasked me with buying a few more of the same gate for our other doorways and stairwells.  This gate definitely gets a big thumbs up from our household!!",5
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Walk-Thru Gate,"I believe I got one of the first ones.  I was attracted to it because it mostly uses a soft mesh to be the barrier not metal or wood which would just be another hard surface in my house.  It was easy to set up, expanded into the doorway I needed it to and plus it\'s a walk-through gate which makes getting through a breeze.  The handle to open and close it really works well, especially when I have my hands full : )Anyway for all the features and the price I thought this was the best gate out there, and with 2 kids, one on the way, and a dog I\'ve seen and used plenty.",5
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Walk-Thru Gate,"This product is, without question, the worst I have purchased thus far. Forget about how it works, mine didn\'t even come manufactured at a 90 degree angle. I have never felt the need to post a review on this site until I got this piece of garbage into my home. I am convinced that the people that wrote positive reviews about this product have some sort of vested interest in this company. Don\'t buy this gate.",1
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,"I decided to go with a lavender color theme instead of the usual pink for my expected baby girl.  Most stores that I looked at had nice pink sets, however all the lavender sets had some kind of green plaid, which I did not like. When I saw this item online, it looked beautiful, and just what I had in mind.  I just recieved the bedding and I can not stop looking at it and calling all my friends to tell them how beautiful it is.!!! I am a designer myself, and quality as well as design are both important factors for me, This set is cleverly/beautifuly designed and coordinated. The quality is very good.  It is 100% cotton, (except for the dust ruffle which is mixed, and that is OK!), the bumper is not fluffy, it is nice and flat, which makes for a safer bumper, (the fluffy ones are like a step for the baby to get out of the crib-unsafe)The bed sheet has elastic all around , not just on the corners, which makes it safer and more secure! and is so soft!I also ordered all the matching items, and have a beautiful look going, the walls I will paint half way in lavender and use the border wall paper as a seperation between the top white and bottom lavender wall color!Also the price is great most bed sets can range from $250-$650and the cheaper ones are only 4 pieces or ALL polyester.So I think this is the best dealNothing beets this one!!!!!!-Sheerlee",5
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,I also loved this for my new daughter she loves the purple butter flies and everything.I heard that you needed accesories for it so all you do is type in paloma and you should get all the accesories for it. Hope I helped you!!!!,5
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,For the arrival of my first child I wanted a beautiful bedset without all the pink! When I saw this set online I instantly fell in love with it. But since looks can be deciving on the internet I went to the store to check it out and put it on my registry right away.Its very beautiful and so far i have had no problems with it.Anouther person stated that the quilt was a bit miss-stitched and I have seen the same thing on mine as well other than that its just wonderful.Although I wish the valance was sheer instead of thick material.,5
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,"We chose this bedding set for our little girl, We had decided on  another set, but after we got the nursery all painted, which we painted the room lilac and lavender, we we\'re shopping for furniture at Babies R\' Us and seen this set, we changed our mind completely, the set is beautiful. The comforter is so comfy feeling, with a look of denim, it\'s thick and so soft. And being that it\'s six pieces it leaves you with less you have to buy for the set. I\'m definitely satisfied completely with this set.",5
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,I decided what my baby girl\'s room scheme would be based on this bed set. It is sooo cute and pretty.  The fact that the butterflies match with other bedsets manufactured by kidsline makes it easy to find accent pieces like the butterfly rug and lamp.  I received both the Paloma mobile and the baby einstein mobile as gifts.  I tried both.  I decided to use the baby einstein one because my daughter was more entertained by it.  I think bright colors are better for mobiles and the paloma is pastel and not very eyecatching since it blends in with the bedding.,4
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,"I fell in love with this set when I first saw it.  I thought it would look beautiful in my daughter\'s bedroom, and it does.  My only complaint is the comforter\'s quality is not what I expected.  After 1 wash (and line drying), the lighter side had little cotton balls all over it and it became very lumpy.  I was also disappointed with the stitching.  Overall it\'s beautiful to look at, but the quality isn\'t there.",3
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,"This item is just beautiful. My daughter has this for her baby. The theme is beautiful. one thing I did notice is that the fabric on the dust ruffle is very thin, so thin you can see right through it. I dont know why they didnt use the same fabric as in the curtain.It seems very easy to rip and tear on the crib. otherwise this set is just perfect.",4
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,"As my older daughter is 9 yrs old and our 2nd child was a boy, we needed a new crib set for our new baby girl.  I had decided early on that I would do lavender for her, since pink was a little too classic for me.  I searched online and in stores for the perfect set and found it in Babies R\' Us when gift shopping for a friend.  This set is gorgeous and has just enough pink in it to match our pink crib. (Yes, pink crib!) The details are extraordinary and the quality is amazing.  The best part is, you get most everything you need for under $200!  The only disappointments I found with  with this set were: a.)  the lamp is not as good looking as the rest of the set so we passed on it and b.) we have had to buy the coordinating accesories on separate visits to BRU.  The mobile is adorable and perfectly matched.  I am tickled that Kidsline has just made matching basket liners available for your changing table or toys or whatever - however, be wary, you will do better to buy their 3 piece basket set at BRU because you will never find the right size elsewhere!  We settled for the white, but they are still beautiful!  If a little princess is in your future, this is the luxury you are looking for!  You will not be disappointed in the quality or beauty of &quot;Paloma&quot; - I do not plan to part with it after she outgrows it!  It is too precious!!!!",5
Jake Baby Crib Bedding by Lambs &amp; Ivy,"We received the crib set, lamp, mobile and border as a baby shower gift from my parents. Since we had just bought our first house I was anxious to set up a nursery for our 2nd boy! I fell in LOVE with the pattern when I saw it in the store. Pictures don\'t do it justice!! The set is so soft and comfy. Our baby boy loves to stare at the border while I change his diaper. We painted the nursery 2 colors. Top half is blue and bottom is green. To separate the 2 colors we put up molding in the middle with the border above it!",5
Jake Baby Crib Bedding by Lambs &amp; Ivy,"This made my son\'s nursery complete! The design is very nice and the sheets weren\'t too thin. The side ties on the bumpers may have been a little short, making me have to tie them in knots instead of bows.",5
Lambs Ivy Jake Diaper Stacker,"I bought this for my baby\'s nursery, we are not having a full crib set or nursery room hence the fact that you can order the diaper stacker and bumper only in the same design is a big plus, they look great and have a very good quality, can\'t wait to start using it once my baby is here!!!",5
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"I absolutely hate this carseat. The only reason I purshased it was b/c consumer reports recommended it. I am all about safety when it comes to carseats. If I was ever in a car accident and my child sustained any injuries I need to know the carseat was correctly installed and my child was properly restrained or I would feel and be responsible.My car is not equipped with the latch system so I use the center lap belt and I can not get this carseat in tight nor my husband. It moves well over an inch from side to side. Even the tether strap is impossible to get tight. This carseat does not seem safe to me at all. I have read many of the other reviews and received some pointers on installation such as changing the recline position. I will definatly try these. But let me say thisNO CARSEAT SHOULD BE DIFFICULT TO INSTALL!!!!I shouldn\'t have to do additional research to install this carseat.I also do not like the ""puzzle"" belt for belting my child in. What purpose does that serve other then a hassle. It\'s also hard to get the belt snug against my child. The carseat itself is huge nobody else has room to sit in the backseat of my honda civic with my child. The cupholder doesn\'t seem to be appropriatly placed nor the head rest. My child ends up falling asleep with her head next to the side of her body.BUY BRITAX!!!",1
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,I am really happy with our purchase.  My son was barely big enough to move out of an infant seat when we put him in the summit.  I love the easy adjustalbe shoulder straps.  I feel safe with the 5 point harness system.  I love the reclining for long trips.  I\'ve also washed the cover multiple times and find it holding up to the task.  I haven\'t had any accidents or near misses with this seat so I\'m trusting consumer reports that it\'s safe.,4
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"I bought this carseat almost a year ago for my son when he was 18 months old, I had a fisher price carseat for him which I loved, but the straps no longer tightened, so I didn\'t feel it was safe any more.  So after a lot of research, and talking to friends, and actually buying one carseat and then returning it, I bought this one, and both myself and my son love it.  Yes the straps bunch up and you have to flatten them out before buckling it, I have never had them twist.  I have never had any problem getting it in a car tight enough with the buckle, and I have had it in a car, a truck, an suv, and my own minivan, and have never had a problem.  Nor have I had a problem with the piece in between his legs EVER coming out, I think that has a lot to do with no putting it in right and making sure it is sitting right, if you take it apart and wash it you must make sure that when you put the latch piece that goes in between there legs back in that you make sure it is lying flat against the bottom of the carseat or it could come out.  I have been so happy with this carseat that I am planning on buying another one in the near future to put into my husbands truck (which my son rides in about 50% of the time that he spends in a vehicle), because my son won\'t be able to use the one in there for that much longer.  I actually plan on putting the new one in my van and the old one in my husbands truck.  Well I hope this information helps.  I definetely recommend this one.",4
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"After searching high and low (and reading reviews far and wide), I settled on this seat and have been very pleased.  It adjusts easily, buckles easily, tilts back nicely, stays cooler than one with dark fabric and seems comfortable for both my car seat riders (25lb 1.5yr old and 35lb 3.5yr old).  Best of all, even though I had to move my son (1.5yr old) to the ""door"" position from the middle position b/c the two seats were too bulky to strap in next to each other in my Geo Prism, my kids can still hold hands and pass toys to each other.  We are happy (and presumably safe, too!).Two minor complaints: cupholder is a waste of plastic (and I\'m not fond of waste) and the crotch buckle has a perverse tendancy to fall backwards towards the back of the seat b/c both kids\' seats are tilted back halfway.  For my son, this is no big deal b/c I\'m still lifting him in and so forth.  For my daughter, we have the inevitable struggle to wiggle it out from under her bottom every time we get in.  I\'m thinking of attaching a velcro dot, so that it could be stuck to the seat where I want it to be...but then there\'s the possibility of wrecking tights and other girly clothes...we\'ll see.  Great seat.  Would buy it again and recommend to friends.",5
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,I bought this for my 3 year old and I owuld never buy it again. The straps are forever getting tangled which makes it very hard to buckle the child in. Plus the place where you snap the buckles into is always getting jammed. I would not recommend this car seat,2
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"We received this carseat when our son was 9 months old, he is now 17 months old and we still love this seat. He is above average in size, currently about 33 inches tall and 28 pounds at 17 months.We use the carseat in our 2003 Honda Civic, but we have also moved it into other vechiles without much trouble. I feel that the carseat is secure and safe. We\'ve never had any difficulty with the harness or fitting the two pieces of the buckle together to secure him in the seat, even when he\'s not in the mood for a car ride.Our son enjoys the armrests and the cupholder features. The chair is positioned nicely so that his head doesn\'t flop forward when he falls asleep, and he looks pretty comfortable.",5
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"I can\'t tell you how happy I am with this seat.  I got for my son right before he turned three.  He is one for falling asleep in the car and we had another regular booster that doesn\'t recline.  And his little head would be hanging and bobbing around.  I hated to see that.  We got this and now when goes to sleep, I can reach back and recline the seat and he\'s comfy cozy!!!",5
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"My husband and I were a little afraid of buying this car seat because of the bad reviews we saw. Being safety freaks, we made an extensive research on car seats for our 2 year-old, 35 pounds and 38"" toddler. At the end, we were undecided between the Cosco Summit High Back and the Britax Roundabout. We came to the conclusion that the Cosco Summit High Back would be a better buy because the Britax Roundabout was on recall not too long ago. Also, this one is the safest (according to Consumer Reports) and because of its safety, it would be worth facing the pre-installation issues that other parents reported here. So we bought the seat and we are extremely happy with it. First, keep in mind that reading the manual is the first thing you have to do - it\'s boring, but very important, specially when it\'s for your children\'s safety. So here\'s what we found out about the problems and complains:1 - IT DOESN\'T RECLINE - Yes, the seat reclines, but our understanding, contrary to what some people wrote here, is that the car seat should to be reclined once is installed on the car. Remember that, once installed, the car seat should not move more than one inch in any direction. So it looks to me that you shouldn\'t recline the seat once installed, period. The seat reclines to better fit the different inclinations of the back seats that different cars may have. For example, our Saturn VEU (where the car seat was installed) has a very upright backseat, but other cars have a backseat more inclined. The reclinable option of the Cosco car seat gives you the chance to change the inclination of the car seat so you can find the perfect fit for the back seat of your car. So before installing, check how inclined the back seat of your car is. Then try to find the angle of inclination on the car seat that will better fit the inclination on the back seat, and stick with it. I cannot tell for sure, but I guess some folks had trouble getting the seat tight enough on their cars because of the wrong inclination. Actually, my opinion is that, in order to avoid confusion, Cosco should change the description ""reclinable"" to ""adjustable inclination"", so consumers wouldn\'t be induced in error when buying the seat.2 - TWISTING STRAPS - Yes, the straps tend to twist, but that\'s only if you pull them just in one side. If you pull them together and as even as you can when you are going to adjust the straps on your child, they won\'t twist. We were getting upset with the twisted straps, but then we realized it was our own fault. Now that we know the trick, it didn\'t happen anymore.3 - IT DOESN\'T FIT MY CHILD -  Some parents are complaining that the straps don\'t fit well on their children. If you read the manual, you are going to see that they recommend you take the straps out and put them back together again before you install the seat. That\'s because you have to adjust the straps and the seat\'s features to fit your own child. We had to move the shoulder straps from their place and the in-between-legs lock as well so it would fit our son. At first it didn\'t seem to fit our kid, but once we read the manual and made the necessary arrangements, it now fits like a glove. Again, I can\'t speak for other people\'s children, but it worked for us. Just remember that is a question of how you do it, and not of how much strength or force you put into it. So if it looks like your child isn\'t comfortable and snugly secure, don\'t use force - take the child out, readjust it, and try again.4 - IT DOESN\'T STAY SECURE IN OUR CAR - We are lucky enough to have a car with LATCH system. It took my husband literally two minutes to install the car seat, and it doesn\'t move a single bit in any direction. If it did move, I wouldn\'t have let my son ride in the car at all until the County\'s inspection, since I am ""the"" safety freak. But it is very secure and it doesn\'t move at all, so I\'m very happy to say that I think we are fine. Of course, even being extremely tight on our car, I\'ll go through the inspection (something I recommend every parent to do). But I\'m positive the car seat will pass the inspection. I cannot rate the car seat installation using the seatbelts, but it works very well with the LATCH system.Well, that\'s it. We are happy with our purchase and so is our son, who loved his new roomy and comfy seat. (I can\'t wait until he finds out that there\'s a place for his cup too!). Just read the manual and, most importantly, go through a car seat inspection conducted by a certified car seat installation technician. You can call your local police department and they are going to be able to direct you to where you can find such person. I hope this review helps!!!",5
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"Like other reviews, I noticed the Consumer Reports evaluation of this seat.  My wife had already purchased the seat to give our oldest daughter room to grow (she is now three).  I had a terrible time with the straps twisting, the material just seemed to thin.  With my schedule, I didn\'t have the time to untwist until I put her in the car.  She often found the straps uncomfortable.To be fair to Consumer Reports, they only gave it a top rating as a booster seat.  Of the ones that they tested, it performed the best as a booster, it held onto the seatbelt better than the rest.We are keeping it for use as a booster, but will probably look for a different brand for our youngest as the straps twist.  Since my oldest loved to help buckling herself in, it was often difficult to accomplish.  She got pretty good, but the twisted straps made the tension difficult to connect to the buckle without loosening every time.",3
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"Hi just wanted to say I bought this 6 weeks ago for my just turned two year old daughter. She loves it. I love it. It is big enough for a few more years. However, I did try my friends 9 year old daughter in it (weighs 75 pounds) and she is WAY too tall but then is tall enough for NO booster anyway.The straps DO NOT twist if you take your time getting your child in and out and making sure they are straight before putting your child in. Also, you should tighten the straps after closing the buckle but BEFORE you close the CHEST clip to allow the straps to move. That is according to the instruction manual and seems to work more than fine for a tight fit.The two piece buckle is EASY to use. I just wonder how the manufacturers think it prevents a child undoing the buckle though.It fits VERY snugly in my MAZDA MPV on the captains chair - without LATCH. Yes when you recline the seat you have to re-tighten the cars seat belt and also  recline your vehicles seat.I have found that installation is faster and better if you install the seat in the recline position then move it into the upright position for use.I have installed this in less than a minute in a friends Suburban using the LATCH system and was extremely impressed with how tight it was in the seat. I actually had trouble LOOSENING the LATCH to remove the car seat after our trip!Overall I think this car seat is great value for the money. I rated it a four star as I have yet to use it as a booster. I don\'t forsee any problems when that time comes though.",4
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"This seat has to be the most frustrating seat EVER created and I wish now that I had taken more time when I was choosing.  The hassle I have with it is the clip on the seat  belt, it is like a puzzle and is so annoying, my 5yr old gets stressed out every time she has to do as it takes such concentration and is just a total pain.  I cannot tell you how many tears and stressed out times we have had trying to get her into this seat, the Graco I have in my other vehicle is such a breeze and she can clip herself in everytime without a fuss.  The one star is ONLY for that it sits up higher allowing her to see out the window really nicely.  DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT unless they have changed the clip on the belt by now.",1
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"I bought this seat after my reached the weight and height requirements. He was about 1 1/2 when we started using it. He\'s now going to be three and we still us it. The seat is sturdy enough, the car seat cover is easy to remove and comes clean easily. I have only two complaints about the seat...one is the size of the seat with the base. It\'s not an easy seat to get in and out of a car. The second complaint is that I had a hard time with the seat straps, they always were twisted. Overall this seat is good.Was it worth the money? I would problably say yes...we\'ve had it along time, and have gotten our money out of it.",3

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This has been a great help for our infant daughter. She\'s been in sleepsacks since practically birth. She stays warm and snug and can\'t kick it off. We only use it at night, so when it goes on, she knows it\'s bed time. It\'s part of the routine now. Highly recommended!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We have used only Halo sleepsacks since our little one was in the NICU and started wearing them.  We have always liked the quality and material...this time it had zipper trouble.  He often got stuck in it and/or would wake up as we tried to get it zipped up at night.  Very disappointed.,3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I love these sleep sacks.  We have two daughters, 8 month old and 2 1/2 years old and they both wear them every night.  It is great not having to use blankets that they will get tangled in or accidentally throw off.  Washes perfectly.  Great color.  Zips from top down, so you can still change diapers without taking it all the way off.  Roomy at the bottom, so my 2 1/2 year old can walk around in it.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I have used Halo Sleep Sacks from the time my son was born, and I loved the fact that there were no loose blankets in his crib. Most babies kick their legs in their sleep, and they can\'t kick off this blanket! . He is only 4 months old, but a big and long baby, so when he grew out of cotton infant size Halo, I ordered 2 fleece blankets in XL. They are perfect- warm and extra long, with large arm holes, so he can grow into the length. Hopefully they will still fit  next winter. The fleece is warm, so the layer underneath should be light. The color is adorable, and I love that the zipper unzips from the bottom, making the night time diaper changes easy.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","These sleep sacks are wonderful! My granddaughter used them all winter....and where we\'re from, it gets very cold at night. She was snug as ever. Not too warm, not cold at all. I would HIGHY reccommend these to new parents. What a wonderful idea someone came up with....sleep with no worries about the blanket covering the infant\'s head!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We\'ve used the sleepsack since our daughter was born.  No worries about blankets getting wrapped near her head/mouth.  The last few months we haven\'t used one as it was summer but now that it is cooling off (and we found her with her blanket bunched under her head half covering her face) we decided it\'s time to buy more (in larger sizes now that she is 16 months old).It definitely brings peace of mind regarding safety and that your baby is nice and warm (but not too warm thanks for the armless sack) during the night.  Definitely worth the money!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This is much better than swaddling, after your baby is about six months or older.Rumor is that swaddling after this age can actually damage your baby\'s hips, so we used this.It takes a few days for baby to get used to movement in arms when they are sleeping, but keeps them so warm with this fleece sleepsack. We have a few of these for winter times, and throw them in the washer/dryer frequently to keep them clean.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This sleepsack is so convenient. Just tuck the little one in and there ya go - no blankets needed. This is very nice especially if your baby tends to kick a regular blanket off when s/he sleeps. We found that the Halo sleepsack was the best over ANY others b/c of how soft the material is and the zipper zips down rather than up towards the neck so you don\'t have to worry about 1) having their skin get caught and 2) having to unzip the entire sack if you need to change a diaper.  Also, the material is so comfortable but it also is a good climate control, our daughter was never too warm (warning for SIDS) or too cold (which can wake a baby up). She was very comfortable all night long - however, I would recommend that on cold nights, you put them in a long sleeve onesie or sleeper since the sack doesn\'t have sleeves. This is a MUST HAVE for all parents. I\'ll probably get one in each size for the rest of the year!",5

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","True to size, we\'re happy with the quality and the sizing. And, it\'s easy to put on and take off!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","All my three children have worn sleep sacks until age 4!  I have gone through quite a few as the zipper eventually gives out.  This is a nice fleece sleep sack and so far the zipper works!  The fleece is a little different from older versions, but fine.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",It is very soft. But large for new born baby.  Also recommended .the price is also good for the quality,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Love this product! My son will not stay swaddled and this keeps him warm through the night. I also don\'t have to worry about it getting wrapped around his face. So much safer and easier!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I have loved these for keeping my babies warm without having to worry about suffocation with a blanket or anything.  I\'ve used these with all 3 of my kiddos.  I could never find a size above a small for my first two kids, but I was glad to find these online in medium and large for my 3rd baby.  I have to say that the size chart should really go by height rather than weight, though.  My son has outgrown his size small but looking at the sizing chart, I suspected he was getting close in weight to the large size range, and having never found them in store, I had no idea how large it would be. So I just bought a large instead of a medium so he wouldn\'t outgrow that in a month. Well, the large is massive, haha.  My 3-year-old who is around 39"" tall could easily wear this if she wasn\'t going to get out of bed and have to run to the potty quick or something, lol. So I have tried my son in the large anyway, and it doesn\'t seem to ride up over his face or anything.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We love these sleepsacks and intend to use them until our son outgrows all the sizes.  It is great to know that he at least will have the sleepsack on after he kicks off everything else during the night.  Our house is kept at cooler temps., so we use this each night over our pjs, except in the summer months. The large was a good choice for our 16 month old, too.  I am very happy with the product!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My son is 10months old and I was concerned about several things when sleeping. The sleep sack solves them all. He stays warm at night. I sleep at ease knowing he is safer without loose blankets. The sleep sack will not allow him to get his leg up and over the crib rail so....no risk of falling out.  Normally sleep sack are used for newborns but now I know they are great for older babies and toddlers as well.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",I decided to buy this because swaddling wasn\'t working anymore. I wanted the sack over the swaddler because I wanted my little guy to have his arms free. It\'s perfect for bedtime. I don\'t have to worry about baby kicking off his blanket.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This was a must have item in our house and we highly recommend it for those with children under 3 years old.Our daughter wore her HALO SleepSacks through age 2 and a half. She couldn\'t sleep without it. The blanket kept her warm of course because it couldn\'t be kicked off. She liked the \'weight\' of it on her (it is not heavy, but just having the layer on top of her helped her).When she began to stand and walk the sack did not stop her. She easily maneuvered around in her crib without hesitation or issue. She even wore the sack in the Pennsylvania summer months when the air conditioning was on...just wore her diaper and a t-shirt underneath.This also helped with diaper changes. It unzips from the bottom (as well as the top) so that you can keep your youngen\' warm in the middle of the night by just unzipping the bottom to change a diaper--keeping the top vest on and baby comfy!I wish I had this option for my other two when they were younger!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",It is really a great idea this speepSack. I do not have to worry of SIDS with my newborn. I really recommend this product.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My 1yo daughter has to wear a hip abduction brace at night, and it fits perfectly in this sleep sack. Absolutely awesome.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","These are fantastic. We have twin boys and we use these sleep sacks every night. I use them for bed with a long sleeve onesie, they sleep comfortably and warm.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Those little legs can get chilly in a onesie, so he likes to wear his sleep sack for lounging around. He can play on his play mat and do tummy time with this on, still kicks his legs with no problem. When I unzip it to change his diaper his legs are always nice and toasty warm. Obviously great for sleeping too.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We\'re very happy with this sleep sack.  The fleece is substantial and has washed well.  The zipper is good quality and hasn\'t stuck or separated.  The color is very close to the image online.  Luckily, it also fits well.  Our 8 month old crawls all over and practices standing all the time while in the crib in his sleep sack before and after sleeping with no range of motion impediment.The size chart was not available on the Amazon.  [...]",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Soft and warm, easy to wear .But after my baby can and likes to stand up, I stop using it since he may trip over. I will use it again when he can stand more steadily.",4
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","nice and long... I thought we were out of luck when my son grew out of his swaddle, but this sleep sack made the transition GREAT!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My baby loves his sleep sack.  He has been sleeping in some sort of sleep sack (swaddle type) since day one.  He can stand up and still move around comfortably in this one and it\'s great for chilly nights.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that\'s about it.  The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use.  It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she\'s come out of it.  I regret this purchase.",1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I can not say enough about Halo sleep sacks! We are now on our second child and I couldn\'t live without them. Niether one liked to be swaddled, so this is a safe way to make sure that they stay warm and comfy!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","When the sleep sack arrived, it smelled strongly of moth balls.  After two washes, the smell was still so strong that I was not willing to put the sack on my baby.  I returned the item & ordered another color, hoping that the weird smell was a fluke.  It was not a fluke.  The replacement sack smelled just as badly as the first one.  Though I typically love Amazon & order from them on pretty much a weekly basis, I cannot recommend buying this product from Amazon.  Unfortunately, I\'ll be making a trip to another store to purchase this item in the future rather than enjoying the convenience of ordering from Amazon.",1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",This is a super cute SleepSack and really keeps my 18mos warm.  Her room is so cold and this definitely takes the chill away!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My daughter has been sleeping in halo wearable blankets since she was a newborn and I have been very happy with both the fleece and cotton versions. The newborn swaddle version was also wonderful, but the velcro on the swaddle ""wings"" did quite a bit of damage in the wash until I got smart and put it inside a laundry bag. I have had no trouble with the sleeveless versions and they have held up very nicely in the wash. The halo fleece is better quality than the less expensive Carter\'s sleep sacks. My baby sleeps comfortably in our 68-70 degree home wearing a long sleeve footed sleeper plus a halo fleece wearable blanket. The cotton is a good alternative for warmer nights and/or nap times. The sizing charts seem to be accurate. Our baby is 27"" long and just over 16 pounds. She can still fit in her size small and can also wear her new size mediums, which have plenty of growing room.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We have tried so many different sleeping bags but have found the Halo SleepSack to be the best. Bub sleeps like a dream all year round in these.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We have used these since day one with our darling daughter.  She has had every size and is now 21 months.  We never worry about her kicking off her blankets and getting cold.  We know she is always protected and snugly.  Great product and worth every penny!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I am grandma and baby\'s parents requested this by name. Works very well, washes and wears well, easy to use.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",This worked so well with young and older baby. No worries about blankets or child getting cold. I slept better knowing he was safe and comfortable. It was also easy to unzip and change his diaper without removing the whole thing.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Nice mid-weight fleece. like that there is room for little feet to move. fits well around the neck. But a few times the zipper has come apart at the top when it is zipped up. I had the same issue with another Halo sleepsack. seems like a low quality zipper for a high priced item.,3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I discovered the Halo sleep sacks with my first baby and it was a dream come true.  My son is a very restless sleeper and would kick off all his blankets and then wake up because he was cold.  The sleep sack has kept him warm and sleeping for much longer stretches.I only wish I had discovered it sooner.Also, for parents concerned with SIDS (who isn\'t?) it is a huge relief not to worry about your baby suffocating on this blanket.I enthusiasitacally recommend this product and have bought them for many friends having babies.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We love this product! We have used these ever since my son stopped being swaddled at 4.5 months. Great product.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I ordered these sleepsacks for my 4 month old and love them.  They zip down instead of up so the zipper does not scratch or irritate your little one\'s neck.  (All baby clothes should be made this way.)  They are soft and comfy, and wash up really well.  They seemed a little expensive at first, but blankets are just as expensive and are not safe for your baby.  They are worth the investment and are good quality.  I ordered them in the next two sizes up for future use.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I am on my second child, neither of which would sleep through the night until I used these.  No more kicked off blankets.  Plus I dont have to worry about blankets in the crib.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We went on a vacation to a colder weather and this was perfect to keep our baby cozy. I highly recommend it.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Lightweight. Fits well. LOVE that it zips from the bottom for easy diaper changes. My daughter wears this every night.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My dtr has been wearing these blankets for a long time now and we absolutely LOVE them! She has always been a mover, wiggling around in the crib at night and unable to keep covers on. These stay on no problem and without getting all tangled up around her with risk for suffocation. We\'ve had multiple sizes, colors, and both the fleece and cotten and have used them all. For the winter she usually uses a heavier footed pj and the lightweight cotton blanket but sometimes a lighter footless pj with the fleece blanket. My dtr is now almost two and does occasionally take and unzip it...but not often enough yet that we\'ve had to stop using them. They definately are the main reason we have been able to keep her in a crib....I know that once we stop using these blankets she is sure to figure out how to climb out of the crib!! I wish there was a way to ""lock"" or childproof the zippers!!!  All of the blankets we have used from Halo have held up great until this last one. Our XL cotton blanket is just now ripping at the seams but I know it has withstood much abuse from all the kicking around she does at night! We\'ve also used this blanket the longest so I still give them 5 stars!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We love co-sleeping. But there comes a time when baby gets uncomfortable and needs their own sleeping space. However I had to figure out how to keep baby warm at night because they wouldn\'t have my body heat and I don\'t want to use blankets as I don\'t want my infant to suffocate (I know someone whose 9-month-old got tangled in a blanket and died). My son was waking up and so so cold, even while wearing his footed, fleece sleepers. One night I put clothes on under his fleece sleeper and it occurred to me that I should look into these sleepsacks I\'ve heard about. These HALO sleepsacks are absolutely amazing. They keep him warm and safe. My baby is 11-months and can still wake me at night because of teething or whatever but for the most part he stays asleep because he is warm. I got two pairs, one to use while the other is washing, but I\'d recommend having 3-4. The reason being that if baby sleeps through the night and gets a pretty full diaper these do absorb that funky ammonia smell more than other fabrics so they do need to be washed after every use. If your baby still wakes and gets changed in the middle of the night it\'s not as big an issue. Better to have too many than too few.We got size MEDIUM when my son was 9-10 months old. He is now 11-months-old and they still fit with some room to grow. He\'s of average size for his age. Hope that helps!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This wearable blanket is a lifesaver in our house because our house is very old and drafty.  It\'s a challenge to keep blankets on my son at his age, so this just gives me peace of mind knowing that he\'s going to stay warm and snuggled while wearing this.  He also loves the fleece texture of it which is an added bonus.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My daughter is 7m old and I got a L. It fits good and there is no need to buy smaller sizes unless you have a newborn, I would think. I wish I had bought one a long time ago. I didn\'t know about these when I had my first baby.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Light, breathable blanket. I like it better than the smaller one that secures baby\'s arms with Velcro. I only wish the zipper was NOT starting on top. This totally sucks, because you have to connect it every time instead of just sliding up if it was sewn to the bottom.",4
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This is a nice, cozy fleece sleep sack for the winter months.  My son sleeps well in these esp. since we can\'t use blankets in the cribs these days.  I love the puppy dog print on this one:).  Very cute!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We love these. We have several Halo sleepsacks and have had 2 boys spend their first months sleeping in them.  Not much to review about the product itself except that they worked well and nothing wore ever out.Two comments - everything I\'ve ever seen indicates that sleepsacks like these are much safer than loose blankets, so please consider if you\'re on the fence.  Second, we had one that had velcro ""wings"" that could be fastened to simulate a swaddle... garbage.  It didn\'t work at all and actually the velcro straps rode up around our first sons\' neck in a way that was pretty worrisome.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Our Grandson loves it. He has been sleeping through the night ever since he got it.We love the open arm holes for breathability and the way it zippers open from bottom to top for ease of diaper changing.His Mommy and daddy love it too! They are sleeping better.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I bought two of these in different colors for my daughter, and they are awesome. I was originally using regular blankets, but she would almost always kick them off and she is still too young to know how to cover herself up again (she\'s almost 7 months now). That problem was very easily resolved with these!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I was just looking at my order history, and realized I got this not that long ago.  Honestly this is in such poor shape after just a few months that I had assumed a friend gave it to me.  The zipper twists out of its socket (fixable but annoying) and the material is totally pilling.  I have loved Halo stuff but am not happy about this particular purchase.",3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",The sleep sack arrived in original packaging and has been a great fit for our baby. The sleep sack works great and washes easily.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This does an excellent job of keeping my baby warm while also being safer than blankets in the crib. I like that I can still use the adorable sleepers I bought and just put this over them. The zipper seems sturdy enough (it is metal), and I like that it unzips from the bottom for easier diaper changes.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",These sleep sacks work great for our baby.  The fleece helped keep him warm through the winter.  We haven\'t had any problems with HALO brand and would recommend it to anyone.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Easy to put on, and it stays on all night. My daughter kicks all her blankets off within 15 minutes, so this thing helps so much. Also, she loves the feel of it as it is nice and soft. Will buy more!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",I was excited about exclusively using these for my baby girl but I had two problems with the product. From birthit was hard to get her little arms in and out if the holes. It doesn\'t allow for the same flexibility as a shirt.Also when I wanted to pick her up the metal part of the zipper would touch her face. It would have been better for this part to be a different material.Because of thes features it was uncomfortable for us both. I now have 3 due to registry and my own excitement to purchase. All have seen little use.UpdateJust purchase the bigger sizes. I think it helps.I now have a sleepsack from Ikea and like it much better. I love how it zips in a kimono style from top to bottom. I can open the bottom half way if she gets too long so that her feet can stick out from the bottom and with the kimono style I can stretch it to fit her arms better than this.,3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",All sizes of the SleepSack are available at BabiesRus.com. You should also try the new SleepSack swaddle if you want to swaddle your baby easily. It turns into a regular SleepSack when swaddling is no longer needed/wanted.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Love the Halo sleep sacks. Have been using on my 9 month old since he was a newborn. I love the gender neutral colors so I can hopefully use on future children. I find these an essential staple for babies.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My daughter lived in these between 3 and 8 months. They\'re great for when your baby no longer wants to be swaddled but still needs extra warmth without the bulk of blankets.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",These are great!  Our triplet girls have been wearing these sleepsacks for bedtime and naps since we brought them home from the hospital.  They were so easy for sleepy parents to use during midnight diaper changes.  We have gone through the newborn and small size and are about to buy the next size up because they work so well.  We also don\'t have the constant worry about SIDS issues like we would with blankets.  We highly recommend these for any new parent.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital.  Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets.  He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old.  I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security.  He was never able to sleep without being in it.  He is now 30 months old and still won\'t go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack.  We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it.  That is how much he loves his sleep sack.  It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I love the Halo sleepsacks. This is not a swaddle sack, so don\'t get confused! The swaddle sacks were pretty worthless for my Houdini baby, but once we broke him of the swaddle I started using these Halo wearable blanket sacks. They are the perfect weight for cooler nights, and they hold up through many washes and wears.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My grandson will not sleep without it. Allows you not to use a real blanket, thus maybe preventing SIDS. Easy to wash.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My little boy has slept in sleep sacks since he was about two weeks old. At 19 months, he still loves his sleep sack. It is cozy and I don\'t have to worry about him kicking it off in the middle of the night. It would be great it they made this style in even longer lengths. I don\'t care for the footed style Sleep Sack. I want to make sure that his feet stay warm thoughout the night.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My son loves this sleep sack.  It\'s very thick and warm.  Also super soft and cozy!  Great to find one in a larger size too!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",This is perfect. All the perks of a blanket without worrying about him choking. Zips from the bottom up so midnight diaper changes are a breeze. I have 2 microfleece & 1 cotton for when he\'s wearing thick PJs.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Micro-fleece fabric pills and quickly becomes coarse. These are well priced and do the job fine, but I\'ve since switched over to baby Deedee sleep sacks (better quality, but also quite a bit more costly).",3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This product is a must for any baby like mine who rolls around in their crib all night long. He stays nice and warm, but you don\'t have to worry about him getting tangled in blankets or getting cold.  we had a size medium, and i wanted more but wanted to get the next size up so they would last a while. well they will last a REALLY long while, as the size large is really big. i have a taller than average boy and its really roomy on him. but this is a great product. i have 4. 2 cold weather, 2 light cotton for warmer weather. they are AWESOME!!!",4
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My 6 month old kept kicking off his blankets, so the sleep sack has helped a lot. The sizing is a little funny, see other reviews for more details to help you get the right size. It\'s winter now, which makes the fleece great, but in summer it would definitely be too hot.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",I bought this thing over a year ago and my kid still sleeps in it.  You never have to worry about blankets going over his face. he sleeps like a dream in it,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This really helped our baby sleep better. Made her feel safe and secure, so she slept longer. Can\'t say enough. This is a Must Have.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",I used sleep sacks for both my kids until they outgrew them. I like the heavy fleece ones for the winter. Since my babies have used from about 3 mos. old they never knew any different and love them. Also a good consistent signal for sleep or nap time. They can both walk in them too easily the few times they escaped the bed while wearing them. I don\'t understand why people are concerned about falling and tripping in the bed in these.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I\'ve owned the medium, large and now extra large version of this blanket.  Excellent product.  I haven\'t had any problems with the zipper or other components.These blankets tend to be on the large size because they cover a range of about 10 lbs of weight (26 to 36 lbs., for instance).  Some people seem to have experienced problems with that.  Definitely pay attention to the sizing and expect a larger blanket.  Don\'t worry; babies grow into them.  A little extra room is good for a growing child.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Our son started sleeping thru the night once we started using the sleep sack.  We swaddled him for the first 3 months but once he became a little stronger he was able to break out in the middle of the night.  He would kick covers off and get cold in the middle of the night causeing him to wake up.  Once we started using the sleep sack he started sleeping all night.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This wearable blanket is great!  In response to other comments, the sleepsack did cover my son\'s mouth and nose a sometimes but it was because I put him in one too large.  The smaller one was fantastic and he grew into the other one.  Also, these are ""blankets"" not pajamas.  At night I put my son in long sleeved, long pants pjs and he does just fine.  I like that it has no sleeves for during the day and in hot weather where I let him wear short sleeves when sleeping.  I like knowing he is always covered and I don\'t have to worry.  It also helps keep his feet/legs from getting stuck in the crib slats.  This is a great product.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Love these sleep sacs!  Have the cotton version also and bought these for the cooler nights as we get closer to winter!  Have now purchased for baby shower gifts.  A must have for after your baby has outgrown being swaddled.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My son rolls around A LOT in his crib during naptime and at bedtime, and it\'s impossible to keep a blanket on him! We received one of these as a gift for him in size small, and I\'ve loved it so much, I keep buying the larger size when he outgrows the prior one. I definitely recommend this for babies who are physically active in their sleep. :)",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Good price and a warm blanket for my son.  What more do you need?  My son hasn\'t wiggled out of it and it\'s super warm.  I would definitely purchase another.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Love these SleepSacks!  My son would constantly break out of the swaddle, so we tried these when it was getting ridiculous!  He loved them and slept so much better.  Now we can\'t live without them.  I just put him in a long sleeve onesie and the sleepsack as our house is quite warm.  He never complains and sleeps through the night.  Am curious about the quilted ones.  Could be a perfect mix of the cotton and the fleece (which can sometimes be a bit sweaty!).",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size.  My son is at the top end of the size large weight range, but this item will still fit him for many months.  Instead, look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination.  My tall son is growing out of size 18-24 month clothing, but the size large sleepsack (size 12-18 months) will fit him for many more months.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Halo, how I love thee;) This is perfect for cold winter nights. We keep the heater off due to allergries and bundle up our little guy. He\'s snug as a bug.",5

This is perfect for her sleeping as we just put a long sleeve shirt underneath. I got her a medium even though she is only 12 lbs it fits great up top and has plenty of width to accommodate her brace over her legs.Thanks!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",These sleep sacks seem to be nice and warm and of good quality. We\'ve been sing ten for about a month and they wash nice an look comfy.,5

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Love this blanket.  Very soft and warm.  Easy to put on your baby but the most important feature is its safety.  I am French and everybody in France has given up blankets and started using this type of blanket/bag.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",This was way better than I expected for the money.  Very soft and quite \'heavy\'.  I would have no issue at all putting my grandchild in this to sleep without any additional coverings at all.  Very very soft and lots of room for him to kick his legs.  Love it.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Keeps my little guy warm on cold nights, so we don\'t have to crank up the heat too high.  Nice and soft, easy to put on, stays on all night.",4

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Purchased two of these and two light green ones for twin granddaughters who will be here any day now.  They look so cozy and are great for babies because they can\'t kick off their blanket!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Worked well for my daughter even though she was able to get her hands of of many swaddles. This one seemed to hold her in pretty tight.,4
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Got this for my 14 month old when it started to get cold out to help keep her warm at night since she couldn\'t keep covered at night with blankets and would wake up cold. Keeps her nice and warm, has room to grow in it too which is a plus!",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My son has been using the Halo sleep sacks (swaddle sack until he was 6 months) since he was born.  We love them, the fleece is warm enough for winter and we never have to worry that he is cold.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Although I was very pleased with the convertible swaddle/sleep-sack, at this age (9 months and up) the reverse zipper is unnecessary. I guess if you are still having a baby wake several times with a soiled diaper it would be helpful, but if not, it makes it just difficult to put on a little boy is starting to exert his own desires (and doesn\'t always have patience for me to get the zipper in place). The product is well made and very cute, but I\'m going to try the Dream Bag USABaby Sleeping Bag Farmyard Friends 6-18 Months 1.0 TOGwhich also has different warmth options. That was the second reason I started looking at other sleep sack options. My son was sweating in fleece with the summer heat warming his room up during the day. My baby gets hot easily. I\'ll have to review that product once we have used it a few nights.",3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My daughter loves her sleep sacks.  She was swaddled for almost six months and then we transitioned to the sleep sack.  It took a few nights, but she finally got it - and now she loves it.  In addition, we live in a colder climate and do not heat the house above 62 degrees at night, so combined with a little heater, this sleep sack does the trick.I have tried Aiden and Anais as well as Grobag.  I find neither to compare to the functionality, the longevity and the simplicity of the HALO.  We have this sleep sack in fleece as well as cotton, depending on the temperature.  We have not even gotten the early walker yet and this works just fine.  Ultimately, when we put her in the sleep sack, it\'s time for bed and there will be no more walking anyway, so this works just fine for us!Highly recommend.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Great product!  Good for young kids that don\'t use blankets. This product stands up to a lot of wear and tear.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","The halo sleepsack works well but there are two things to consider. It runs larger than the summer brand and unlike the summer brand it only zips from top to bottom. The Summer brand has two zippers so you can zip both ways. Otherwise it is a great purchase since for the baby\'s safety you shouldn\'t put loose blankets in the crib. Better yet, no cold feet  b/c little one can\'t kick off the covers. Get 2, just so you have an extra for those middle of the night diaper accidents. Also it\'s helpful to have one in regular cotton and one in fleece so you can make sure baby isn\'t too hot depending on the night and the thickness of the pjs underneath.",4
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Love the wearable blanket. Works perfect for the winter month. Little one is always warm in his blanket. Love it!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Smat would be it\'s a bit of a pain to remove the seat for washing and my baby spits up a good bit so it get\'s washed a lot.  That being said it is still very bright despite frequent wahings and I am honestly not sure what you could do to improve upon the design.  My daughter really enjoys each toy on this item and it\'s easy for me to sit with her and play along.  The seat seems to support her well also.",4,
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I registered for this toy on the enthusiastic recommendation of a mother in Babies R Us.  I am so glad that I did!  My son loves it.  He plays with all of the brightly colored and visually stimulating toys, but the sound box is his favorite.  He enjoys the animal sounds and the music that each one plays.  He looks so pleased with himself when he gets it to play!  Our little man loves to bounce and, since we took the supports off the bottom, he can rock the saucer and turn and really move around.  This is good because he hated the swing, carseat and such because they confined his movement too much.  I enthusiastically recommend this toy for active babies and moms who need a safe place to entertain baby while they do chores.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"Great product.  My baby loves it.  She will play in it for a good hour.  She especially loves the electronic attachment that makes the animal sounds.  There are also plenty of things to chew on for the teething baby.  I put extra little toys in the extra spaces, too  I\'m very glad I ordered this product!",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is an absolute baby ""must have"".  We bought this for our daughter about 6 weeks ago and she still loves this.  I put her there to cook dinner or clean up or whatever.  Maggie is 5 1/2 months now and small for her age, but this is a good a fit for her and she seems very comfortable.  She spins around and plays with all the toys.  The safety concerns with the toys have been addressed by the company-mine did not have any strings or tassels attatched or ""beads"" spilling out of the puppet.  I guess it was redesigned after complaints.  I would highly reccomend this toy.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,I have a 6 month old and she really enjoys time spent in the activity center.  I like this product because it allows for exploration and it gives me a few minutes to get dinner made!,4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My baby loves the activity center and is able to spin around freely, however, the legs to hold it stationary will not stay put and a few of the toys have broken off.  Overall, it\'s a pretty good product.",3
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"We bought this for our 6-month-old son not because of the ""Baby Einstein"" brand, but because it only had one battery-powered feature out of nine items around the circle for him to play with.  Our son had not really taken to many ""gadgets"", i.e. his bouncy seat, swing, etc. until we bought this.  It keeps his attention, he can chew on most of the toys (a big plus as he is teething) and he always smiles when we put him in it.One (wierd) aside, the triangle top on the three-shaped stacked toy has a realistic picture of a fire-engine on it with engine number ""69"" prominently displayed on its front.  Maybe this is just my adult mind running wild, but is this some kind of sick joke by the company, or only a coincidence???  I didn\'t find it funny, or cute, or however they intended it or not...Other than that negative, it is well designed and our son loves it.",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"We just purchased the B.E. for our 5 month old son.  He LOVES it. Although there are less activities than other saucers, the quality of the activities is much better.  The use of primary colors (red, blue, yellow and green) keeps it stimulating yet not overwhelming.  As a teacher of young children, I liked the fact that the saucer does not rely too heavily on electronic activities.  The puppet encourages creativity, while the other activities stimulate motor and cognitive skills.  If you\'re only purchasing one entertainment system for your child, this would be the one to go with!",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I have twins and we have both the Exersaucer Ultra and the Baby Einstein Entertainer (Christmas presents).  The Exersaucer took me almost on hour to assemble, while the Baby EIntein took only about half the time to assemble.  ALthough at 6 months, my twins do not give us their opinion per say, they seem to really like the toys much better on the Baby Einstein, although the Exersaucer has many more toys.  The quality of the toys on the Baby EInstein is far superior to the Exersaucer.  They absolutely LOVE the toy with the buttons that plays music, flashes lights and makes animal sounds.  The other toys, too are also played with a lot.  They still like the exersaucer, but I know if hey could speak, they would say they like the Baby Einsten Entertainment center better.Addendum - My twins are now 9 months old, so I wanted to give you all an update now that we have used both entertainment centers for the past 4 months.  The twins still love both saucers.  Both have held up well over time - no damaged toys under heavy use.  The Exersaucer Ultra\'s seat is much easier to remove to wash (and both seats need frequent washing!).  The twins do seem to correlate the toys on the Baby Einstein Center with the Baby Einstin videos.  Although the toys on the Baby Eintein Entertainment Center are overall superior, the Exersaucer Ultra the twins have found have one major advantage - the Exersaucer BOUNCES!!  Both babies go to town  bouncing away -  I mean like a pogo stick!!  They try to bounce the Baby EInstein  Center, but it is not nearly as accomadating.  It is nice to be fortunate enough to have two saucers so the twins have the variety and advantage of both.  Perhaps the Baby Einstein Company will consider this for next generation Center.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"We registered for the Discover & Play Activity Center and got it at our baby shower. We were delighted the day that our daughter could sit up to use it! She instantly fell in love with the animal sounds, the chewable parts and the noises she could make on the wheel! We loved how it keeps her entertained and allowes her to movement she so despratly craves at 7 months old! I am however disappointed with how it is holding up over time. We have been using it for 3 weeks now and the seat is beginning to rip, the red support legs that are supposed to keep it stable are giving way, and the strings on the top of the triangle are falliing apart and we had to detangle our daughter from them. I am surprised and diappointed in how quickly it is wearing out, after only 3 weeks of use! We love the educational part of it, but if it doesn\'t hold up we will be forced to purchase a new activity center and for $80 I would think it would be stronger and more baby proff.",3
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My 5 mo. old loves it!  The only toy he has problems with is the book.  The pages are hard to turn.  He plays with every toy on it, though.  When he first started playing in it, he would stare at the sun and play with the rollers, but now he plays with everything.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,This product saved me!  I used to spend all my time trying to entertain my baby even while I was cleaning around the house.  Now that I have the Baby Einstein caterpillar I can get up to 30 minutes to myself to clean around without having to worry if she is being stimulated enough.  I wasn\'t crazy about the dragon puppet so I took it off but everything else she loves.,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My daughter who is 8 months old gets somewhat bored with this exer saucer.  Which for the price, name, and reputation was  disappointing.  She also gets her little fingers scratched badly when she uses it.  I am still trying to figure out which toy on the exer saucer is doing the scratching.  I wish I would of tried out some other brands in the store.",3
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"Overall we are happy with the purchase.  Each week our daughter seems to discover something new about the toys and is captivated once again.  The animal noise maker is a big hit and the noise/music is not annoying like some toys, plus it can be turned off which is a great feature.  The only complaint I have is that one of the red stabilizer feet that keep the saucer from rocking broke after only a month (I would guess it was less than 10 hours of play time).  We have to prop up one side with a book when we don\'t want her rocking.",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is a wonderful toy. Our 7 month old daughter has been enjoying this since she turned 4 months old.  We bought it because she loved the ones similar to it at her day care.  She is entertained  for upwards of 30 minutes.  It is sturdy and I feel very comforable with her in it. There is plenty of room to grow but still gives her stabilizing support while she learns to balance and support her upper body.  It was more expensive than most of the others but the quality of this product is well worth it.  I have washed the seat a number of times and I clean it with lysol and it shows NO signs of wear at all, its like new!",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I have twins and let me tell you, they LOVE this activity center.  They love to play with each toy/activity.  The seat spins around so that they can get to each item.  It keeps them very busy.  It has helped their motor skills tremendously.  A must have for all babies.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,I would recommend this product to parents.  Baby Einstein always has great products and my little boy loves his entertainer.  He likes the bright colors and the Bard the Dragon puppet is his favorite.,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 5 mos.  She instantly fell in love.  I looked at several different types before purchasing anything.  This one had everthing I wanted.  When older kids come over they want her to get in so they can play with it and her.  I thought it was expensive for such a short-term toy, but I am very pleased with our purchase.  It is worth the money",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is the one of the best things we\'ve bought our baby. She absolutely loves it. She will stay in it playing for long periods of time without getting bored. It\'s the only thing I can put my baby in that will give me time to do other things around the house. She\'s even tired of the swing and bouncy seat. We got it when she was only 4 months old, and even at that young age, we could adjust it so her feet could reach the bottom. We slowly over the days watched her become more and more interested and interactive w/the toys. All of the toys are safe and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this over the exersaucers as I have had friends who haven\'t been as pleased with those. This is definitely worth every penny!!",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I bought this exersaucer for my 6 month old daughter who has down syndrome. The quality is good and the variety of toys attached are really nice. Kyley was uncertain at first, but after a few weeks started enjoying it more.  Now at seven months she likes it a lot and it has helped strengthen her legs.  I think this a product that will continue to be enjoyed by her as she gets older.  Kyley is not small for her age and a few of the objects are hard for her to reach at this time.  Overall a well made product.",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,This is well worth the money! My daughter loves this and it keeps her entertained for a long time!!,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I am still researching what to get for my 5 month old daughter. I\'ve narrowed it down and now am debating on this activity center and the Jumperoo. What does anyone recommend? Since they do two different things, I don\'t know if that\'s a fair comparison. I just would like someone\'s opinion on which is better and the baby would be able to enjoy longer. Thanks!!",3
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"As with other Baby Einstein products, I am pleased with this one. My son loves it. There weren\'t many toys that he was interested in until we purhased this. He will sit quietly and play and, he will even watch t.v. from it.The great thing about this center is it grows with your child, having 3 different heights so, you get maximum use. There are 5 animal sounds and, the names of the animals are told in English and Spanish, a little photo album with 4 different animals, a dragon puppet and, much more. In all there are 9 little activites, in a circle around your child. And, your child can turn the seat, for complete access to each of them. This is well worth the price!",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I put my daughter in the Baby Einstein activity Center when she was 3 months old, and she becomes increasingly more entertained the older she gets. I like that the table has room for smaller toys she can pick up and chew on, as well as leaving her to stand, which she loves to do. HOWEVER....the electronic/musical portion of the toy worked for about a week and then shorted out.  We improvised by removing it from the activity center, which my daughter doesn\'t even notice, and my 4 year old son likes to take apart the defunct musical toy and look inside at the wires, so I guess everybody wins, but STILL...I would have liked for my daughter to get that experience of pressing buttons that light up and make animal sounds.",3
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,Our 5-month old daughter loves her Baby Einstein Excer-Saucer!  Just seeing her face light up as she whacks the animal buttons to hear their noises and watching her turn herself around is priceless! A definite must-have!,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"We bought this for our daughter who turns 6 months old in May.  At first when we put her in it, when she was 3-4 months old, her little feet barely tapped the bottom of the saucer and she really didn\'t play with anything.  Now that she\'s getting older and is able to grab at things with more control, she LOVES this thing and will sit in it for hours at a time.  She grabs at things, sticks them in her mouth and can completely turn around in it now!It works really well when she wants to play, but we\'re busy with dinner or housework.  It\'s really nice because it doesn\'t move, or roll, so there\'s no worry about stairs or anything.  When she gets taller, it\'s nice that the height of this toy is adjustable too.GREAT PRODUCT",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My daughter has been using this since she was almost 4 months old, and 4 months later, she still loves it.  My only complaint is that the ""book"" pages are a little hard for her to turn. This does not seem to frustrate her, she eventually gets it just right, or moves on to another toy.  She loves to manipulate all of the toys.  There are plenty of soft textures for her to chew on, and the harder toys are well designed so they do not scratch her or hurt her gums.  She seemed to recognize the dragon from the video and laughed when I said ""blah!!!!"" while moving the puppet.  She learns cause and effect with the noise-makers. It will be interesting to see if she uses ""vaca"", ""perro"", ""pato"" and ""leon"" instead of their English counterparts when she begins to talk. It is fairly easy to carry the saucer up or down stairs, depending on which room I need it in.Update- my daughter is 15 months old and still enjoys this toy.  However, when she was learning to stand, it was a little tipsy.  Also, the braces that pull out to make it more steady are a little jagged, so when she crawled underneath it sometimes they would scratch her.  Still a good toy, though!",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,We bought this for our 7 mo. son. He\'s had it for a month and still loves to play in it! I chose this one because my son is in the 95th percentile for both height and weight and this activity center will last longer than many others I have looked at. And it\'s easy to clean. I highly recommend this!!,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I thoroughly researched exersaucer online before going to the store to purchase one. The one I originally selected is no longer being made, so I found the Baby Einstein one in the store. I liked the colorful toys and the learning activities on it, so I got it for my son.He\'s still a little young for it, but we put him in it for a little while each day. And though he doesn\'t have the hand coordination to play with everything yet, he loves to look at the colorful sun toy and the yellow, blue, and green rolling toys. I can\'t wait for him to be able to play with all of the toys on it, and I think this exersaucer far surpasses the others.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My son has been of the opinion that he should be walking since he was three months old which has led to hours of holding him upright and very tired arms for Mommy!  He has a jumperoo, which he loves, however he tires in it after 10-15 minutes.  My husband and I took him to Babiesrus to ""test drive"" the various entertainers and he immediately took to the Baby Einstein one.  It may have simply been recognition due to the DVD\'s and toys he has with the same characters but he definitely preferred this to the others.  We got it home and put it together and plopped him in...definitely still loves it!  He\'ll happily entertain himself for 45 minutes and loves that he can stand and watch everything around him!  He loves ""slapping"" the animals and hearing what sounds they make and he is mesmerized by the plush sunshine that he likes to bat at and ""talk"" to.  It\'s relieved my arms and satisfied his urge to scootaround and ""walk"".  He also loves watching his DVD\'s while in it and it makes reading to him so much easier...he can play and stand while looking at the pages of the books.  Definitely worth every penny!  We\'ve been nothing but impressed with the Baby Einstein products.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"my granddaughter, Lucy is 7 months, 22 lbs and 2\'4"" tall. carrying her is quite a workout for me. i can pop her in the baby einstein and she and i can play face to face. we especially like the music. Lucy hits the animal till there is music and waits to see what her silly nana does. i wish they had these when my girls were growing up.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"The design is simple, the toys are not interchangable, but my son goes NUTS in this thing!  We tried the more expensive Exersaucer and he couldn\'t be in it more than 5 minutes before growing tired of it.  At 4 months he doesn\'t completely ""fill"" the seat yet and the height is at the lowest setting so he will definitely grow into this.The toys are creative and the layout is appealing allowing little one to enjoy each toy fully.  The colors are vibrant and complementary.  The materials are high quality and interesting to the touch.Don\'t be fooled by the simplistic look of this toy, Graco/Baby E know what they are doing.  This play center is a winner!",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,Our little one is 5 1/2 months old and just LOVES it.  She was so excited she did not know what to touch and play with first!  I would definately recommend this to anyone!,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"We got this for her at 3 and half months.  We had a playmat, but she was rolling over and ending up on the floor so it was time to upgrade.  We looked at a bunch, some that had lots of little toys all over it, some that bounced, the leapfrog ones too.  I liked the look of the Baby Einstein, and already had videos to tie it in with.  In the store, we sat her in it, and instantly I could see that she was engaged.  She was just learning to master her grabbing technique and her eyes were intensely looking at the sun - which rattles!  She is now six months and is overjoyed with with all of the features of this toy.  From the three rollers that have different sounds (bells, beeds, and snappy sounds) to the puppet and sun that she likes to chew on, the globe she likes to spin, and finally the animal buttons.  Those are great, each time she touches the button it does something different.  The middle, which is a duck, quacks, on the first touch, then says ""duck"", on the second touch, says ""duck"" in spanish(pato), and third touch, plays classical music (each time the music comes on she smiles and wiggles!!).  The same idea applies for the other 4 buttons, which are a cow, dog, cat and lion.  A wonderful toy that fully engages your child, and as their mind develops, offers new perspective to the toys they were simply chewing on months before, soon she\'ll look through the little book they have and be able to identify the animals!  This was the best purchase I\'ve made for my baby, and it\'s was around $10 less then the Leapfrog toy.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"We got this as a gift at my baby shower and of the gifts we got, this is in the top 3, after the boppy pillow and bouncy chair.  My son loved this activity center! We started putting him in it when he was around 4 months old and used it almost everyday until he was about 7 months old. It has so many activities to entertain him and he never got bored with it until he learned how to crawl.  He loved pushing the buttons to make the animal sounds and the music play and spinning the wheels.  It\'s also nice that there aren\'t any sharp edges on the toys so he wouldn\'t hurt himself, unless some of the other activity centers/exersaucers.  The only complaint I have about it is that it\'s hard to take the seat off so you can wash it. You really have to pry it off.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I purchased this activity center a couple of months ago and my son loves it.  The only problem is when you need the activity center to stay stationary you need to push the legs down.  The product came with two defective legs.  I called Graco and they gladly sent me two new legs.  Within a week the third leg would not stay in position, again I contacted Graco and they sent me the third leg.  I would have given this product five stars if it wasn\'t for the leg issue.  I still recomment this product.",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My daughter just loves this toy but the legs keep collapsing, she is only 11 lbs. I have tried to contact the company about this but the e-mail keeps being returned - no such address, I used the e-mail on the Baby Einstein site itself. It\'s too bad really as she simply loved it but it is too dangerous for her to use.",1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I never got a chance to own this item.  It was shipped to me twice, and both times the packaging was damaged and parts were missing.  It was sent in the original carton, and not wrapped for shipping.",1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My daughter has a very basic Exersaucer type play center, and she loves it.  I got it at a lawn sale, and payed very little, so I decided I could afford to buy a second one so I didn\'t keep having to move the first one from room to room.  I looked over all the choices and decided I liked the look of this one best.  Well, that may be the case, but it was a NIGHTMARE to set up.  The manual seems to be written in some kind of minimalist style---with some instructions being literally one word---""Snap"" or the like.  It took 3 tries, but I got the basic setup down, and then went to install the toys.  To do so, for several of them, you have to put a screw through a tiny hole, line that screw up with a raised hole you can\'t see on a toy you are holding into place with the other hand, screw in the screw upside down into a hole that has no grooves, so you have to use force...you can guess I was in tears before long!  The toys that needed that done to them would just not go on tightly enough for me.  Because all baby toys come with dire warning about incorrect installation, I just decided I couldn\'t have those toys on at all.  Which isn\'t all bad, I like putting toys onto the saucer of my own, so Janey can fling them on the floor repeatedly.  However, the saucer also seems to be designed, as someone else mentioned, for tall babies.  She is 7 months old, although admittedly a bit petite, but well within normal ranges, and her feet just barely touch the bottom, and don\'t at all unless I have the feet pulled up, so she can lean a little.  I would hate to have gotten this when she was 4 months---it would have been unusable.That said, the toys I WAS able to use are enjoyable to her---she loves the globe, and the book with cat and dog pictures.  I like the somewhat mellow coloring compared to some toys.  The puppet is a bit bizarre looking, and the box calls him interactive--well, I guess all puppets are SORT of interactive, if you make them so by imagination, but that\'s the only way he is!I was deciding between this and the Leap Frog model mainly.  I wish I had gotten that one---I didn\'t because it was so electronic---but maybe it would have been better designed!",3
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"The first time I used your service was in August 2005.  I paid for 2 day delivery and the item took 2 weeks to be delivered.This time, when the original box was rec\'d it was totally opened and was refused due to the fact that parts were missing.The second time this package was delivered, the box was left in the back of the house with no note on the door.  We never rec\'d packages in the back of the house.  No one was home so no one even knew it was there.  Also, again the box was totally ripped and opened.  Only this time all the parts were there.  Either there is a problem with the packaging of the items or it is being totally destroyed during shipment.  Either way THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM and I AM TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH AMAZON.",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"While I have been very pleased with many Baby Einstein products - from videos, to books, play gyms, etc. -  I was extremely alarmed this evening when I sat down to play with my 6 month old son who was seated in the Exer-Saucer.  Upon inspection, I found that the plastic layer covering the pictures on the Shape Tower (square, cylinder, triangle) was flaking away!  I would expect that all the items on the Exer-Saucer should tolerate normal ""teething"".  We immediately removed the Shape Tower from the tray, but I am now concerned about the remaining items durability.  I want to like this product, however, I simply cannot knowing the potential choking/ingestion risk of the peeling/flaking plastic cover over the fire engine and apple pictures on the triangle.",1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is a lifesaver.  I originally purchased the Leap Frog Learning Station which my son absolutely loves, but he is a big boy.  At 30 inches and only 7 1/2 months, he has far outgrown the Leap Frog, so we needed something just as fun and educational that would work with his height.  Fortunately, this entertainer grows with your child up to 32 inches which still gives him time to play and learn.  All of the other enteratiners have a max height of 30 inches =(  I highly recommend this product especially if you have an above average child as we do!",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"MY BABY IS 4 MONTHS. SHE IMMEDIATELY LOVED IT. SHE STAYS IN THIS ACTIVITY CENTER MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRODUCT I HAVE. THIS PRODUCT WAS EASY TO ASSEMBLE.IT IS VERY COLORFUL AND ATTRACTS BABYS ATTENTION. THE ONLY PROBLEMS I INCOUNTERED WERE WITH THE BATTERY OPERATED TOY. THE SCREW DOESN,\'T COME OUT. I CALLED THE COMPANY AND THEY ARE SHIPPING OUT THE ENTIRE TOY FREE OF CHARGE. I AM NOT THRILLED EITHER ABOUT THE SPANISH TRANSLATION. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT, I WOULD PREFER ONLY ENGLISH. I SEEMED TO HAVE TROUBLE SNAPPING IN THE BOOK BUT I EVENTUALLY DID AFTER NUMEROUS TRIES.I DO SUGGEST THAT YOU KEEP THE BOX AND RECIEPT. IF ANYTHING BRAKES OR IS DEFECTIVE JUST CALL THE COMPANY AND THEY WILL TRY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM QUICKLY. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE TOY AND YOU SHOULD GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH.",4
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This morning our 11 month old granddaughter was in the activity center watching TV with my husband right next to her.  He noticed that she was choking.  To make a long story short, we did the back blows on her back and kept her tilted on her tummy upside down. Waiting for the paramedics to arrive a piece of cellophane finally came out of her mouth and she was okay.  After examining the play activity center we were horrified to discover that the piece of cellophane had come off of the 3 stack toy.  The cellophane covers the pictures on the toy and our granddaughter had picked the cellophane off and put it in her mouth.  We wanted to warn other users of this choking hazard.  This toy should be removed from the activity center immediately.  We will be contacting Graco, and everyone else that we can think of to get this problem resolved.  It makes us sick to think of what a senseless tradgedy could have occured, due the activity center that she enjoyed so much.",1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"There aren\'t enough toys to keep my baby interested. In addition, the seat cover is EXTREMELY difficult to put on and take out to wash. I returned this and payed an extra $20 for the Evenflo Exersaucer, which was well worth it!",3
Mini Co-Sleeper,"My husband and I bought this because our baby was born right before we would be moving back to the US. We are very happy with it as it makes traveling with a baby a breeze. We never have to worry if the hotel we\'re in provides cribs, or if they are safe for that matter. We have had it for almost three months now, using it exclusivly, and the only thing wrong is a small tear in the fabric.I had no trouble setting this up, however I did try it out before the baby came so I wasn\'t exhausted at the time. I don\'t think it would have gone the same if I was.I can\'t imagine what we would have done without this thing!",5
Mini Co-Sleeper,"I bought the co sleeper when I was still pregnant and was hoping it would help me through the long nights with a new baby.  It didnt.  I have to agree with the previous review about the mattress.  It\'s as thin and hard as a rock and my daughter wont sleep on it, no matter how tired she is. She\'s more comfortable in her car seat!  It\'s also very difficult to get the side rail down. My husband nearly broke it trying to lower it and it seemed like with the side rail down the mattress slanted towards the front, making it even more uncomfortable for my daughter.A waste of $165 in my opinion.",1
Mini Co-Sleeper,"I really like the size of this co-sleeper. It\'s perfect for having baby in our master bedroom without taking up a ton of room like a full-sized crib would do.  Seems very stable and durable and should work until baby is about 6 months old and ready to move to her own room.  Only complaint would be the leg extensions, which I needed because my bed is higher than average.  They seem a little shaky and I worry about breaking them off when I have to move the sleeper.",4
Arms Reach Mini CoSleeper White Canopy,"I purchased this crib tent to keep the cats out, as it seems most people do. What the other reviews said is true, the canopy will cave in if the cat climbs onto it. However for cats that are simply curious about exploring a potential new cozy spot to sleep, this does the trick. Our cats sniffed around it, pawed at the sides a bit, and then ignored it. So for us it\'s worked well. Now if we could just get our son to sleep in the co-sleeper we\'d be set.",4
Arms Reach Mini CoSleeper White Canopy,"I love my arms\' reach, but the canopy is a waste of $$, IMHO.  We got it only as an attempt to keep cats out of the co-sleeper, but as it turned out (tried it w/o baby in it, thankfully, lol!), cats\' weight just caved in the soft plastic ribbing.  Pointless for us.  Perhaps as a mosquito net it might work.  The added reaching through the opening made it very hard to get the baby out for feedings, so really, it was up for about 24 hours and we took it down and used the mobile over the changing table and the rest went into a closet, where it still sits today.  Sigh.  Just a gadget, not useful for us.  LOVE the co-sleeper though!  GREAT concept.  Co-sleeping w/o bedsharing makes even grouchy pediatricians on the AAP happy. ;)  Our babies still ended up in our bed most nights though, practicing Dr. James McKenna\'s Safer Bedsharing Guidelines... Exclusively breastfed, always sober, etc...  Good luck with your little love(s)!",2
Sevi Wooden Mobile Holder Natural Toy,"This mobile holder does not attach to my crib securely.  Also, as in the other review, the arm is not long enough, so any mobile will not be in the center of the crib, but off to the side rail.I would not recommend this product.",1
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This guard is very very good and dependable, and secure in its place like a wall, thanks to the under-the-mattress lock that extends and locks at the other side of bed, via a metal disk.We have had this for over a month now, and I can say that we made the right choice with this one. Assembly took all of ten minutes, and installation another five.I highly recommend this product.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I was looking for something sturdy, reasonably priced and safe as we were transitioning our 21 month old son from his crib to a twin bed.  This product certainly lived up to these 3 expectations!  Also, It folds down easily to be able to make the bed.  The only slight negative I would say is that my twin bed frame, box springs and mattress are not high enough to be able to fold the rail down completely flat against the side.  However, this isn\'t a big problem for me as you are still able to make up the bed easily.  I looked at a million and one different products and reviews before settling on this one.  The only additional comment I have is that I would definitely advise you to use the middle support rail whether you think you need it or not as it does give it added strength.  I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to others.",4
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"We are using this bedrail on a toddler bed with our twin sons.  They prefer to sleep together, but were too big for the crib.  At only 17 months old though they still needed the secure feeling of the crib bedside.  This has provided that safe and secure feeling for them and we\'re all sleeping well through the night - well most nights.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,Easy to install.  Work perfectly.  Fold down easily and look great. I bought two and fold both the rails down each morning to make my two year old daughter\'s bed.  You can not really tell they are there during the day and she hasn\'t fallen out of bed yet so in my opinion they are a great buy.  I bought 2 more sets for the grandparents\' houses.,5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"We started using this bed rail for each side of her bed (don\'t forget to order TWO- it only comes with one) since she left the crib. We believe this has saved her from falling countless times. She is old enough now to even tell us so. She doesn\'t want them off, even though it makes climing in and out of bed more of a hassle for her. Excellent product at an excellent price!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I spend a lot of time looking at and comparing products before I buy one--especially when it comes to baby/toddler safety products.  I looked at almost all the other bed rails before purchasing this one, and I\'m thrilled with it.First of all, it\'s very easy to assemble and install.  It took my husband about 5 to 10 minutes to put everything together.  He said it was easy.  The system used for making sure the bed rail doesn\'t push out from the side of the bed is a very simple strap system that installs quickly, even with our new heavy, super-plush twin beds.  Once installed, the bed rail doesn\'t budge an inch.  Also, the mechanism for folding the bedrail down (completely down!) when you want to make a bed is very easy...just slip the lock to the side, and then use a hand on each side of the bedrail to lift and fold--easy for adults, but not at all obvious for kids.  When you\'re done making the bed, just fold the rail back up and it clicks itself into place.Second, it looks great.  It\'s clean, crisp white--not some of the other glaring colors I\'ve seen in other bed rails.  It\'s very tall (perfect for the thick mattresses sold these days), and very long.  We keep it in the upright position once the bed is made, but it\'s simple enough to fold that you could keep it folded down and more out of sight when the bed is made.Third (and maybe this should have been second ;), it\'s safe.  Very safe.  We\'re using it with our two five-year olds, and the height of it is perfect for them.  I don\'t think they could roll or push themselves out of bed if they tried.  The frame is very sturdy.  It comes with a bar that goes through the middle of the mesh (covered and padded, of course).  It\'s removeable if you want (or if your bed is too thick), but we keep it in because it seems to add even more sturdiness and strength.I couldn\'t be happier with this product.  All of the others I looked at seemed to be either a mess to install, or they didn\'t fold down, or they looked awful.  This one was great on all three counts!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This railing was helpful for us, and I would buy another because the price is good, but in less than a year, it started bending outward--my daughter likes to sit up in bed and push against it-- so there is a big space between the bottom and the bed that I don\'t feel is very safe.",3
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"They don\'t seem to make beds with food boards any longer, so we got this for the foot of our bed. We have a cat bed there, and we didn\'t want kitty getting kicked off in the middle of the night.It\'s sturdy, easy to set up, and it stays in place really well. Granted, we aren\'t using it for kids, so I can\'t speak to safety, but it has held up well for us for a couple of years.",4
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This product may work great for a bed, but I didn\'t realize that it is not for a crib!  There was nothing wrong with the product, I just wish I knew it wasn\'t for use on a crib.",3
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I found this product to be an asset when it came time for my wife to nurse our baby in our bed.  This device folds up easily and although I would\'nt leave our baby unattended in the bed, it does the job when an adult is present such as for our use.",4
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Wonderful product.I did screw up the instructions as they are a little bit tricky - but don\'t let that discourage you. It still only took  5 min to put together, and I did it without assistance.You will need help putting it on the bed, as that is more complicated, but it\'s worth it for the security. This thing is NOT budging once it\'s in place, and I  love the security that provides me at night (and naptime)!It also folds completely down so you can do sheets, etc.I love it. Glad I went with this one. Would def. buy it again!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This bed rail is easy to set up, is tall enough to keep my toddler from rolling out of her new ""big girl bed,"" and makes changing the sheets a breeze because of how easily it folds down flat.  However, we are using it on a really high antique bed (our bed-skirt is 18 inches).  Love it!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Believe it or not, I ordered this item for my mini dachshund who kept falling out of bed.  The first time he rolled into the nylon, he ran from the rail and now no longer goes near it.  It has served our purpose in keeping the dog safe and from me getting up in the middle of the night to pick him up.  The folding down when not being used feature is great as well.  Nice product!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I bought two of these for my three year old, who we were transitioning from her crib to her ""big girl"" bed.  We got one for each side of the bed.  They were easy to assemble, looked nice (for bed rails), and were easy to fold down.  The only issue for us in assembly and general operation is that they are so tall in height that when we fold them down they do not lie flat against the side of the bed because the height of the rail is taller than the space from the floor to the hinge on the rail.When we assembled the products, there was an additional metal bar included (you can see it in the picture of the product at the height of the mattress top), which the instructions clearly state is not to be used unless you have an unusally tall mattress.  Otherwise, you are told to omit the bar.  We do not have an unusually tall mattress (the instructions gave a specific height and we missed it by several inches) so we omitted the bar.Last night was my daughter\'s first night sleeping in her bed and all went well. Tonight, however, I heard the frightening thunk of my daughter hitting the hardwood, followed immediately by her cries.  It appears she slipped between the upper bar and without the additional bar the mesh was inadequate to hold her on the bed.Thankfully, she seems fine.  I located the metal bars that were supposedly only for the tall mattresses and inserted them immediately because I do not think there would be a way for her to slip out with those installed.  Please beware when assembling this product to consider including these rails even if you do not have a tall mattress.",2
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Although the safety strap is a bit difficult to figure out how to tighten, the ""legs"" that go between the mattress and box spring do a fine job of holding it in place even when our 35 lb toddler is wedged up against it.  Love that it folds down almost all the way-another inch and it would.  This works perfectly and gives about a foot of room of open space at the head and about 18 in by the foot(where the step stool goes) on a full size ""big kid"" bed.",4
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"We tried a few other sleep guards and one was too short in the height causing my son to roll right outta bed. The second guard was too flimsy and when my son rolled against it when he was sleeping the darn thing pulled right out from under the mattress. The third one we tried the guard was supposed to be able to flip down so that you can get the bed changed easily, etc. Well it kept flipping down by it self.In desperate search for a quality sleep guard, we tried this one. I thought the price was a little high but figured we bought the cheaper ones and thats what we got cheap. So we spent the extra money and....THIS IS THE BEST SLEEP GUARD OUT THERE IN MY OPINION. MOMS AND DADS, DONT WASTE ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME, GET THIS ONE, TRUST ME FROM ONE PARENT TO ANOTHER, THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT!!!Thanks!! :)",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"We started using this with just a twin mattress on the floor. It has stood up to all sorts of pushing, pulling and rolling over. The rail has remained stable, and I can only imagine that it will be more so as we start to add box spring and the frame.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"We bought this bed rail when our older daughter transitioned to a twin bed. It fits the bed well, and because it doesn\'t have any parts that stick out, it fits easily between the wood side rail and the mattress. Our daughter is a very fitful sleeper, and we often find her lying perpendicular in the bed, pushing her legs up against the wall and her head against this bed rail. Even though she is so active while sleeping, she has never fallen out of bed with this rail on it. It is exceptionally sturdy, and even holds up to her climbing in and out of bed OVER the bed rail. For the price, you just can\'t beat this product. We are sold on it. And now that our younger daughter is transitioning out of HER bed, we are buying another one of these for her. Definitely a great purchase.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"It is perfect for our two-year old grandson and his momma while visiting us.  It is very well made, looks good,  and will continue to be in a lifesaver for many other grandchildren.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I ordered this bed rail, because it was the tallest rAil I could find to fit a 12"" thick cal king mattress. It is actually only 18"" tall, not 20"" (says it right on the package). I contacted Portlight and they immediately sent a prepaid return label and apologized for the mistake. I\'m dissapointed in the height, but otherwise it appears to be a great bed rail and Portlight has fantastic customer service. I would recommend this product if you have a mattress less then 12"" thick!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,This is a handy rail to keep little ones safe while they are transitioning to a big bed. Made well.,5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Got this rail for our 2 year old\'s full size bed.  It is sturdy and while we don\'t encourage her to push on it, we have confidence that it will not break, especially with the extra bar in place.  The locking mechanism is easy to use and lowering the rail is simple and smooth.  We don\'t see that it would be any better to have the rail slide under the mattress - seems we probably wouldn\'t do that very often. The only downside is that the mesh got a small hole in it rather quickly.  Not sure how it happened, but we would have liked a mesh that was a bit more tear resistant.  Have to see how that holds up, but this rail has served us well so far.",4
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I bought this bed rail to use on a twin bed I purchased for our granddaughter to use when she stays with us.  I didn\'t want to spend a lot of money on something that will only be used a couple of times a year, so this bed rail caught my eye.  It looks really nice, was easy to put together and gives really good coverage.  I highly recommend it!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I highly recommend this product.  I have used another bed rail productat my vacation home.  The rail was too short and my grandson fell out ofbed. This rail is extra long, very secure, easy to put together and easyto install.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Don\'t buy this if you have a pillow top mattress! It only ends up coming about an inch or so higher than the bed. It certainly doesn\'t look like it would keep your child from rolling off. And maybe its just our mattress but it doesn\'t even seem to be tight enough to the bed to be safe. For example, it may prevent your child from hitting the floor but they would probably end up between the rail and mattress. If you even gently push on the rail a large space opens up between it and the bed. I now have to return this product and wouldn\'t recommend it.",2
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I ordered this product thinking it would keep my 1 year old from falling out of bed while we were on vacation. He & I had to share a bed and I was worried about the open end by him. I put the bed rail together exactly as the instructions said and hooked it up to the bed, between the mattress and box spring, per instructions. We both went to sleep and I was awoken in the middle of the night to my baby falling out of the bed. The bed rail simply swung out of the way, doing nothing to stop him from landingon the floor. I do NOT recommend this product!",1
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Product should clearly state can\'t be used on a platform bed, or any bed that does not need a box spring.  Rail must clear box spring or lip by a significant amount in order to work. Had to return the item and had to pay a restocking fee. Really Annoying.",2
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,I purchased this for my sons big boy bed. We got a full since we had the space for it. This rail works very well and we are happy with it.,5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This was so easy to put together, stays very secure, and the safety strap was even long enough for a king size bed.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Very easy to install, and I love the quick drop-down feature for making the bed.  Don\'t know how the product could be any better.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This rail is working great for the twin bed that my not-quite 2 year old is sleeping in.  The bed has a wood frame with raised sides and no box springs.  I couldn\'t tell from the product or reviews if it would work with a frame bed, but I took a chance.  It works great!  Of course I can\'t fold it down (the bed frame is in the way) and it is a pain to change the bed, but it keeps her safe at night.  In fact she loves to sleep with her face shoved up against the mesh so I don\'t know how we will ever get it off of the bed!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"We ordered this prior to going on vacation with our 2 year old who is accustomed to sleeping in a toddler bed.  Not only was it easy to assemble, it kept her safe!!!  We now have it assembled at my parents\' house for whenever we sleep over.  EXCELLENT product for the price!!!!!!!  It\'s very easy to take down if you don\'t want to leave it up.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Easy to install, safe and secure. I purchased two in order to transition my granddaughter from a crib to a queen size bed.  Now we can both get a restful night sleep.",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This bedrailing is sturdy and doesn\'t move when my very active 23mo-old pushes and pulls on it, so I don\'t have any complaints.  But truthfully if I were to buy another one I\'d get a longer one (56"") so it doesn\'t leave so much space at the head/foot of the bed.  I now have to wedge pillows there. And I\'d get one that flips down for making the bed, or in case an adult needs to get in/out. That nicer model was on backorder so I got this one as my 2nd choice, and I\'m sort of sorry that I didn\'t wait.",4
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,This rails are good and have worked well for our daughters bed. We bought two last year for $20. I can\'t believe than they are selling for $50. They are a bit cheap looking so I wouldn\'t pay that much for them.,3
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"It took about 10 minutes to assemble and then 20 minutes to setup with adjusting it to the bed. I did this by myself, but probably could have been faster with two people. Our daughter sleeps in a full size bed and has woken up many times against it.The bed is slightly raised which worked out well as that allowed the rail to fold down flat and not jut out from the bed.So far we\'ve had it for ~3 months and it\'s shown no signs of wear. My daughter has leaned on it while standing in bed and it did not give a little.",5
Nico The Dog Small Pull Toy,Toy is WAY smaller than I thought it would be.  Going to have to give it away as a gift instead of having my son use it.,1
Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"The safety and the bouncer itself is a good product. The water feature makes the most obnoxious sound ever! Both of my children love to watch it, but the sound it makes is loud and drives me nuts! I ended up buying a different bouncer because my husband and I could not stand it anymore. Just an FYI for future buyers.",3
Baby Play Zone - Take-Along Hop\'n Pop,"PROS:I like this toy primarily because it fits into a corner in our bedroom.  It\'s not huge like most exersaucers but is still entertaining.Actually, I think this is the toy that really taught my son the concept of cause and effect.  He knows that if he bounces, something will happen.  In fact, he\'ll even sit in his high chair or on his ride-on and will jerk back and forth to see if something will happen. lol.CONS:He only likes to play in it for a few minutes every day.  He loved it when he first realized that it would play music and light up if he bounced.  However, it is lacking in the amount of activities/toys for him to play with, meaning that he doesn\'t want to play in it for too long.  But that may not be too big a problem for most because babies have a short attention span and tons of toys anyway.  However, since we\'re a little tight on space, I prefer toys that pack the most punch.  I just think that they could have put more activities into the toy while still keeping the toy small.Also, when folded, it\'s still about the same size as when it\'s not folded.Big cons: 1st) I hate the music.  It reminds me of cheerleader music which I think is inappropriate for babies.I would only recommend this for babies from 6-12 months because bigger babies would probably get bored very quickly.",3
Healthy Care Booster Seat,"We received this booster seat as a gift. We weren\'t sure how much we would use it, but we have used it a TON!  My husband says this is the first baby item we received for which he has no complaints!  Every other item seems to have one flaw (For example, ""why doesn\'t it fold better,"" ""didn\'t anyone test this?"" are common questions in our household).  This item is made perfectly. Easy to install, easy to take down, easy and light to carry, etc.  We have taken it everywhere when we needed a highchair for our daughter (to friends\' houses, to restaurants, etc.). Then, when my daughter got a bit older, we put away the highchair and used this as a booster at the table until she was 2 1/2 years old. For the price, you just cannot get better! However, I would recommend buying it elsewhere- it is much cheaper at Target and Babies R Us. Amazon has marked up the price.",5
Healthy Care Booster Seat,"These are so nice if you live in an apartment, with twins, and little room to spare. We originally had the quadruped high chairs that didn\'t break down or hide at all, and a six seater table. So, we had to find a place to stash two chairs for the table. My wife found these and they\'ve been a blessing ever since. We eventually got rid of the quad chairs and moved our other two dining room chairs back to their table.Pros:* Very space friendly. (The back folds down, and the lids cover up the top where they latch. Slides, while still attached to the chair, under our table.)* The trays are dishwasher safe. (If you have kids, you understand!)* Portable. (They take up a little room in the trunk, but it keeps the in-laws from having to have their own seats for our twins)* Usable for many ages. (From the beginning of solid foods up to when your kids cans sit in an adult chair)* Not too many crevices for food to hide in. (relatively easy to clean up with a Clorox Wipe)* Safe (As long as you have a sturdy chair mind you)Cons:* The whole seat isn\'t dishwasher safe. (Yes, I am being a little lazy there)* Kind of a small base. (I have to put kitchen towels under the seat while it\'s installed to keep the mess off my cloth covered chairs)When it comes right down to it these seats are spectacular, and well worth the money! The cons are easily overcome to make these the perfect chairs for most any beginning family.",5
Biella Crib - White,"I fell in love with this crib online because of its beautiful design and antique white finish.  Thinking it would match perfectly with the antique white furniture already in my daughter\'s room, I went to a local Babies R Us to purchase the crib -- but was incredibly surprised to see that the crib was much more of a buttery soft yellow than a true antique white.  I had read a previous review describing a yellowish color, but was amazed to see it in person and see that the manufacturer would use the description ""antique white.""  If you are buying the changing table along with the crib, the biella set is absolutely gorgeous and the buttery yellow finish is magnificent -- but be careful if you are ordering online without seeing it in person because the online photo of the crib does not show its true finish.",5
Biella Crib - White,I saw this crib on the Babies r us web site and fell in love with it.  I went to the store to order it and they had one on the floor.  I changed my mind when I saw it.  On the Web site it looks off white (which I wanted) but in the store it is a honey yellow and was too over powering with the bedding I bought. I was very disappointed.  I really wanted this crib.,3
Biella Crib - White,I loved the look of this crib and changing table/dresser so we bought it! And it IS beautiful! We have had it in our babies room for 6 months and I am sooo dissapointed! The paint ( cream color that you see) on the changing table has started to flake off and it seems with every day more of the paint is missing. Since the crib doesn\'t get as much wear and tear ( opening drawers etc.) I would recommend the crib. But if you are thinking of buying any coordinating pieces of this furniture... don\'t expect it to last too long.,2
Biella Crib - White,"My husband and I love the crib, it is beautiful. We also have the matching Armoire and Changing Table, our daughter\'s room is breathtaking...",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Two problems with this product.  As another review noted, the bassinet sags a little in the middle.  That\'s because it\'s designed to fold up for easy storage/travel.  The other problem is that the changing table portion (which is accessed by lifting the bassinet off the base) is very hard to clean.  The instructions say to ""surface clean with soapy water"".  That works fine if the baby only soils the plastic covered bottom of the changing surface.  However, if she should launch her poop or pee onto the cloth portion, clean up is extremely difficult.  The cloth of the bassinet is removeable for machine washing; the cloth of the changing table should have been designed to be removeable as well.",3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Let\'s just say that I wish that I had bought this for my first daughter instead of using the crappy bassinet that came with our pack n play.  I would have probably slept a whole let easier and so would she.  This bassinet is comfy, the vibration is a life saver and it fit perfectly beside my bed.  I would tell all new mommies that they\'ve got to get one of these!",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Initally when the baby came home from the hospital, I used this product as a bassinet.  However, after a few sleepless weeks, I placed the portable sleeper in the bed in between me and my husband.  Since then, the baby has been sleeping like a champ!!  It\'s so easy to check on him in the middle of the night.  I don\'t know what I\'d do without this product!",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",My 1 month old daughter pushes her face up against basinet walls and it makes it hard for her to breathe. She has been doing this since she was like a week old. She always manages to move to side of bassinet which worries me even when placed in middle. Walls in bassinet are not very breathable.,3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I purchased this bassinet because I borrowed a similar model for my first child and all the features were spectacular.  When I purchased the new model for baby #2, I was disappointed to find that it has been redesigned not to rock, contradicting the product description on Amazon, the description provided by the manufacturer, the outdated photos on the box, and the product highlights on the box, all of which clearly indicate that the product rocks. When I called the manufacturer, thinking perhaps they had included the wrong base in my package, they informed me that they changed the design for safety reasons without changing the packaging or the description, and my only choice was to return the product and purchase another.  My first child slept like a rock with the help of the vibrations, the nature sounds, the music, and the hanging toys, and I loved the nightlight, the mobility, and the design, so I would still recommend this product to parents who are not concerned with rocking their child to sleep.  I, however, am returning it for something that actually does what it says.",2
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",I am currently pregnant with our 2 child. I have less then a month to go until my due date and I found this to be easy to put together by myself with only a toddler to help me. I can not comment on how the baby sleeps in it yet but I found it to be built more stable then some reviews made it seem. So far I\'m happy with the product. I don\'t think we will be able to use it long but we only want it until the baby is on a schedule. Shipping was very fast.,4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",The last reviewer really nailed it. I love this sleep system! The picture really doesn\'t do it justice because its actually a really pretty light cream color. My fiance had it put together in less than 30 minutes and everything works just fine and is VERY sturdy. I was kind of disappointed that batteries did not come with it. It will be perfect for my son who is due in February.,5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",I loved this bassinet. I used it for my baby girl and then sold it to another family to enjoy; still in perfect condition months later.,5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I returned this item because it was not the same color as the bassinet in the picture. It wasn\'t as pretty. It did not have all the bows, or pockets that were featured. I was dissapointed and ordered the bassinet that I saw in the picture somewhere else!The return process was very easy, although I am unsure that I will order anything other than books from Amazon.",1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","It is a great bassinet, but we have to take it apart just to move it to the next room.  The wheels are too wide apart, but if you have wider doorways go for it!",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I am very happy with our purchase. We have a few weeks before we get someone in there, but we like it so far! It is larger than I was expecting, which is great! It is a bit more wobbly that I expected, which is not so great. The fabric cannot come off of the bassinet to be washed, so I\'m a little bit unhappy with that. However, it\'s SO cute and I just can\'t wait to use it!",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",the item I bought was so wonderful it was just what i was looking for thanks for the great speedy service,5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","The sleep system looks pretty and matches any decor.  I love that it is light and moves easily around the house.  I also like the mesh material that allows airflow and helping prevent SIDS.  It is also at a nice, comfortable height and doesn\'t take up a lot of space.  I very much like the large storage area underneath.Unfortunately, there are many aspects that are unnecessary.  The change table is inconvenient to get to...if you have to move the bassinet off - where are you going to put it?  Also, lowering the height makes the storage area and its ties look slouchy.  So I never adjusted the height and thus could not use it as a cosleeper.  My newborn also wasn\'t responsive to vibrations, the sounds, rocking, or the toys hanging from the canopy.  She never even looked at the toys.My biggest complaint is the 1/4 inch pad they call a mattress.  When I put my hand on it, I could feel the straps underneath (they came out of the middle), which we didnt use, and the three sections of the bassinet base (I guess which are supposed to incline).  I got a 2-inch bassinet mattress, which helped to soften the bumps and uneaven bottom of the bassinet.To be honest, I would have preferred to have the baby sleeping next to me, especially during those exhausting frequent night feedings.  But out of concern for her safety, using this bassinet wasn\'t too bad.",3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","The idea of this bassinet is great: just unhook the basket from the base and take your baby with you. Add the features of soothing sounds, nightlight, play seat, and changing table and it all just sounds too good to be true. Well, it is too good to be true.Let me be clear, the bassinet is useful and I will continue using it. However, it does NOT work as expected. I would have been better off buying a simpler, cheaper bassinet.Here are the problems:- It won\'t go low enough to line up with my bed, so I can\'t just look over in the middle of the night, I have to sit up to check up on baby.- The base is too wide to fit through doorways. When baby was sleeping, sometimes I tried to roll the whole bassinet our of the bedroom and into the office so I could get some work done. But no, the base would get stuck in the doorway.- The rocker function, for me, was pointless. It was too cumbersome to switch from wheels or stable feet to rocker, so I never used the rocker.- It\'s too heavy and awkward to carry around. Much easier to simply take baby out and carry baby around in my arms.- The vibrator stopped working. The sounds still work, but the vibrator stopped working after just a few weeks of use.- The straps to attach the basket to the top can get confused with the straps for the changing table. They should have color coded the straps or used a different method of attachment.- The fabric is difficult to remove if/when it gets dirty.- The mattress has holes for the play seat straps. It makes the mattress lumpy and weird.- The play seat function should have varied reclined positions. Or perhaps it just shouldn\'t have a play seat function.",3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Bassinet was easy to put together after reading the other reviews, quality of bassinet is better than expected. However, after putting it together, I failed to promptly check the electronics on the bassinet. Two weeks before our baby\'s arrival as I was hand washing (yes, hand washing as none of the material comes off to put in the washer machine) I finally put in the batteries to the night light, music etc and to my surprise none of the electronics work. Will not be returning due to not enough time before our little one arrives. Word to the wise check the electronics as soon as possible. Not too happy that I will not be able to take advantage of these features.",3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I LOVE this bassinet. It has great music and vibration settings, a night light, and it is super cute. You can store little toys (or whatever) underneath. However, my daughter is not a big fan. She will sleep in it, but some nights she is not having it. I would still recommend though because it is a great bassinet and should get a great review even though it is not my daughter\'s favorite. The only reason i gave four stars is because it is a little difficult to move, but not bad at all. Oh, and it only took about 30-60 minutes to set up.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",My son only slept in this when we took him into the living room in the carrier. He would cry and cry even when we used the vibrating or music feature. Be careful b/c you will trip on the legs! Just put your baby in the crib don\'t waste extra money on a bassinet!,2
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I love this, I bought this for my daughter and her new little one and it has turned out to be so handy. It\'s perfect.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Although ""The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System"" isn\'t washable, overall, I didn\'t have a problem with the design, but unfortunately, the quality of the fabric and the poor craftsmanship warranted my returning it. Regarding the craftsmanship, in my opinion, the quality of the sewing and stitching is way below grade, and the absense of bar tacks is a clear sign of cost cutting. If you\'re looking for a heirloom piece, The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System isn\'t for you, for sure.",2
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",I absolutely LOVE this product.  I actually recieved it from a friend. As the other person said about picture #5.. ummm hello... it is NOT the same product.  You can tell.  The seller definately has the WRONG picture on it!  Otherwise I love it since it has a changing table and it is also a Moses basket and I can take it anywhere.  I also love how it will fold up for travel and so forth.  I love the night light and music!  I cant wait to use it for my baby... he is due in 7 weeks!!,5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","My mother bought this bassinet for me and my new baby girl, so I had not read any of the reviews myself. I can say that after reading some of the negative reviews, I am surprised because I have no real issues with this product.Many people comment that the mattress sags in the middle. Mine does not, so I have to wonder if this is a defect. Yes, it did come folded, but once unfolded it seems just fine and my baby seems to sleep comfortably enough in it. I do agree with a comment I saw on the non-removable harness; I am not using it so my baby does lie on top of it which seems like it would be uncomfortable. Fortunately she does not seem to mind. I\'m sure the harness is a good idea for older children with more mobility, however I plan to switch to a crib at that point.I personally really like this product. I find detaching the top and adjusting the handle to be a breeze (I know others have said they do not) and it\'s great to be able to have baby in whatever room I am in. I noticed at least one reviewer has said that there is no way to attach the top to the base, but there are actually straps on either side that latch together and it seems perfectly snug when properly connected.I particularly like the light, sounds, and vibration feature. The light is just handy. The vibration helps baby fall deeply asleep, as does the heartbeat sound. They all shut off automatically, which is great, although I wish they lasted a bit longer before turning off. Sometimes she is not completely asleep when the sound and vibration stops, and I have to turn them on again before she rouses or we have to start falling asleep all over again!I also found the product fairly easy to assemble. The instructions seemed pretty clear to me and it took little time to put together. However I am one of those people who don\'t mind assembling products even with crappy instructions, so I may not be the best judge of this.One last comment I can make is that the wheels on the bottom are a problem for me if I try to move the whole structure. It won\'t fit through my doorways unless the wheels are in which defeats the purpose of the wheels. However I have been just detaching the top and leaving the rest where it is anyway, so this isn\'t as much of a problem for me. I know someone else has said that it fits their doorways just fine, and doors do tend to vary a bit in width, so it could just be the doors in my house.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","In the pictures the bassinet doesn\'t show stickers on the handle. But it has 2 huge stickers that cover the whole handle. After trying to remove the stickers, the handle is cover of glue and peaces of paper. The quality is so poor that I tried to clean it with special products to remove stickers, etc. It looks dirty, there is no way to remove the glue of the sticker.",1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I received this beautiful bassinet as a gift for me and our first baby girl. I\'m including some pictures, and I want to edit this review after our daughter arrives so we know how it actually works, but in the mean time:Pros:  It\'s beautiful.  The bassinet/carrier portion lifts off easily, and latches into place when you want it stationary. The storage basket underneath holds a ton of stuff, and the height for the whole thing is adjustable.  It fits next to our bed without any difficulty (there is a little rubbery pad that slides under our mattress to keep it close to the side}.  We like most of the sounds that come with it; the heart, the brook, the rain.  It does have a light that works and turns off by itself if you fall asleep after turning it on.  The rocking feature seems like it would work really well.  The mobile-style animals are cute, soft, and removable.  The fabric is a little stiff, but I can tell it will soften with use.  It is a pale yellow-ivory with creamier, paler ivory swirls.  The bassinet is quite long as well.  I can see my daughter using the bassinet portion for her dolls as she gets older.Cons:  My husband and I had a heck of a time figuring out how to put it together (we didn\'t find the instructions until we searched online and found someone else had the same problem- the instructions were hidden in the folded up bassinet itself).  We have had difficulty with the wheels (we have carpet and the wheels don\'t seem to work that great on it), but the wheels retract relatively easily so you can lift it to move it if necessary.  I don\'t know how practical the changer is beneath the bassinet; the base of the changer is plastic, but it quickly turns to cloth as it curves up the sides, and it only removable with great difficult as it is physically attached to the frame of the bassinet base.  The bassinet portion has an inset of mesh, but the remainder of the sides are cloth; again, I don\'t know how much of a problem this will be, as this is our first and I\'m already a light sleeper.  The entire system is only rated up to 17 pounds, so I don\'t know how long we\'ll be able to use it.  The handle to carry the bassinet has deceptively hidden buttons to unlock it and recline it, which has frustrated me several times so far.  The Twinkle Twinkle song is very digitized, and harsh to the ears.Again, we haven\'t ""used"" it yet as our daughter isn\'t here, but I wanted to get some pictures out there and at least give an additional opinion for those that are looking at this product.",3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I was a bit skeptical because of some of the reviews, but this is wonderful!  Being able to take my daughter anywhere and lay her down to sleep allows me to stay close while still getting things done.  She loves the vibrations and water sounds too.  And being able to use it as a changing table is an added benefit.  One caution:  there is batting to make the sides soft, but it is too high up, so I worried about suffocation if my daughter\'s face got too close. I just made a little cut on each side and pulled all the batting out--problem solved.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I do like this bassinet. I think it\'s beautiful. I think it\'s very functional. I like that I can fold it up and take it with me as a travel piece and it\'s so much easier than messing with a pack and play. This bassinet though is a good foot higher than our standard bed. So I still have to sit up to get baby out. No big deal to me though, really. I also can\'t imagine taking bassinet out just to use the changing station, but it\'s there if you need it I guess. It is also fairly heavy. I think it\'s heavier than our infant carseats, or close to it. Add a baby in there and there\'s is no way I am carrying baby from room to room in that thing. Other than that though, it is a sturdy, functional bassinet.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I bought this bassinet so that my son could sleep in my room for the first couple of months of his life, before he moves into his room and his crib.  We shopped around and read reviews of a bunch of different bassinets, and we decided on this one.  I was excited about its portability and the built-in changing table, and while I read that the bassinet portion did not attach to the rest of it, I also read that the changing-table straps could be used to secure it, and so I wasn\'t concerned.  However, when it arrived, I found that the bassinet really does just rest in the changer, and the straps MUST be sort of wound around to attach it for the sake of safety.  This makes the carrying portion of the bassinet and the changing table both extremely inconvenient to use, as I have to unfasten and unwind the straps each time I want to move it.  It\'s just not worth the effort, and so I don\'t use either feature.  I do not know why the company has not changed this.  It would not be terribly difficult to create a way of securing the bassinet to the base that would be safe and easily detached for use.  This is why I deducted a star.Other than that, though, we have no complaints.  The bassinet is right next to the bed so that I do not have to get up to feed my son in the middle of the night.  I love that the height was adjustable because it allowed me to create a co-sleeping type experience without having the baby in the bed.  However, I would say that my bed is quite tall and the bassinet had to be set on the lowest setting, so I can see how it would be too tall for some people\'s beds.  I have not had the problems that other people have expressed in their reviews: my bassinet is level, and the bassinet bottom feels very flat and sturdy to me, with no dipping or caving.  Although the mattress is quite firm, my son has no trouble sleeping on it, and he seems comfortable.  He doesn\'t really look at the hanging decorations, but I like that I can put the hood of the bassinet up or down, which helps keep the light from his eyes.  My son also doesn\'t appear to like the vibration or the sounds, but they work well.Additional sheets can be purchased from The Learning Curve for a very reasonable $5 per sheet plus $2 shipping per order.  Overall, the bassinet has more frills than we needed, and the company should change some things, but we\'re still very pleased with our purchase, and would recommend it to anyone.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",Works great as a bassinet but did not find it practical to use the changing table or storage area. Like the battery operated features. Especially the light and music/sounds. Looks pretty.,3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I purchased this bassinet when I was pregnant; and being that I had not used a bassinet with my older children, I was a little hesitant on how well I would like it.I LOVED it!  And I\'m not the only one.  Now that my daughter is 4 months old, she has outgrown it (has less than 1 inch when stretched completely out) and we purchased her aDaVinci Emily Mini Crib - Oak.  She REFUSES to sleep in it and wants only to sleep in her bassinet.Her refusal alone tells me the bassinet must be very comfortable; not to mention soothing because of the small space.This bassinet also features a built in changer and soothing sounds (heartbeat, waterfall, chirping, music); neither of which we ever used.  It also has a built in light which came in very handy for those middle of the night waking times.Having little pace left, we also liked the storage basket underneath.  It was great for holding blankets and other small things.I would highly recommend this bassinet to those considering purchasing one.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","This bassinet is perfect for what it was designed for.  We don\'t have much space in our bedroom, and this puppy fits nicely next to the bed.  My wife can reach over at night, grab the baby, feed her, and put her back in without getting out of bed.  It is cozy and cute, and easy to pack for overnight stays elsewhere.  The led light is handy too, as it is just bright enough to see what you\'re doing without being too annoying.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","This bassinet was one of my first purchases, it\'s a little on the small side, but very easy to put together, very sturdy and you can move it from room to room (wheels on the bottom) It\'s very cute, you can also detach it from the stand and carry the baby around. I like the fact that the height of this bassinet is adjustable- not sure why the other reviews said it\'s too high. Also the bottom basket for storage is handy as well.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I had got this Bassinet for my baby shower five years ago. It was my favorite gift. And now my husband and I having another child,, I cant wait to go buy this bassinet again. I am so happy that they are still making it. I would never buy any other one, it was very easy to put together, easy to travel with and get around the house.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",We loved the  bassinet from an aesthetic perspective unfortunately our daughter hated it.  I think it\'s too deep and she can\'t see through the sides or over the brim so panics every time we place her in it.  We\'re sad to put this in the basement but hope a baby in our future will enjoy it more.,3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","First of all it looks absolutely beautiful! I was searching for a bassinet for a few months before I had my son and this one was my final choice and I am very happy about it.  I\'ve seen many other bassinets and I simply didn\'t even feel comfortable putting my baby into those. We had our son in this bassinet all the way up until her gained 17 pounds. It was nice and convenient to have him right next to my bed and if he was sleeping I could just pick up the top part and move him with me. As a new mother I was getting up see if he is breathing every time I thought he was too quiet. So believe me, that nightlight was used ALL THE TIME. The running water and birds sounds were very soothing for me and the baby. I also loved the feature that you could turn the wheels and rock the bassinet. If you live in a little apartment every inch of space is valuable and the storage basket was very helpful too. The only thing I didn\'t use was the changing table. So, don\'t think that this is only for a little time and it costs too much money - it\'s worth every penny and you\'ll probably use it for about 4 months. Enjoy it the way we did :)",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","This bassinet is very cute, it has everything you need. The only thing I don\'t care for is the height, I find it a little too tall. It is a very good quality.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","It is ok, a bit flimpsy. You have to be careful when rolling it around to move to a different spot, but I guess for the price it is acceptable.",3
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I registered for this item and was a little sceptical because the reviews I had seen were 50/50. I ended up taking the chance and I am so glad I did!My daughter is a week old and I have yet to actually use the changing table... I am to impatient to raise the bassinett and take off the top. But this item is still worth buying.The light actually lights up our whole room with a very soft pleasent light. And I love the fact that it is almost perfectly level to our bed when lowered, it makes it so easy to lean over and check on baby in the middle of the night. And I love the fact that it rocks!The only things I didnt like about the bassinett are:*It is a pain to lower and raise... wich is why I havent used the changing table yet.*It is way to easy to activate any of the features on the handle such as the music and the light... I accidentally hit the buttons in the middle of the night all the time. Our dog leaned over the edge to check out the baby and turned on the music.*The base is the bassinett is wide... we dont have a lot of trouble getting it through the doorway, but we have little room on that side of the bed and I have hit my toes on the wheels many time. They stick out a little to far.I absolutely love this item! I was given another bassinett, but registered for this one anyway. If I hadnt recieved it I would have gone and boughten it myself, its well worth it. And while I am all about pink pink pink for my daughter I really do lie the neutral colors... and that says alot!",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","My daughter comfortably slept in this for 12 weeks before we had to move her to something larger because she liked to sleep sideways.  At the time, we were living in a small space waiting for our house to be built and it was a great spacesaver.  We used the changing table portion for her sponge baths and it worked great.  The bottom storage was her laundry basket.  We never carried around the bassinet portion, it\'s a bit too bulky.  Overall, I would recommend this, especially to those in small spaces.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Excellent, my newborn loved it. She is growing out of it and I\'m so sad to move her to a crib. She just loved this bassinet. The music put her to sleep. She liked the toys hanging from the top. The night light was useful. And the bassinet looked so pretty in her bedroom. Great product.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream",The only complaints is that the sounds are pretty crummy - hardly worth using. But it\'s a nice bassinet for the price.,4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Havent used for baby yet, will update with more useful review.There were NO instructions that came with the bassinet, took me way longer to put together than it should have. I also recommend getting a different mattress, the one that comes with the bassinet is JUNK. I reused my old bassinet mattress, which is way better than the flimsy piece this came with.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Great bassinet for the price.  We never used it as a changing table or carry me... however, our 4 month old still loves this little bed, especially the rocker.pros - compact, attractive, nice to have the music & sounds and convenient basket to store baby stuff. Also, you can attach baby\'s favorite toys instead of the ones this comes with.con - how in the world do you clean all this fabric?? it\'s sewn on!!we just spot clean, but really this is a huge oversight!",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I really like this bassinet! My favorite part is the vibrating option; I don\'t know what it is but babies love vibration. I had a cradle with my first son and didn\'t even come close to this. The only negative thing I can think of is the bassinet unit it self just sets into dock and I wish it clicked or something just for a little added security, but besides that no complaints from me and I\'m a very picky mommy!!!I would defiantly recommend to anyone who wants to get the most for their money",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","First of all this bassinette is a pain to get through standard doorways and ours is a relatively new house. You have to angle it going through a doorway. Also its rocking legs get in the way. It\'s hard not to stumble on them. The changing table is a pain to use. You have to remove the bed to get to it. The bed is not secured by anything. Don\'t raise the frame to the highest setting or it will tip over if the wheels are not locked in place. The ""mattress"" is very thin and needs extra padding if you want your baby to be comfy in it. We had to add lots of extra padding in ours in order not to feel the hard split board in the bottom. You can\'t find extra mattress covers that will work unless you get rid of that terrible belt that is part of the pad. We got rid of that in ours. The music/vibrator/light did not work at first so we kept fiddling with the battery pack and eventually got it working but that took longer than the actual assemble of the bassinette. Also the hood would not stay propped up on its own either.We saw many at Babies-r-Us, where we bought it, that the boxes looked like they were previously opened. We bought one that had no signs of tampering. Thankfully all the parts were there but we should have realised why there so many previously opened boxes.It may look nice but ""don\'t judge something by how it looks"".Avoid buying this thing. We\'ve seen better bassinettes out there after seeing this thing\'s faults. Too bad its too late to return this awful bassinette.",1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I like this bassinet. I find that the ruffles, though pretty, make it hard to find what you\'re looking for in the storage basket underneath. I also wish there were more music options (there are several sounds, but only one song, ""Fur Elise"".) I don\'t use the changing table myself, but my husband does, and given his propensity for messy accidents during diaper changes, I\'m glad he likes it! I usually just change the baby on the bed, since I\'m too lazy to move the bassinet in order to use the table.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I ordered this bassinet under Amazon\'s free shipping. 3 days later it arrived on my doorstep:) Assembly took me a little over an hour, but considering my ample pregnant belly and inability to move well that really isn\'t bad. I did have to reference the instructions a few times to answer some questions, but other than that putting it together was a snap. The only part that I had trouble with was finding the buttons to put the handle to the bassinet down. I searched for quite a while because I\'d expected them to be somewhere on the handle and the instructions were not clear. As it turns out they are located on the edge of the bassinet just inside the handle on both sides. They are covered by fabric that is pinned down so you can\'t see them, but if you run your hand along the top edge you will be able to feel them.While I have not used this product yet, I am very happy with it so far.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","My baby is 2 weeks old. For us it\'s just a bassinet, but a great one at that. We don\'t like taking it apart to use the changer.It looks great and my baby sleeps like... well, like a baby.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Overall, this bassinet was a great purchase.  It does everything it is intended for.  Unfortunately our son had a severe case of acid reflux and he really would not sleep much in the bassinet, even with his head raised.  We had to switch to co-sleeping so we could assist him quickly when he gagged or spit up.  At night we would use this bassinet as the changing table, although it was a tad short as a changing table, but it worked.  During the day he could nap in his bassinet.  We loved the night light, vibration, and water sounds as the latter two soothed our son and the night light helped whenever we heard choking or needed to check on him.  It was bright enough to see, but not so bright it blinded you.  All three are on timers, so they turn off after a bit.One aesthetic problem we had was the handle of the bassinet had manufacturer\'s stickers on it, showing all the functions, which was nearly impossible to get off.  I scrubbed on it for hours and there is still a dirty looking residue outline on the handle from the impossible adhesive.  I don\'t know if this was just our unit or not, but it is annoying to have something new, not be perfect in appearance.Also in the bassinet, the head can be raised which is a wonderful feature.  The only problem is that there needs to be one more setting.  Down, the bed was too flat and up was too upright.  It would be much better if there was one more setting in the middle of these two.  Instead, we ended up using my Boppy pregnancy wedge to raise his head at just the right height.This is our first child and if I knew what I knew now I probably would have gotten a co-sleeper bed instead of the bassinet.  I was adamant against co-sleeping until our little one arrived and had so many digestive issues that the bassinet wasn\'t an option for us.  However, for those not in need of co-sleeping, this bassinet does work great and I would recommend it.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","So far, my one month old likes this, but we only use the portable sleeper, and bassinet portion of it.  I never used the co-sleeper, or the changing table, which if you use it as a bassinet, you can\'t also use it as a changing table unless you feel like lifting the bassinet up each and every time. Play seat??It\'s great for the price though, and easy to put together, plus the decor is neutral, which is always a plus.**You may want to purchase a waterproof pad and get receiving blacnkets and put that over the cushion of the bassinet, as any wetness immediately goes through the whole thing.",4
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Bought it, assembled it, decided it was a piece of crap, disassembled it, put in for a return.  The mattress pad is SIDS scary, but if that\'s not enough, it\'s just such a cheap piece of junk.  Don\'t know what I\'m going to replace it with yet, but I\'m not putting my kid in that thing.",1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","This bassinet is useful for a newborn, as we could take our baby from room to room, but I wish the mattress was sturdier. You can see the dent in our baby\'s head makes daily. What\'s worse is that when the bassinet basket is placed on the stand, as in the pictures, the mattress and frame dip in the middle. It\'s built w/o a sturdy bottom so that it can be converted into a seat for older babies and is a major construction flaw, in my opinion. It helps to place the bassinet basket on a flat surface like the couch or floor, but then we can\'t wheel it it around.",2
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I purchased this with my first child in 2005 and LOVE it.  It\'s super convenient, has all the bells and whistles, is light-weight, and durable.  I\'ve passed it to two friends for their babies and used it for my son born in 2007 and my 2nd daughter born in 2009.  This bassinet is still in great condition with absolutely NO problems and it still is top of the line 4 years after buying it.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","My wife and I are using this bassinet for our newborn daughter until her crib arrives, and so far, we have found that it has alot of nice features.Our daughter sleeps comfortably in the bassinet, although we added a bassinet pad for extra comfort.  She likes the variety of musical sounds, but the vibrating motor scares her, and we fell that it might be a little strong, even on the lowest setting.We like the fact that the bassinet is height adjustable, and the highest setting is perfect for seeing into the bassinet from our bed.The under-bassinet storage is convenient for the overnight supply of diapers, creams, wipes, etc.The major inconveniences that we have found involve the base and wheels on the unit.  The wheels are small, and are inadequate when trying to wheel the bassinet in and out of our carpeted bedroom.  It feels as if you are dragging the unit across the carpet, and I constantly find myself checking the wheel locks, thinking that they might be in the locked position, which they never are.Also the base is so wide that it does not fit through my standard side bedroom doorway.  I need to tilt the unit sideways and upright in order to get it into the bedroom - which then tosses all of the supplies in the under-bassinet basket into a big messy pile.",4
"3-Pack Sleeveless Bodysuits in Blue, Small","These are worth the money.  They came quickly and were actually cuter than I expected.  They are constructed well, didn\'t shrink, and are sized fairly true.  Some other brands\' sizing is way off, but these are good.",5
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"I received the Britax Companion carseat as a gift and I was searching for a Britax carseat that I can purchase for my child when he/she reaches up to 22lbs.-80lbs.  I found out that amazon.com had given us the wrong information ... The Wizard is rated for children rear facing from 5 to 33 pounds and forward facing at least one year old and 20 to 65 pounds, up to 49 inches. &lt;&lt;&lt; only up to 65 lbs. NOT 80 lbs. per BritaxUSA.com.  In addition, I came across this at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000BUSS6/102-0312258-2784138?v=glancePLEASE READ...Dear Britax Owner: This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Britax Child Safety, Inc. has decided that Marathon, Wizard, and Husky restraints, as well as the Traveller Plus, manufactured by Britax for Snug Seat, fail to conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213, Child Restraint Systems. According to our records, your child restraint system may be affected. What\'s Wrong. Extensive testing has determined that under certain circumstances, the adjuster strap may slip within the metal adjuster that controls the tightness of the harness and may allow the harness to loosen. While occurrence of this slippage is extremely rare, if it were to occur, in the event of a crash, your child may move further forward than allowed under Safety Standard 213. With this condition, there is the increased risk of injury.",1
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"We have been using the Wizard carseat with our son for 9 months, since he turned a year. I\'m so happy we made that choice - not only because we bought the safest carseat on the market, but because its  so easy to adjust the height, it\'s extremely durable and its easy to keep clean.",5
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"We bought the Eddie Bauer.  Had problems and went back and bought this one.  I should have bought this one the first time.  We got this over the weekend and so far everytime I have put my 6 mo old in it he has fallen asleep with ""no head falling foward"".  He seems very comfy.  He isn\'t quite used to the 5 pt harness yet as his Graco only had 3 but if that is the only complaint then it was well worth the money.In this area I would recommend to spend the extra money and get this.  The base is small; it fits perfectly in our VW passat with plenty of room for the middle and other side of the backseat.  It reclines the furthest of all for the rear-facing position.  It has velcro on the sides to grab the harness and keep it out of the way as you put your baby into and out of the seat.  The strap to tighten the harness is much easier to use.  Installation for the LATCH took less than 10 minutes.  The Eddie Bauer took 45 minutes, had to ensure everything wasn\'t twisted and the latches for the LATCH were difficult between the seats and the base of the carseat.Difinitely the best buy.....",5
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"When I bought this seat I heard nothing but great things about it, I even had an EMT recommend it to me, it was great for my son as he was big for his age and I figured I needed it when he was 6 months old, I only wanted to buy one car seat and this would be it as it said up to 80 lbs.  Will it is up to 65lbs not 80lbs, not to big of a deal until a few months ago.  My son now 27 months old likes to throw things behind him and then cry for me to get it while I am driving.  Well one day he threw a toy behind him and didn\'t cry about it, I looked back and he had it in his hand.  He had push the top buckle down and got his arms out of the seat and could turn almost completely around.  This made me very nervous and when I called Britax they said well sorry ma\'ma, but we can\'t help it if your child can get himself out of the carseat.  Are you kidding me shouldn\'t they be testing these things?  Carseats should keep our children safe even from themselves.  Then just this evening we were on our way home and again he took his arms out of the seat, I pulled over and put him back in.  A few mintues later he did it again and again I pulled over and put him back in.  And a third time he takes his arms out and before I could pull over he had unbuckled both the top and the bottom belt and he was standing in the back of the car.  What a horrifing feeling driving in a car while my 27 month old is completely out of his carseat.  Thank goodness nothing happened to him, but every second counts.  A carseat should be safe in an accident as well as safe from the child who is sitting in it.  Please be careful when considering any carseat purchase.  It is your childs life we are talking about.",2
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"We bought this seat from the Babies ""R"" Us store local to us.Here\'s my thoughts.  The head restraint are a great concept, but the positioning is wrong relative to the shoulder harness.  The headrest and the shoulder harness straps entry point into the seat back are interconnected in one moveable piece.  That may be somewhat confusing if you have not seen this seat in person, but the portion of the seat back that the headrest is attached to is also the same peice that the shoulder straps enter into the seat through.  This peice is movable,up and down, in order to properly adjust the shoulder harness.  The harness should go over the shoulders and straight into the seat back, not over the shoulders and down at any appreciable angle.  The reason for this is that the force in a collision (from the front) will compress the spine of the child as they are forced forward if the harness is entering the seat too far below the shoulders in the back.  The problem is that when the shoulder harness is properly adjusted the headrest is too high up relative to the childs head.  When I have the harness properly adjusted to our daughter, the bottom edge of the headrest is at about the mid to top of her ear and most of the headrest is extending above her head.  This is likely why I have seen posts about this seat complaining about the childs head getting stuck under the headrest when they fell asleep.  This problem is unfortunately built into the seat and not user fixable.The other shortcoming of the seat is the position of the shoulder harness tightening strap.  It exits the seat between the childs legs and is reachable by the child when strapped in unless the shoulder straps are tightened to the point that the child has no mobility whatsoever.  So while in motion (driving along) you find that the child has reached down, grabbed the strap and loosened their shoulder harness.  Very dangerous!  I fixed this problem by doing some hand sewing to the little flap that is velcro\'ed over the strap.  By stitching the cover down at each corner, our daughter can no longer raise the strap at a sharp enough angle to release the latch, but we can still get our finger under the cover from the front in order to release the strap.The seat is also too sparsly padded.All things considered, I would still rather have my child in a seat with a head restraint system that one without, and this is the only one on the market that I am aware of.  But it needs work and the strap issue must be addressed immediatly by the buyer so that your child does not loosen their own shoulder harness.",3
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"I am a loyal Britax user.  We have 3 Britax car seats.  I purchased the Wizard for my 6 month old because of the ""improved side-impact protection"".  While I am certain my child would be very protected in the event of a collision, we will never be able to see because he won\'t sit in the seat for more than 10 seconds.  The headrest wraps completely around the sides of the head, which not only prevents movement, it prevents him from seeing anything that is not directly in front of him.  So, he can\'t see out the car window.  He is bored, and seems to feel completely trapped.  I would definitely not recommend this car seat.  Try the Marathon or Roundabout instead--they are great!",2
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"We have had our Wizard for almost 2 years now.  We got it when my daughter grew too tall for her infant carrier but still needed to be rear facing.  She was 10 months old when we purchased the seat and we were able to keep her rear facing until she was 14 months old because of this seat.  She will be 3 years old this spring and has never been able to escape from this seat...not that she hasn\'t tried.  She has become so acustom to the head restraints that she fusses when she rides in Nana\'s car...Nana has a Century seat with no headrest.We spend a lot of time in the car and naptime often happens while she rides.  The head restraints have been a God send.  We don\'t have to fight with ""travel pillows"" and her head never flops forward.  She has slept peacefully on many 12 and 13 hour car trips as well as trips around town.  The sides are open enough she can reach her cupholder and her toys, but they are high enough to keep her tucked safely inside!I love the fact that I have never had to un-LATCH her seat to adjust the straps on the seat.  With the fully adjustable turn nob and the adjustable pull strap in the front, once her seat is LATCHed in, it\'s in!  That means more safety for my child and peace of mind for me.The only thing I\'m not crazy about is the difficulty removing the cover for cleaning.  But that is something so minor, I don\'t feel it detracts from the seat at all.  I just wish this seat would have been around 10 years ago for my son!",5
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,I bought this car seat for my 6 month old son almost a month ago. I have 2 other children(6&8) and I drive a ford focus. I didn\'t think it would fit but it did! My son loves the wings. It supports his head while he\'s sleeping. Best of all I bought it online at babiesrus.com for only $135.00!!! It retails for $269.00!!!,5
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"My son was born big and remains in the 90th percentile in height at 20 months old.  I had the Graco infant car seat from day one, but my son started to hate being in it by the age of 5 1/2 months.  I continued to compare convertible car seats and decided on the Wizard as I saw him quickly approaching 20lbs. My husband could not understand why I would want to spend over [...] on a car seat, but I told him that it was the best on the market and I will not compromise our son\'s safety to save and extra dollar.  I am willing to pay the extra for excellent quality.  He realized I meant business when I told him that I would get it with or with out his help!My son started to use the Wizard car seat rear facing at 7 months and we were all in heaven.  He loved being up like a big boy and it is easy for us to adjust the straps with the change of the seasons (for clothing).  I also love some little features (a pocket for the top latch straps; side locks to secure the shoulder belt if forced to install the seat either on the left or Right side of the vehicle rather than the recommended center; Velcro to hold the straps in place while removing or placing child in car seat; soft pads to cover plastic on shoulder straps/harnesses and a cushion for bottom harness buckle).  The color is great for a boy or girl (remember infants and toddlers can be quite messy).We are by far rich, but this car seat is woth every penny and continues to grow with my son.FYI . . . I contacted Britax re: the recall and I was happy to hear that it was a voluntary recall by the company.  I was also told the complaints of the straps feathering came from families who had their car seat for well over 4 years.  It was just basic wear and tear after an extended period of time.  Wow a car seat that is still considered a family favorite and re-sued after 4 years must be great (even if this practice is not recommended).  Britax still sent me a replacement strap for my brand new car seat (fall 2004).  Wonderful!  1 year later, the car seat is in mint condition!  If I decide to transition my son to a high back booster when he out grows his Wizard car seat, guess which band I will be purchasing?!",5
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"I have been researching these car seats and according to Britax\'s website ([...] the Wizard seat is for rear-facing infants 5 to 33 pounds and forward-facing children at least one year old from 20 to 65 pounds, just like the similar Marathon and Roundabout seats Britax makes.  I\'m not sure why Amazon has different information, but I thought I should let everyone know.  I haven\'t actually bought the seat yet, but I gave it 5 stars since you are required to rate the item.  It gets high marks from Consumer Reports and is the first child restraint seat (according to Britax, of course) to have side-impact protection.",5

Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"This is one of, if not the best, car seats on the market.  As for the recall that was mentioned in another review, that recall involved seats last year (2004) and it has been resolved.  I actually waited to get one of the newly manufactured Marathon seats in the fall of last year for my daughter because I knew the Britax seats were the best, and the covers were very cute!  They are easy to install, with or without LATCH.  They are easy to use - no twisted straps, easy to adjust the tightness of the straps, etc.  And, if you look at the leading consumer rating magazine/website, they also agree that Britax makes the best, and safest, convertible seats on the market.  It\'s certainly worth the extra money.",5

Large Black Microfiber Tote,"This is a great diaper bag if you need to cart around half the world with you. This is the kind of diaper bag you need if you\'re going to be out all day. We frequently use it for all-day trips out of town and the like. It has enough room for everything.I like how everything is compartmentalized. The changing pad is a GREAT extra.The downside though is, even unloaded, the diaper bag itself is very heavy. Loaded down with enough diapers, wipes, milk containers, and blankies for an entire day out, and it topples the stroller!Also, there really isn\'t a good place for purse items (wallet, keys, sunglasses etc).I had hoped to use this diaper bag for everything, but it\'s just too heavy for daily use. I\'m considering getting one of the backpack style ones for day-to-day use.",4

Those baggies have contained all of my son\'s messes, and, the odors!  I love the pacifier holder that is right on the strap!  No digging around in a bag for the pacifier!  It is a big (and heavy) bag when packed, but it is very convenient and even my husband likes it.  :)",5
Large Black Microfiber Tote,"I can\'t call this a large bag as I also have the Catini Colorado Backpack, which is what I consider large, maybe extra large, and was essential to me when I had a newborn, a toddler, and a child that was still having accidents and needed to carry so much, including extra shirts for myself because I had a spitter.Once my baby got older, switched to table foods (so I only have to carry a snack instead of jars or bowls of mush) and had been on cups for awhile (also not drinking as much, so one cup that held water could be refilled and I just had to carry that and a milk cup if we would be out for naptime), I wanted something smaller.I still had a graco diaper bag that I had used when my boys were little, but I had hated it then and found I hated it even more.  It was falling apart and didn\'t hold it\'s shape at all, just as I\'d remembered, even when I cut a piece of cardboard to fit the bottom to see if that would help.I finally bit the bullet and bought this bag because it seemed to have everything, including that wonderful changing pad, which I love.... the detached zipper pouch works ideally for wipes and I love that the inside liner comes out for cleaning.I typically will carry the water cup in the zipper cooler compartment and it keeps it refrigerator temperature for hours.  I carry the milk cups and the boys\' small bottles of water with an ice pack in the big front area and the zipper bag of wipes in the front most pocket.on the inside, I carry my changing pad, 6-8 size 5 diapers, 2 pull-ups, and balmex if I need it.  I love the secret compartment for my wallet, and the extra pockets on the straps (I don\'t have a cell phone) are great for a tube of lip gloss, change, or holding pacifiers for younger babies, if you have one)the strap is so comfortable and I love those two straps with snaps for attaching it to my strollers... especially on the Peg Perego P3, as it has those loops just for a diaper bag to be attached, leaving the handles free for whatever purchases I have to make.The only reason I gave this bag 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have liked the big strap to be adjustable and for the straps that attach it to the stroller to be longer (maybe adjustable) to make it easier to attach to my p3 without making it harder for my boys to access the toddler steps and to make it easier to attach to my double stroller which is a sbs with only two handles... I have to go under the canopy and attach it to the bar that divides the seats...",4
Large Black Microfiber Tote,"I am a mother of a 5 month old and pregnant again! This bag is the best bag ever!!! It has replaced two diaper bags plus my purse and it is barely bigger than one of my old diaper bags.1. There is a pocket for everything, plus extra zipper bags for more.2. It has a thermal bottle chamber, since I only breastfeed I use it to carry my digital camera, it keeps the camera from being damaged in the sun or overheating in the bag when left in the car.3. All compartments that can be opened from the outside of the bag have dual closure protection (zipper and velcro), unlike all the other bags I have viewed at the store and I have no worries that something will fall out or get stolen out of the bag when I am carrying it around. And the velcro is very very thick.4. The color is fantastic and the fabric is sturdy and well put together5. The carry strap saves your back and is very easy to carry.6. It has straps on the back so it can attach onto a lightweight stroller, I personally use them to carry an umbrella (since I still use my full size stroller) but they can be used for tons of things, you can even use them to carry toys, just loop the toys around the strips and snap closed.7. The liner is nice but I just pulled it out, I use zipper bags instead for organization and pulling the liner out gave me more room.8. This bag even has a pacifier holder, and GREAT cell phone holder (cell phones are small and every cell phone holder I have seen on other diaper bags swallow my cell phone and I spend ten minutes digging it out and miss the call.9. Husband not bothered by carrying this bag, no Disney characters, or flowers and such.10. Also the bag has built in antimicrobial protection that cannot be washed away for life!Hey I could go on and on and on. This bag is great great great. I am now a one diaper bag woman instead of three!",5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"This is the best thing besides the bouncer that my daughter loves.  My daughter can spend an hour or more underneath it!  She ""trys"" to talk to the bird when it hasn\'t moved in awhile!  (She\'s almost 3months old but loved it since Day 1. Soon she\'ll be able to explore all the stuff on the mat when she gets more tummy time! I totally recommend this item!!!!!!",5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My daughter is 3 months old, and seems to enjoy this toy.  I am hoping as she gets a little older she will like it even more.  She watches the bird ""fly"" and reaches for and kicks at the hanging toys.",4
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My daughter loves this......we just add a couple of extra link-a-doos so she can reach the toys and we get entertainment for an hour or more.  She really likes the music and watching the blue bird move.  So much so, that she often grabs at the blue bird.  She\'s pretty strong, and it\'s held up great.  She\'s used it consistently for 2 months now and I expect we\'ll get another few months out of it.",5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"This is a great gym overall. The bright colors and textures and good for keeping baby entertained. My daughter loves to listen to the music and watch the bird move. My only complaint is that you can\'t move the gym and it\'s easy to collapse. The arches are only held to the mat by flimsy velcro tabs. Overall, it\'s a wonderful gym, thus the 4 star rating. However, I hope the manufacturer will consider making an updated version with a sturdier way to hold it together.",4
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,My son is 4.5 months old and he still likes this playmat.  He has been using it since he was about a month old.  I have had no troubles with the bird coming off (and he does pull on it and grab it.)  The bird does stop moving and playing music but I figured out why...it\'s to encourage the baby to hit the toys.  As soon as any of the hanging toys move the music and bird start up again.All in all this was a great bargain and my son really likes it,5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"This Gym is amazing.  My VERY active 5month old still plays with it all the time.  He has literally tried to dismember the bird in the center, but it is still going strong.  He loves the music and all of his ""bug friends"".  Now he scoots around and looks at the bugs on the mat as well.  It the best toy we have bought so far.",5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My son really enjoyed this mat when he was 3-9 months old.  He watched the bird, batted at the toys, and pulled at the mat.  The toys are very durable and colorful.  Like most of these mats, the construction is a bit unstable.  We had a friend\'s child over, and he tried to pull himself up using the bars and fell because the velcro came undone on the bottom (that\'s what holds them in place) and the bars tipped over.  Ouch.  Once my son was a little older, he started to pull the bird off.  It seemed like his mission...  The bird always worked though.  The bird is motion activated, but you can change that.  The mat wasn\'t created with shoulder straps or snaps to help with transport, which would have been nice.  The lights held my son\'s attention, and the music was calming and not too loud.  The mat is machine washable.",4
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My daughter has been in love with the Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Musical Gym since she was only a couple of weeks old. I think I owe my sanity to this play mat. Ava was the type of newborn who needed to be held at all times. Needless to say it was impossible to get anything done around my house. Until I decided to give this play mat a try. It was the only way she was content when I put her down. She couldn\'t be bothered with her swing or bouncy seat or anything. She loved the cause and effect she got from batting at the bird with her hands or from kicking her feet. The movement causes the bird to chirp, flap its wings,swing back and forth and play music and lights. It makes her very excited. The hanging toys are a great quality and can be moved to change it up to avoid boredom.  She is now 5 months old and continues to discover  new ways to play with this toy. I bring it EVERYWHERE with me, including the beach. She has found new toys she like as well but continues to enjoy this one just as much as she always has. She loves it so it was a life saver for me. She has a different one at my mother-in-laws house but is not as interested in that one. 5 stars all the way!",5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"my daughter loves it, she\'s two months old but she loves watching the bird and the lights and listening to the music.",4
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"Love this playmat... the only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is that it lacks a ""kicking option"".  To take care of that problem I bought the wind chimes in the playmat area and they hook to this gym and my baby can kick at those.  He loves to watch the bird and it is pleasant to listen to.",4
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My son loves this gym. But I have a few complaints about this product. 1st the bird in the center falls off when he pulls on it, He is only 4 months old. 2nd the music skips and stops. I had to tape up the battery compartment for the music to work. I guess that even when it is screwed tight the batteries are not in the right place. This product is easy to bring back and forth to grandmas.",4
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,I bought it for my daughter when she was about 4 months old. If I would of known she was going to love it i would have got it sooner. She had so much fun and kept her very entertained. She outgrew pretty soon. I recomned you buy when baby is 2 months.,5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My daughter has loved this toy since birth.  At first she was only captivated by the moving bird, the lights and the music (you can make it where it is not motion activated but can instead run steady for quite a while) because she was too young to bat at the toys. Gradually she could reach the toys (I added extra links to them to make them closer to her) and then the fun really began. I rotate the toys often to make it a whole new experience and especially love the extra loops to hang additional toys from (there are 8 hanging loops in all plus 4 extra ones around the edge of the mat)- so now I have 12 toys attached that I switch around and bring different ones into the mix when I see she isn\'t interested in certain ones. It holds her attention for maybe 20 minutes or so- long enough to get a few chores done or to catch up on my email or bills. She has been able to reach the bird for quite sometime now, but hasn\'t successfully pulled it off (although she\'s tried very hard to) so I have found it to be very durable.  The batteries last a long time too which is always a plus.  I do think the bird hangs down too low, but if you don\'t place your child directly under it it doesn\'t seem to be a problem. Adorable and worth the money!",5
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"I FIRST GOT THIS OUT FOR MY SON AT 4 WKS AND HE SEEMED DISINTERESTED. I BROUGHT IT OUT AGAIN A FEW WEEKS LATER AND HE SEEMED MUCH MORE INTERESTED. AT FIRST HE JUST STARED AT THE BIRD, THEN HE STARTED GRABBING AND KICKING AT THE HANGING TOYS. HE LAUGHS AND SMILES AND HAS LOTS OF FUN. THERE ARE TWO SMALL PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS TOY:1)IT SEEMS LIKE THE TOYS THAT HANG ON THE LOOPS EITHER HANG TOO LOW OR TOO HIGH. I HAD TO ADJUST THE TOYS TO MAKE TYHEM THE RIGHT HEIGHT. 2) AFTER A WEEK, THE BIRDS HEAD CAME OFF. IT REATTACHED EASILY, BUT IT FALLS OFF EASILY TOO.",4
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My daughter absolutly fell in love with this gym. We have the cradle Fischer Price swing (lullaby nature one) and it also has flying birds and butterflys. She really enjoyed that, so we went out and got this play gym. She could spend an hour under hear easily without wanting to come out and loved to smack the toys.The toys also remove and now that she is older and sits up on her own, she plays with the toys in her hands and in the bathtub.  We also bought additional toys to hang on the loops and change them out with Chimes and others so she doesnt get bored (although that hasnt happened yet).We bought a Bumbo seat so she could sit up on her own and pulled the bumbo seat up to the toys and bird on this gym and she played with it sitting up very easily.The only downside that i think it had was that when my girl was younger and didnt have as much motion, the bird wouldnt move (since its motion activated) since it couldnt detect her...i would just sit near and bump it with my foot to get it going again..i think it really helped her learn to \'talk\' since she was always cooing at it.I was very pleased w/ my purchase.",5

Now that he is a little older and faces out, the neck support is support flap is supposed to tuck under, but it keeps getting in the way. Alex just chews on it when it doesn\'t shimmy up over his eyes. I haven\'t tried it on my back yet. The whole system is a bit uncomfortable for me, but better than some I\'ve tried. If you lean forward just a little, the baby flops away from you, though. I must admit, I don\'t know what I\'d do without it while watching both my baby and my sister\'s 11-month old, though!",2
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"This carrier is GREAT!  I had gotten one for my first son (5 years old now) & couldn\'t find it to try with my newborn.  I wasn\'t all that thrilled with the prospect of reusing my old one since it wasn\'t all that comfortable anyway (major back strain after using it too long).  Snugli has REALLY done well with this one!  The top back strap combined with the wide waistband make this a real backsaver.  Please don\'t buy one of these without a waist-strap/back-strap combination!  You\'ll so regret it!  The zippered vent for baby\'s head makes it so much better ventilated than older versions.  The removable wallet is useful to hold pacifier or small necesities (keys, for example).  I am thrilled that I chose to purchase this--and so is my new baby boy!  ;-)",5
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"I would recommend this carrier to anyone. I have no problem with back pain or the carrier not fitting and I am small framed(5\'4""). I use it mostly with my baby on my back since I use it when I work and it is akward to work around my baby. Both my babies still fit into it and I can be comfortable for hours. My only complaint is that it is falling apart. The stitching is actually pulling out! I won\'t replace it since my youngest baby is not far from walking and I don\'t use it often for my older baby but I wish it would have lasted longer because it is so great. I have had it for about 19 months and used it at least 2-3 days a week. It was impossible to use during the last 2 months of my pregnancy w/baby #2 but my husband used it alot as well.",4
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"I had absolutely no problems with the snugli.  I love it and my son loves it.  It\'s a GREAT workout and despite questions about my back, it hasn\'t bothered me one bit.  It is a little tricky but what pack is not.Only thing I don\'t like is the zip part up front.  When your baby faces out you have to fold that down into the bottom so they can see out and it kinda scrunches their legs in there but other then that I love it and that part is not that big a deal.Everyone talks about what a good baby he is but it\'s the snugli that keeps him happy and included on what\'s going on.",5
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,This carrier seems to be a great idea and does provide you with hands free carrying of your baby and that in itself is a god sent.  I have problems getting my baby in and out of it.  The snaps or clips that are on the side of seat part are a pain to get on or off.  I can never get them on or off without a struggle and often end up just giving up and loading baby from the top and pulling him out when were done using it.  Overall its a great idea but those clips need some work or a better design would be great.  Overall its a great carrier and doesnt put a whole lot of strain on my back and its fairly easy to slip on and off if you leave some of the straps fastened all the time.  I am petite 5\'1 and dont have any height issues with it at all.,3
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"This is the only product that my husband and I registered for where we did no research about brands.  After receiving it, and actually asking around, we realized that we had made a mistake.  There are multiple snaps and straps, and although I\'ve found a relatively quick way to place my daughter in it, it is still way more time consuming than other brands.  I\'ve watched mothers in my playgroup quickly slide their babies into their Baby Bjorns and other similar products, while I am still standing there snap, snap, snapping.  Furthermore, the headrest that was supposed to assist my daughter when wearer-facing has become quite a hindrance now that she is forward-facing.  I have recently gone to a store and tried out other carriers with my daughter and none of them bring on the lower-back-pain that I have wearing this carrier.  If you want to save money and do not plan on wearing this carrier often, maybe this would be the carrier for you.  But now I will have to go out and spend more money to buy something that works quickly, easily, and pain-free!",2
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"We adopted our son at 5 months in Guatemala - this was an absolute life (and arm!) saver.  Some people mention that this is too big for newborns, I can\'t address that as I didn\'t try it. Our son was big enough to be outward-facing on the front and he loved it. He loves being carried, held and walked around, and this saved our arms from falling off. He loves watching everything that is going on around him and he hated being strapped into a stroller or car seat, so I used this and walked as much as possible.Now he\'s big enough to be on my back - and it\'s even more comfortable and convenient for me. The one downside is that I can\'t see him when he\'s on my back, but that\'s what mirrors are for (or store windows, or car windows,etc.).  With him safely behind me, I can even cook dinner without having to put him down.It did take a few tries to get the hang of putting it on by myself, but it\'s possible and really not difficult. I loved this thing and can\'t imagine what we would have done without it.UPDATE: My son is now 10-months and I still use this regularly. Having him in the backpack is great for getting stuff done, and having him on the front facing in is fantastic for getting him to take naps when he is fussy or there is a lot going on.",5
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"This carrier was such a pain! It has so many straps and adjustments that it was a project that required the help of my husband to put on and take off. Our son just looked uncomfortable in it and I was also uncomfortable with the skinny little shoulder straps. We attempted to use it a handful of times and each time gave up because it was uncomfortable.I tried some of the other brands that were more expensive but they were so much more comfortable they would have been well worth the extra money. In the end I did not purchase another carrier, but I would recomment either spending a little more on a higher quality carrier or not buying one at all.",1
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"A great idea to make it a front and back carrier, but the Baby Bjorn is still easier to put on and take off, which we also have. I didn\'t like the multiple straps to have to adjust each time my husband and I took turns with it. It\'s a fine carrier if you don\'t have to adjust it a lot for another person. In addition, this carrier wasn\'t comfortable on my short and petite frame. The waist belt was too wide and the straps had a ""luggage"" feel to them unlike the cloth straps of the Bjorn. The straps of this Snugli were also too long for my frame. HOWEVER, this Snugli allowed my baby to have a better field of vision when she was positioned in the front and facing me. I also liked the vent. I do think that the Bjorn is exorbitantly priced (although an excellent product) and if you plan to use a carrier often, a Snugli Comfort Vent is easier to take on and off than the Snugli Front and Back Pack carrier and much more reasonably priced than the Baby Bjorn if you don\'t need the back carrier function. Above all, I preferred the Maya Wrap for even greater versatility and ease to pack for travelling.",3
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"This carrier has been nice to use when I walk my dog or go shopping instead of bringing a stroller.  The shoulder padding tends to slide around since they are not attached to the straps.  When this does happen, the straps dig into my shoulder.  Also, it took quite some time before my son was able to face forward.  He could hold his head well enough long before he was tall enough to face forward, but my baby didn\'t mind facing me.  Some similar carriers fold down by the babies face so they can face forward easier.",2
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"The carrier is a great price, but I found that you can definitely do with out this product.  We bought it for my husband thinking he would use it when he goes out as opposed to a stroller, but the carrier is just too bulky and my daughter is uncomfortable in it, as well as my husband.  I would definitely save your money, we\'ve had it for 5 months and still haven\'t used it.",3
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"We\'ve used this carrier for hiking and around the house. It\'s great to use when there\'s someone to help you put it on.However (as another reviewer notes above) there are 2 buckles and 2 slide/lock clasps to deal with. You can ""pre-lock"" two of the clasps and one of the slides. But the remaining ones need to remain open in order to put the baby into the carrier. Unfortunately, this makes the carrier next to impossible to attach by yourself. The slide clasp is particularly frustrating, as the baby waits (typically impatiently) to be placed into the carrier.Also the pouch in the front is too small to hold much more than a cell phone, so don\'t expect to carry your diaper/bottles in the carrier.Overall, this is a good product that could use some ergonomic improvements considering the need for fast in/out of baby and more storage.",3
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"This carrier is way too bulky and a complete pain to put on.  I registered for it after reading some favorable reviews but wish I didn\'t.  I am going to try another brand.  If your baby is small you have to pull all the straps so much that you have tons of things dangling all over the place.  It is hard to get her in and out of it without major disruption to her, and no matter how I adjust it the left shoulder continually slips for me.  It is also too small in the waist adjustment for my husband who is a pretty big guy. I thought the Bjorn carriers were overpriced but I am going to try another brand.  Very disappointed.",2
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,I wish I used this item.  Baby doesn\'t seem comfortable and no matter how I adjust it I feel like I have it on wrong.  I really think this would be a great item for me and baby but it just doesn\'t seem to fit my baby\'s idea of a good fit.,3
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"When Nathan was first born, this carrier was our way to soothe him when nothing else worked!  My husband or I would place him in the carrier and walk -- putting Nathan to sleep!As months passed, we discovered many other ways this carrier was handy.  I use it to get housework done, Nate helps me make cookies in it, we walk together, and he is much happier for longer periods of time in the store in this than he is in the cart.  For alert babies that are happiest to see what is going on, this is the way to go!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We bought this for our son when he was 3 months old because we were having trouble putting him to sleep in his crib at night. He loved it! We would do our nightly routine of reading a book, and then I would turn this on, lay him down and he would watch it until he drifted off to sleep. He\'s now 6 months old, and he still loves it.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I purchaced the Flutterbye Soother for my daughter who was 1 1/2 months at the time.  She is now 3 months old and loves to watch the little birdies go around.  It is very cute and enjoyable. My older kids get a kick out of it too. They love the night light show. Very soothing! We ALL love it!!,4
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,Our little one used to cry when put in the crib; until this! An absolute favorite for all of us; very soothing indeed.,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We were given the Aquarium and were very disappointed with the labored motor sounds. (Same issue we had with the original Aquarium four years ago.) Flutterbye does not have this problem. We love it, and most importantly, baby loves it. Worth the money.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My daughter has used this soother since her early weeks, she is now 9 months old.  She absolutely loves it.  It helps her to go to sleep at night, even in the middle of tremendous teething pain.  She loves to watch the birdies light up projected on the ceiling and inside the actual toy.  There are several different melodies to choose from and also bird sounds and ocean waves.  This toy has been a real sleep aid for all of us.  I highly recommend it.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We could not live without this,used it every day since baby was 3 months old and now he is 15 months!  It teaches them to fall asleep in the crib and if they wake they just turn it on.  The bird is super easy to push.  Has like 7 different \'song/sounds\' but we like the music the best.  He bangs on it and moves all the on off buttons and it still works great!  A MUST have!  Better than a mobile anyday.GREAT GIFT!!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We bought this crib toy for my daughter when she was 4 months old and still in our bedroom. It was quiet and allowed us to get sleep as well as calmed her. She is now 8 months and in her own room and it\'s still just as awesome. Both the light show and the projections are beautiful, soft, and soothing. I cant imagine putting her to sleep in her room without it.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I received the soother while I was pregnant with my daughter and have used it at naptime and bedtime EVERY DAY since.  I don\'t even travel without it.  My daughter will be one in February and she is now able to control the music on her own.  She will literally get up during the night and turn her music on and go back to sleep.  This toy has been an absolute life saver.  Every mother to be should have one!,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"I bought this after looking for a mobile that doesn\'t need wound up.  It never fails, that my 2 month old was almost asleep when her mobile would shut off, and she would wake up when I wound it up.  In the month I\'ve had this, she has not cried once when going to bed, and is fast asleep before it shuts(plays for 8 minutes).  If, in rare cases, I need to play it again, all it takes it pushing one button - which doesn\'t startle her and defeat my previous efforts. I am buying this for all the baby showers I go to from this point on!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I love love love this product! We have twin babies and have purchased similar items for the light show which really helps them to fall asleep. This one is the best simply for the fact that the bulb nevers burns out. We have both the starry night and ocean wonders light show/monitors which totally SUCK! I think it\'s because this one runs on batteries and doesn\'t short the bulb out. We were ALWAYS having that problem with the other ones. The little birdies are so adorable too!,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,This wonderful toy has many options to make your baby calm and intertained. It projects a cute scenery of the sun butterflies and animals on your ceiling and on the front the little birdies are moving their heads and wings. It is absolutely adorable. The music lasts for 10 minutes of so and that is great when you dont have to wind up a toy every minute.I give it 5 stars.,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"I bought this for my new daughter and she seems to love it. I love the fact that the music isn\'t annoying. And I love the ceiling display. I own the ocean wonders aquarium which is still in my older daughters room she still loves that so much she didn\'t want to pass it on to the new baby. Although I know I wouldn\'t buy the Ocean Wonders Aquarium again, I would buy this one again.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"He has had this attached to his crib since he was about 4 months old, when he can actually appreciate it, and has LOVED it since.  I use to play it FOR him, and then as he moved through his milestones, it becam more enjoyable for him.  When he started crawiling he would crawl to it, he began standing to touch it, and so on. Now he wakes up in the morning and just pushes the button to turn it on, and still really enjoys it.  I bought another one just to have as back up in case this fails, BUT it has held up great!!!!! Highly recommend this. I also have to say the picture on the ceiling works so very well, and really is soothing!!!!!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I\'m a mother of a 9 week old baby girl.  She absolutely loves this crib toy.  She lays there and just stares at it for hours in total amazement.  She would lay there for ever and watch it if she didn\'t fall asleep to the beautiful music.  I can\'t wait to go to the store and buy the matching mobile.  This is a great toy for any baby.  I love this product.,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My daughter at 11 months is transitioning to her crib. I really liked the old fisher price aquarium but can\'t find it anywhere. So, for the past 2 weeks I have been rocking her to sleep but she insists on moving around to keep herself awake. After about 20 minutes I just lay her in her crib and she screams and cries. I decided to buy a crib toy in hopes to sooth herself to sleep. I had 3 choices placed in front of me and I decided to go with the Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies. No more crying! She loves the light show, I must admit that it is cute and the music is relaxing. She also plays with it in the morning giving me extra sleep time--that\'s ALWAYS a bonus! I certainly recommend at least trying it out. I just hope that it lasts longer than several months, which is what one review stated.*Updated* Almost a year later and the toy is going strong. The only downfall is that it does suck batteries but that\'s to be expected with the movement, lightshow, AND music. I\'m glad I invested into it.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"I bought this for my 18-month old about 3 weeks ago.  So far, we love it.  She can turn it on and off herself which we all love!  I love the fact that we can change the play modes so the ceiling projector only works at night to help save batteries.  Plus it has different volumes which is nice also.  Overall, we really like it and my daughter loves to mimic the bird noises!  A little pricey, but worth it if it helps them wind down at night or keeps them busy when they wake up!",4
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I am the mom of a newborn who is VERY fussy...I found the only thing that will calm my son down at night is when I put on the Flutterbye Birdies soother...after about 15 minutes the music automaticlly stops and when I go into my son\'s room he is usually asleep already..This product is great...,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,We registered for this product because it we thought it was so sweet.  Once we actually put it in our new daughters crib and turned it on we found it to be adorable.  Even our six year old loves the ceiling projected images and sweet nature sounds.  Perfect crib toy!,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We recieved this item as a gift when our son was 2 months old.  He has used it almost every night since then. It plays several differnt musical pieces that soothe and relax our son, and it projects an image of birds and butterflies and the sun and moon on to the ceiling.  He likes to watch this as he drifts off to sleep.  He is now 6 months old and he still loves it, he has also just begun to notice the birds in the actual base of the projector.  He likes that part too.  I think that this is a very good item to have.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My son had the first aquarium one and he still (at almost 3) likes it, but he constantly wants to play with his sister\'s bird one!  As the other reviews stated, it is awesome for soothing, though I have yet to use the ceiling feature - my 4-1/2 mo. old likes to sleep on her side.  She really likes the movement with the light.The one thing I don\'t care for is that it eats through batteries MUCH faster than the my son\'s aquarium one.  I\'m already on a 2nd set of batteries!!!  Just wish there were rechargables for the larger sized batteries!!!Don\'t hesitate to get this one!",4
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My son loves this toy.  We use it at every nap and at bedtime.  The music soothes him, and he loves watching the birdies on the ceiling, it knocks him out in no time. I wish it would run longer than 10 minutes, but that\'s average for these types of toys.  It also eats batteries, but again, that\'s average.  I would look into rechargeable batteries in general!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My son is 5 months old and he got this for Christmas from ""Santa"".  He will not got ot sleep usless this is playing.  If he wakes up in the middle of the night all I have to do is go in find his binky and press the button and he is sound asleep again in seconds.  This soother is awsome.  It keeps me sleeping longer at night.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My 9 month old daughter had the aquarium, but I thought this was so cute, so I put both in her crib.  I didn\'t realize how much she loved it until one night she had such trouble falling asleep - was crying for an hour - and I couldn\'t figure out why...it turns out the Flutterbye had accidentally been turned off.  As soon as it was turned back on I didn\'t hear from her the rest of the night!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I bought this toy for my daughter who at the time was 1 month old and it actually caught her attention.  She was asleep within minutes. She is now 2 months and she smiles everytime I turn it on for her. The music is so relaxing it even puts my husband to sleep. I was going to buy the Aquariam crib toy but this one caught my attention and I dont regret buying it.  Moms if you want your baby asleep fast this is a MUST have.,5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We were desperate for anything to help our baby sleep! This is a time in your life where you would almost do anything for sleep! We had a hard time getting her down at night. A friend told me about this and I went out the next day and bought it! We tried it for a week and just let her get used to it! Then we started turning it on and leaving her in the crib awake. The first night it took almost 3hrs to get her down. We would go in every 7 minutes and turn it back on. The second night it only took us 30 minutes to get her to sleep. Now we are down to 15 minutes and sometimes less than that! She does not cry at all!We all love the different sounds, especially the one that sounds like ocean waves and windchimes! Also love the fact that there are different volume settings and you can have just music or just projection. Our baby also loves the projection on the ceiling!Be prepared to purchase lots of D batteries! They go out pretty fast for us! The only things I would really hope that Fisher Price changes is adding a remote feature so you are not walking in every 7 minutes to turn it on (it would be so nice just to press a remote button instead of going in the room to touch the button)and also lengthening the time it plays, considering that it takes a normal baby at least 20 minutes to fall asleep!The motor is a litle noisy, but it just reminds me of the way an IV pump sounds in the hospital.We have a convertible crib where the area it hangs is larger than most cribs and it fits just fine!!!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"I bought this because my daughter enjoyed her Aquarium crib toy for so long, that I thought she would like birds for a change, and it had such good reviews.It\'s very cute, but I think the aquarium one is much more soothing with the bubbles and the fish.  Maybe it\'s me, but I think aquarium sounds are more relaxing than chirping birds.I had to mount this on the wall side of the crib because if I mounted it on the other side, a ceiling fixture got in the way.  If the crib is too close to the wall, you can\'t see the whole light show.  Part of it is lost on the wall, so I was a little disappointed in that.The on/off button is kind of small compared to the aquarium, and it\'s off to one side as opposed to in the middle.  It was very easy for my daughter to just put her hand out and turn her aquarium on by herself in the middle of the night when she needed to be soothed back to sleep, but this button is hard to find by a baby.I guess I\'ll keep it because it is cute, but I\'m definitely leaving the aquarium in her crib too.",4
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"I\'ve had this for 4 months now and haven\'t changed the batteries yet.  This soother has different tunes as well as moving birds and even a light show for baby to watch.  I have found a favorite song and play it every night for my son and he goes right to sleep. It\'s so soothing that I enjoy listening to it over the monitor at night.  It plays the tune 4 or 5 times I believe and that is plenty of time for my son to fall asleep.  When he gets older I\'ll start using the light show and moving birdies but for now, he\'s perfectly happy just listening to the soothing music for a long nights sleep.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My son loves his \'birds\'.  The music lasts longer than most baby lullaby mobiles and such - and gives your child longer to fall asleep.  It has 3 songs, womb noises and bird tweets, or just bird tweets.  It has 3 settings including just music without lights, music with lighted birds moving, and music with a lighted ceiling display.  Now that my son is older he can turn it on or off by pressing the blue bird, he can stand up and switch the songs and the settings.  He loves it and it\'s worth every penny and more!  It has 4 D batteries so get rechargeables and have 2 sets to swap in and out.  And pull out the white cords that go under the batteries for supposed easy release of batteries; the back doesn\'t close with them under the batteries and my son pulled out one white cord and could have tried to swallow it!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"When we moved our baby out of the bassinet in our room and into the crib in her room at 7 weeks, we were relieved to find that the Flutterbye Soother helped her to fall asleep much more easily than she had in our room.  She loves watching the light show on the ceiling, and I think she also finds the music comforting.  During the day she also enjoys watching the birds move on the soother itself.  A must-have in my opinion!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My daughter was very difficult to get to sleep the first four months of her life. I would put her down and she would scream until I picked her up again. Then I got the Flutterbye Lullaby Birdies Soother and my sanity was saved!  When I first got it she loved it. but after a couple of days she cried when I turned it on...I think because she knew it was time to sleep.  It took about a week before she got used to it.  After that, I would put her in her crib and she would automatically look up to the ceiling waiting for me to put it on.  Now, I put her in her crib wide awake (of course drowsy and ready for sleep), turn on the flutterbye, walk out the door and don\'t hear from her again for 2-3 hours for her nap or for her bedtime I don\'t hear from her until the morning time.  I\'m guessing she watches it until it turns off and then falls asleep or else she falls asleep while it\'s on.  I was a little concerned that maybe she was getting addicted to this and then we would be back to the same problem...not knowing how to comfort herself to put herself to sleep so one night I didn\'t put it on and she still went right to sleep without tears.  One problem I did find is if you don\'t tip toe back into the room and turn off the automatic button, she would press the button in the middle of the night and it would scare her.  She hasn\'t done that in a long time.  I think maybe because she\'s older and the crib is further down and she would have to stand up to turn it on.I recommend this 100%.  My four year old would even take a nap watching this.  It\'s cute.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"I have a 5 month old who never sleeps.  This product is wonderful.  He loves to look up and see the projection on the ceiling.  The music is soothing and puts him to sleep.  There is also an auto shut-off which is wonderful for me - I don\'t have to wait up to shut it off.  There are three volume levels for the music and many song choices.  If you have a baby that doesn\'t sleep well, I highly recommend this product.  It is a lifesaver.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"Good news is that this is amazing and my daughter LOVES it and it helps her sleep...bad news, she pushes the button all the time and we have to change the batteries maybe once a month.  Batteries aren\'t cheap!",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My son loves this!  He watches the birds intently as he wakes up, and gazes up at the ceiling while he falls asleep.  I actually caught him pressing the button to turn it on himself the other morning-- and was he ever pleased with himself!I like it because it\'s different from the typical boring toys.  A peaceful, beautiful crib accessory.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We recieved this as a gift for my one year old son after the original aquarium broke.  Even though my 1 year old likes it, my 4 year old loves it even more.  Since they share a room, this soothes both of them to sleep but if my younger one falls asleep before the older one, the older one gets up and turns this on to watch the ceiling show.  The projection is very clear and the music is nice.  My 1 year old turns this on himself to hear the music and watch the birds move around.  And after my son outgrows this as a crib toy, I can use it on a table in their room so they can still enjoy it.  I think this is even better than the original (2001) fisher price aquarium since the image on the ceiling is better and the birds are so cute.",5
Baby Snoopy Diaper Blue Cooler Bottle Bag New,It was very cute and made of good quality for the price I paid. It made a great baby gift.,5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I did some research on the different carriers before deciding on this one. It was the cheapest I could find and also looked like the most practical. I have a 2 month old daughter and she loves it! Within minutes of walking she\'s out like a light and looks extremely comfortable. The leg holes aren\'t too tight, there\'s adequate space for her arms and it supports her head wonderfully. Now I don\'t have to lug the stroller around everywhere and can also get stuff done around the house without her crying to be held!",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"This isn\'t my favorite carrier, but it\'s the only one my husband uses for our baby. It\'s very user-friendly and fits daddy well, even though he is a body builder with a wide chest and back. I think it\'s a great gift for dads-to-be!",4
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"this carrier was very good and def worth 20 dollars but i have my son facing forward in it because hes 15 pounds and the back support keeps rasing up, i know it says to fold it down but it just wont stay. but i pinned it down so now it works wonders. and its also  very good on my back!",4
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,My son really likes being held in the Snuggli and it does fit well on both me and my husband.  The reason I only gave it three stars is because at about 15 pounds it became _very_ tight on him (it\'s suppose to work up to 26 lbs.).  Why didn\'t the manufacturer make it adjustable to grow with the baby?  I guess that\'s why it\'s only $20.00!,3
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"This carrier is awesome!  We take it almost everywhere with us!  Our son HATES his carseat, and therefore, he doesn\'t exactly care for his stroller either.  If he is awake and we are shopping, we have to bring the snugli.  We\'ve been using it since he was one month old, and now he is three months.  It is very comfortable to wear and it is the only way he is content when we are shopping!  I was skeptical at first because the price was so cheap, and I always held my hand underneath him just in case a strap broke or something.  But it has proven to be secure, even with my now 15 pounder!  I would definitely recommend this product, especially for parents on the go!",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I don\'t know why all the bad reviews?  This is VERY simple to put baby in and out.  All you have to do is hold baby against your chest with one hand and latch both slide locks, then buckle near the head.  I\'ve used this through 2 babies (same carrier) and loved it.  I\'ve carried both children for hours through Disney World, sports games, etc with no problems and no back pain.  The more expensive ones are not worth it.  I\'ve used them and this works just as great.  Plus it has several different pockets to keep your phone, pacifiers, or anything you want.  Both of my babies would fall asleep within 5 minutes of walking in it every time!",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"This is a good carrier and a good price. I was tempted to purchase a top of the line carrier but decided I would try this one out. It worked great, I would carry my daughter while doing housework or visiting w/ neighbors outside. Baby would sleep the entire time. I did not wear it on my back, I only wore it in the front position when my daughter was a newborn. By the time she was old enough to be put in the back position, we had an excersausr and other alternatives instead of lugging her around all the time...",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"We were celebrating our daughters second birthday, which happen to also fall on mothers day and we were going to Sea World. Well I know strollers are a pain in some attractions so we decided to by this for our 7 month old son. Oh my gosh he loved it, he even fell asleep in it. It is really comfy I carried him around for awhile and I was 4 months pregnant at the time and it didnt bother me one bit. Now we use it for our ""new"" son and he loves it. We dont push the double stroller around anymore, if we head to the mall baby Chris gets to ride with mommy and daddy gets the stroller for Michael. I wish I would of bought this for baby #1 and not baby #3. I always thought this things were kinda silly looking but boy do I take back those words.",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"A nice, tightly designed little carrier, but not simple.  I\'m still not able to get the baby into it and then lift him while adjusting the straps and etc.  If you\'re very coordinated or you have someone else in the house all the time to help you, this is fine.  Otherwise, look further!",2
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I received this as a shower gift.  I\'ve used it many times.  I discovered that I really love to wear my baby as opposed to pushing her around in the stroller.  It\'s so nice to be able to ""hold"" her when she is upset and still have my hands free to do other things, like housework or cooking dinner.  I have several different baby carriers ranging from the snugli to ring slings.  My feelings on the snugli are this...It doesn\'t have any sort of back support and after a good hour or so of wearing my baby in the snugli, my back and neck are screaming.  I\'ve read that the snugli is bad for baby\'s hips, too, so that doesn\'t make me feel to great about it.  I recently borrowed the BEST carrier from a friend, it\'s called and ERGO baby carrier.  It is the best thing ever invented!!!!!  It is soft and supports my back and neck, ugh, I could go on and on and on.  I say, skip the cheesy snugli and invest in an ERGO!!!",2
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I like this carrier but after a while of having baby in it, it hurts your back!  Other than that I like it.  Why pay $90.00 for the same thing but diffrent name when you can get this one for a lot more less money.  I wear it for walks and doing house work.  My son likes it because he is close to me.",4
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"We were given a different more expensive brand, and I returned it. I could not understand why we would need a carrier for almost 3 times the amount that serves the same purpose. We have used this product during several outings and my husband doesnt mind using it. When my son was smaller and light my teenager was able to tote him around and he was happy.It does the trick and saves money",4
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"Our boy has outgrown the Snugli at 5.5 months old and 18 pounds. And it is true the baby flops around in it from side to side, it never quite felt secure to me.  However I must say the baby loved it, many times he would not go to sleep unless we\'d snugled him.  Which is both good and bad depending on the situation; if you have a bad back, you might as well forget this product.  We\'ve upgraded to the Playtex Hip Hammock now and it seems to do the job, the baby doesn\'t flop around, he fits much better (label says from 15 to 35 lbs).  Snugli of course is easier to adjust and use; but when well adjusted and used properly, the Playtex Hip Hammock might be more secure and safer.The Snugli is a good product for starters, you can carry full term newborns in it, we carried our boy in it a day after he came out of the hospital;  we had to make sure those legs were in the right place though!But I am very dissatisfied about the fact that they do exagerate in the weight, my boy doesn\'t fit correctly at 18 lbs how can they assume a 26 lbs baby would fit?  Its beyond me.  I tried placing him face forward, however it feels so awkward and the baby was truly unhappy and confused I decided to not do it at all.The baby in the picture may have not been used to being in a Snugli facing mommy or daddy, otherwise she would have been upset in the picture.",4
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"My child hates a stroller/carseat, so this product is handy & does save your back; however it\'s difficult to walk very fast because his legs hit mine as we walk-which jars him",3
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"This carrier is better than the Baby Bjorn. I returned the other one so I could by the Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier. It is light weight, extremely easy to put on and even easier to put your baby in. My daughter loves being in the snugli. This version is even better than the one my sister in law purchased 2 years ago. I\'m amazed at just how comfortable and easy this snugli is. I would highly recommend this carrier to any parent.",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"Yes, you heard me, this thing rocks over the Bjorn.  It\'s bigger, more comfortable and has more things on it that I wish the Bjorn had - like a bottle holder, various pockets for storing personal items, a shade so that harsh light doesn\'t bug baby when he\'s sleeping, waist and lumbar support, rings to attach toys and a clip to clip down the front when it\'s folded over.  The new on the hip design is great as you can wear baby on the hip or in front.  Perfect on the hip when feeding! He also gets a  better view when faced in of the outside world from my hip.  The Bjorn just did not seem to grow well with him, we tried adjusting it so many ways and it always seemed too tight and just not good for him even though it is a great design.  With the extras on the Snugli though it makes going out and about with the pack easier as you have everything handy without a diaper bag as well, this thing worked great for airport and international travel.  Never thought I would buy the cheap Snugli but I did!",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I love my Snugli.  When I would put her in it when she had colic(facing my chest) she would fall asleep.  Now I put her in it facing forward when I vacumn the house, do light housework, and when I go on shopping trips.  It takes the pressure off of my arms because she does not like to be in the stroller/carseat while I am shopping.",4
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"Our little one had reflux and anytime we put him in the carrier it was a royal mess.  There was just enough pressure on his little belly to turn it into a projectile mess.  I always felt like his little head was pressed to hard up against Mommy, or if folded down, it jabbed him in the chin.  Great theory, but my little man just wasn\'t comfortable.",2
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,I used this carrier for about 2 weeks and it was soooo uncomfortable.  I sold it on ebay.  I instead decided to spend the money for a Baby Bjorn and Im so glad I did.  I love the Baby Bjorn.,2
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,This product is a SUPER buy for the money.  I have 4 month old twins so it\'s perfect for carrying around one in the carrier and the other on the hip to go for a quick walk in the neighborhood.  It\'s easy to place the child in and take them out.  I highly recommend this product to all parents of infants.,5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I have a 4yr old, 3 yr old and 20 month old.  I purchased this when my second child was born so I could carry him and keep up with my 15 month old.  my second loved being held, so this helped tremendously, especially if we were going to be out with out a stroller.  and my older son loved it too!  When I had my third my oldest was only 2 1/2 so to keep my sanity we had to get out of the house, but I wasn\'t quite up to the task of an infant, toddler and one walking toddler,nor was I about to spend several hundred dollars on a thriple stroller to use for such a short period of time,  so I buckled the two older kids up and put my youngest in this (Which stayed in the basket when not in use).  This is absolutly the best investment I have ever made in any baby product (and I\'ve made quite a few :)) It\'s a great buy too $20!",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"The weight is accurate for the snugli. It was a saver for me on outings, simple to use,durable, & easier to use at the mall. Great gift-strongly recommend.",4
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",Comes in handy. My wife keeps a pack of these whenever we are leaving home just in case the kids have to use the bath room even at McDonald or any 3+ star hotel,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",We bought these before our family trip to Disney.  They worked pretty well.  I do wish they had more double sided tape to secure them to the toilet than just two.  It would be nice if there were four or more.  All in all this is a good product and I will buy them again.,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","These stick in place seats are a great concept, however they were hard to use in public bathrooms, etc.  It took way more time to get it on the seat versus the standard and then, disposal was an issue.  The tape was ultra sticky and was hard to remove at times.  Again - I love the concept or I wouldn\'t have purchased them.  I just think it needs to be tweeked a bit.  I\'ll still use them as they are much thicker and more ""cushy"" than the basic paper.",3
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","I carry this product wherever we go.  It makes it easier for my young children to use the public restrooms without worrying about their skin touching anything when they need to use the bathroom.  You no longer have to bother with lining the toilet with toilet paper.  Just peel off the little pink strips to reveal adhesive strips, lay this product down and it provides a non-slip protective oovering.  I keep a couple in my handbag for when I don\'t have the kids with me too.  A must-have product for anyone with children.  Plus, it\'s less expensive to buy it in bulk.  I find that by buying the 40 count product (which means you get 4 packages), it\'s like getting one free if you normally buy them separately at stores like Babies \'R Us or Target.",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","As a woman, these have been a lifesaver during camping trips and trips to foreign countries where public restrooms are very, let\'s say, disgusting. Just pop a few in your bag, and you\'re good to go.",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",Works Great for kids and adults. They can be used on the airplanes to just shopping in the local grocery store. I am a mother of 4. I can\'t leave home without them.,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","These toilet seat covers are lined on the underside with a waterproof cover, and, they stick in place.  So they don\'t slide off just as you are sitting down! :-))  I have a 4 year old granddaughter and we find the seat covers very useful for almost anywhere we go.  When traveling, we use one of these seat covers on the hotel toilets...you know what they say about the way hotel rooms are cleaned.",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",Got these at a much better price than I could have at Target and Babie\'s R us (pack of 10 for $5.99).  My daughter loves the Dora design and is more motivated to sit on the toilet.  They are much thicker and more sanitary than the usual publoic restroom toilet seat covers.,4
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","This is my second purchase of this particular product. We use the seat covers whenever my daughter needs to use a public restroom. They have two small removable tapes on the under side, to keep the cover in place, and they are of a sufficient size so the entire seat is amply covered. The covers are not biodegradable, so an adult will need to remove it from the seat and dispose of it in the garbage can when the child is done. I would recommend this product to anyone whose child is potty training or too young to manage hovering over the commode in public.",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",Great price and a great product.  These are much more expensive in discount and department stores.  We always reorder through Amazon.,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",What a wonderful way to help a toddler stay sanitary in a public restroom where they touch anything & everything while trying to go potty!!!,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",These potty toppers are wonderful!  They actually stay in place when I put my daughter or son on a public potty and cover the seat so their hands or bottoms don\'t touch the seat.  I\'ve used them too and they are much nicer and cover much better than those tissue paper disposable type.,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","There are other seat covers out there, but this one is superior.  The tape keeps them from falling in the toilet and they are waterproof, for icky situations.  Great for travel.  I even use them myself when we are in a restroom that doesn\'t supply the paper ones. Of course, we can\'t flush them.  I just put them in the sanitary napkin disposal bins.",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","These are thick seat covers with sticky spots to keep them in place.  However, they are advertised as  &#34;oversized dimensions cover the sides of the seat too, especially where your child holds on&#34; -- that is not correct.  They fit just like the tissue paper covers in public restrooms.  They are nice thick covers but if you are specifically looking for ones that will drape down over the seat edges and a little of the bowl, don\'t bother with these.",3
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","I\'m potty training my daughter and I hate the idea of her sitting on public toilets.  But when you\'re potty training, you\'ve got to do what you have to do.  I keep these in her bag, and whip them out when needed.  They fold flat, so they don\'t take up much space...very travel friendly.  They seem to fit most toilet seats, but I\'m happy as long as there is some sort of barrier.  These seat covers are even waterproof!",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",My 2 year old is moving up the potty training ladder and it helps to have these on hand when out in public. I like the fact that there are adhesives to prevent the topper from moving around.I think having a 10 pack is a good thing to help travel light.,4
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","Have you really considered how disgustingly dirty public restrooms are? Well I have, and I have always used these liners for my children over the course of 4 years. They hold up well, and compared to other brands that I tried, they are much better made and stick relatively well. Sometimes they stick a little too well, but I am ok with that considering the alternative (the liner falling into the potty for those who haven\'t used potty toppers before). I highly recommend these to everyone who has young children who can\'t yet stand or squat to go to the bathroom (and they are still great to have on hand for those emergency poopy breaks we have all had to take with our children at one time or another!) These are a must have!",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",These are great!! I don\'t have to worry as much when my daughter needs to use a public restroom anymore!,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","If your little one grabs onto the sides of the potty chair like mine does, then this seat cover DOES NOT offer enough protection.  Continue searching for the ones that actually drape over the sides of the seat.  They are worth the extra money!  I gave these Dora seat covers away to my friends who don\'t use any seat covers for their little ones, and they love them.  But for me (ultra cautious about public restrooms), they were not good enough.  They need to be designed to drape over the chair.",2
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","This is a wonderful product, so much better than the tissue covers a few restrooms offer or that are available at drugstores in the travel section.  I have 2 daughters (2 year and 5 years old) this is a must have item in our backpack!  The cost may seem steep for some and the environmentalist in me wants to say ""no"" to additional paper/plastic products, but by the time I get done toliet papering the seat or using enough tissue covers to make it comfortable for my girls I have wasted more than using just one of these seat covers.  Extra tip that we found when we were potty training our little ones, we also ripped the potty seat cover off the toliet seat when done and placed on the floor to stand on the face-up side while putting our pants or pull-ups back on, no yucky restroom floor in sock/bare feet!",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","This is a great idea but they don\'t stick to the toilet. As soon as I sit my daughter on the seat, the cover pulls off. It\'s easier (and cheaper) just to put toilet paper on the seat.",1
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",These helped my daughter use public restrooms.  I just wish they were in stores.  The little plastic adhesive strips  are a little hard to peel off but still an excellent product.,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","I have just returned from a 26 hour international journey with my 3 year old daughter. These disposable potty covers were great to use everywhere - on the plane, in airports, and other public toilets. The size is generous and the sides hang down on either side of the potty - makes it very hygenic as my daughter tends to hold on to the sides of the seat. The adhesive strips hold the covers firmly in place. Very happy with the product. I also used the primo folding potty seat on the plane and it worked great tooPRIMO Folding Potty with Handles White granite",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","This is a very helpful product - I am no longer afraid to take my child to a public restroom.  It\'s waterproof, thin and convenient to carry around.  It covers the whole seat with a little overhang for kids to hold onto.  However, when a toddler waits until the last minute to use the potty and you\'re rushing to unfold and remove the adhesives at the back, it\'s like the worst thing!  The removable adhesives are small and it\'s hard to find the part to pull.  I wish they would re-look at the design of this product - it could be an even better-selling product if the adhesives were larger and easier to remove.",3
Evenflo Snugli Citysport Carrier- Khaki,"My husband is 6\'5 and i am 5\'2. We originally meant to purchase the Baby Bjorn Carrier in XL but they didn\'t have it. We tried on all of the other carriers displayed in Babies R Us with our daughter. She is 5 mos old. She loved this one the best. This one was adjustable for my husbands size. Once you figure out how to wear it, it is quite easy to use. i just slip it on and only unbuckle the waste belt when i need to take it off. My daughter loves it and for the money it was the perfect choice.",5
Evenflo Snugli Citysport Carrier- Khaki,"After looking at the price of Baby Bjorn, we decided to purchase this carrier.  Our daughter loves it.  When she was 3 months old facing in, she always fell asleep and now facing forward, she seems very comfortable.  It adjusts well to fit both my husband and myself.  The only complaint I have is that because the straps don\'t cross in the back, it feels like it might fall off of your shoulders-but it never does.",4
Evenflo Snugli Citysport Carrier- Khaki,"I really love this carrier!  My son really enjoys being close to me or my husband, and this has become a life saver!  I use it at home to do chores, when exercising, going food shopping.... It\'s also very comfy to wear.  So, far its been one of the best purchases we\'ve made!",5
Evenflo Snugli Citysport Carrier- Khaki,"I actually bought this without reading any reviews ( i was on vacation ). BIG MISTAKE! My baby girl is only 2 1/2 months and 11 lbs., but yet she just fit in the carrier. We tried her in it twice, both times she was calm and happy. After securing her in it,( which needs 2 poeple to be safe with a squirming baby) she quickly became agitated. There wasn\'t adaquite head support with her facing in, even with her being able to have head control herself. Also, the straps that come off the shoulders are very badly designed becaucse the baby\'s face can rub into them and they aren\'t padded. Also, the 2 clips on either side of the body piece are akward and not adjustable, so when your baby gets any sorf of a belly then they no longer can fit in either direction. And lastly, after the 3-5 minutes that my daughter was in this, when we took her out her legs had large indents from the material and the portion of her leg that was dangling was starting to get very red (i assume from circulation being restricted from the product). I have already brought this back to the store and haven\'t purchased a replacement. I recommend trying with your child in the stores display before concidering.",1
Evenflo 2-in-1 Laxford Walnut SmartSteps Swing- 4088527A,"I have had this swing for seven years and absolutely love it.  I bought it at a close out store seven years ago and have never had a problem I don\'t know how many babies have been in it since then, (my husband and I were foster parents and had a lot of babies in our care).  I love the controls for the different speeds, and all of my babies have liked the toy in the tray.  I have to change the batteries about once a month, but that is with daily use.  I would definitely recommend this swing.",5
Chicco Travel Seat Explorer,"We were having our ""second"" child, and had NO CLUE of what kind of chair to get since our daughters chair was HORRIBLE!.Well, it turns out we were expecting twins (funny, many ""owners"" have twins) and we knew that we couldn\'t be cleaning two highchairs daily, especially since the one chair we had for our daughter was hard enough!The wonderful features!*  A removable cloth seat. Its also dark which has proven useful for hiding stains*  A 3 point harness, or as some call it, a lap belt. This belt is attached to removable seat, not to the metal frame*  Two hippos that clamp to the top of your table. They are rubber, so they protect tables from scratches, keep the chair in place, and are pretty adorable. They also make it safe for small fingers! With other chairs our boys were able to reach underneath the grips and pinch their hands! OUCH!*  The chair folds into a carrying bag. This has proven convenient on many occasions, and we found it pretty easy to fold.*  Its lightweight, and fits nearly EVERY table!*  It can hold up to 37 lbs, that\'s A LOT of child for a small chair!Our opinions*  The chair is so easy to clean. We are able to wipe it with a damp rag after meal time, and it dries in seconds. Its also machine washable, and drier safe! There\'s also NO nooks or crannies. No matter WHAT reviews say about highchairs, there ARE nooks and crannies in ALL of them!*  The cover is hard to take off, but that\'s a good thing considering you wouldnt want it to be too easy to remove!*  The chairs really do attach well to any table, and they are easy to remove and place on securely. For the people saying that you cannot eat at a table with one leg in the center, we found this untrue. We were able to either (1) Place the boys opposite of one another, to balance out the table (or if you only have one child, place something heavy on the other end!) (2) place a chair, with a booster seat (given out by the restaurants) under the seats to hold them up, or (3) request a booth and place them inside the booth, which also supports them well.*  Folding isn\'t something I would want to do after every meal, but its not as hard, for us, as everyone else describes it. It may take 3-5 minutes to fold a chair, but its certainly do-able! And once folded they are very flat, and very easy to travel with!*  The seat is quite spacious, but this is a good thing! A child around the age of 2.5 could probably still sit in the hippos, my daughter is 3 and can fit, but won\'t sit in a ""baby chair"", that\'s why I say 2.5! I also love that even though the seat area is large, our 13th percentile twins are able to feel secure!*  The harness is easy to adjust, and I feel keeps them from sliding out! There\'s nothing for them to use to push out of the seat, and there\'s really no way a baby/toddler could do this in under 3 minutes, which I feel is a long time to leave your child alone!*  There is no tray. This is very annoying, but we find that the suction cup mats are good enough to protect our tables. And the large gap between baby and the table is also fine. We keep those large/long plastic bibs with the pockets on the boys, so they dont really get messy. Wiping up a mat, and the floor is a lot more negotiable than dissembling a highchair for deep cleaning!*  I would DEFIANTLY say do not use the hippos until your baby can sit up properly, which for our boys was around 5.5 months old.*  The travel bags have proven to be excellent! We have managed to fit both chairs into one bag, which makes hauling them around that much easier! If you only have one, than this assures you that you wont need a diaper bag while going out to a restaurant! I also love that they included it, even if it ""didn\'t work"".All in all the hippos are fantastic chairs. The boys, now 7 months, are eating at the table with us, and enjoying meal time. We also spend more time with the kids, than scrubbing and cursing over highchairs... A highly recommended product",5
Chicco Travel Seat Explorer,I bought this as a gift for my niece and my sister loves using it with her. It seems like it\'s put together well and had nice little features for safety and comfortability. I\'d say it\'s worth the money spent.,4
Chicco Travel Seat Explorer,"This chair makes things really easy when you are on the go.  We used it for our travels to grandparents houses and it was perfect.  Fit on all the tables that we used and it was nice having my son right up at the table with us.  One warning is the chair is a bit heavy to travel with wish it was a tad bit lighter, and a little difficult to get off to wash. But once you have mastered taking off the cover it is easy.  I even use it at home sometimes too.  Definitely worth the purchase.  Glad we got it.",4
Chicco Travel Seat Explorer,Our household is very centered around the family and the highchair that we had for our son just didn\'t allow us to be that at the table. This is the perfect chair for the family that want to eat together. It allows him to sit with us and enjoy family time instead of being two or more feet away.I have had so many people over for dinner now purchasing these chairs. My only regret is not getting it sooner.,5
Chicco Travel Seat Explorer,"This product is amazing! I have 3 children and I wish I had it for my first child instead of my last.  I would recommend it to any new parent to use it instead of a conventional high chair. The child sits at the table with everyone else. This makes them really feel like part of the family. No more tripping over the base of the high chair. Very compact, easy to clean, portable if  you want to travel with it. Like I said a must have!",5
Fisher Price Laugh &amp; Learn Keys,"The keys are pretty big and heavy.  Not what I expected.  You can remove them from the ""keychain"" but it\'s still a pretty bulky item, especially for a 10 month old.  I love the Laugh and Learning series, but this one was a dud.",2

Fisher Price Laugh &amp; Learn Keys,"When my son was 8 months old I bought this toy. He loves keys.Unfortunately it just falls off the ring, keys and little sounds thingy. Its a wonderful toy but falls apart easily, and becomes a pain in the butt.",3
Fisher Price Laugh &amp; Learn Keys,This toy is too clunky and hit my 6 mos old in the head when she was playing with it and she cried.  It\'s hard to clean too as I shorted out the music by accidentally getting too much water into it.,1

Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"As other parents have mentioned - this toy is simply too loud.  I was so excited when I bought this for my daughter\'s first birthday it is just so cute and the concept/design is great.  However, when I put the batteries in and turned it on my daughter was actually scaried of the loud noise it makes when the balls spin.  My daughter is not one to scare easily, but it is very loud.  I actually thought the music wasn\'t working.  This one will be great once it gets a simple redesign.",4
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"If you or your baby are sensitive to noise, don\'t get this toy!  When the balls are on the turntables, you can\'t even hear the music.  It was so loud that it scared my 8 month old!  Aside from the noise, it\'s very boring.  My baby was bored after a couple of minutes.  I usually like Fisher Price toys, but don\'t waste you money on this one!  Try the ""Laugh and Learn"" learning table or the gym wall...both have lots of activities and have proven safe so far!",1
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"all the negative stuff said about this toy are true.  It is loud.  The music is drowned out, and the spinning mechanishm breaks down easily.  BUT....my daughter still loves watching the balls spin round and round....she thinks the toy is great.  she also enjoys pushing the button without the balls actually on the spinner, so she can hear the music. I wouldn\'t necesarily highly recomend the toy, but i dont think your child will be diapointed if you pick it up.",3
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"Santa brought this toy to our daughter.  Immediately, we were completely turned off by how noisy the toy became when you added the balls.  The roll a rounds drop hard and loudly onto the platforms and then clank so loudly that you can barely hear the music in the background.  The balls do not need to drop this hard to activate the music, as simply rolling over the buttons works.  It is a very poor design.  We are very disappointed with this product.  Our daughter does enjoy pushing the big red button.",2
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"I never wrote a review before - but think that this toy deserves it. This was one of the first toys that I bought for my son because I thought that it might help with his tummy time.  And, at a few months old, he loved watching the balls roll around. It is loud - but it never scared him.  He is 8 months now and still plays with this toy every day.  He loves to watch the balls, to try to catch the balls, to slide the butterflies up and down, and open and close the door with the monkeys behind it.  We have even found that Weebles work well with it.  The best part is that he hasn\'t destroyed it (he is a tough little customer) and it keeps taking a beating.  I love that his fingers don\'t get caught in the disks - because he loves stopping them with the palms of his hands when trying to catch the balls.  And, it is very stable and won\'t tip over. It looks like such a simply toy - but it has grown with my son and he loves it.  I can see him continuing to love it because the treehouse will be a great imaginative place for all of his play figures in the future.",5
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 7 months old.  When he was nine months, he got his arm stuck in the hole on the treehouse.  (His arm went in the hole at the top of the treehouse and came out the hole just to the left of the treehouse.)  Fortunately, I was right there when it happened and was able to get his arm out before he was injured trying to get his arm out himself. I returned the toy to Fisher-Price and told them about my experience.  If you decide to purchase this product (I wouldn\'t), be very careful.",1
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"I bought this toy for my 12 month old and she had fun with it for a week or so. The balls it comes with are loud, but that\'s what catches their attention. We also spun other balls and toys such as little people on the spinners. She lost interest in it for a few weeks and one day she used the toy as a ladder to get onto the couch. She would stand on the spinners and then the treetop. I caught her doing this about 3 times and now the spinners dont spin at all(not a battery problem). She\'s very petite and only weighs 18 lbs., So I was very surprised that she could do any damage to a fisher price toy. Even though I threw out the box, I\'m returning this toy to Toys r Us. Since it is broken, I will be exchanging it for a completely different toy. Anyone can do this. I know because I worked there, in customer service, for 2.5 years. If they give you  any problems, just ask to see the manager. Dont waste your money people.",2
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,My daughter will crawl to this toy no matter where it is in the room as long as she knows it\'s there. It does make a lot of noise if the balls are being used but my daughter usually likes it without the balls. Her favorite part is stopping the spinning wheels with her hands. I like that there\'s a red button to activate the toy without having to put a ball in the hole at the top since at 9 months she\'s hasn\'t learned to do that yet. I do worry about her trying to use it for balance now that she\'s standing up. I wouldn\'t recommend leaving this toy with a child trying to stand or walk.,5
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"I agree with a past review that this toy is too loud.  You can\'t even hear the music when the balls are bouncing around.  But that is not my problem.  The hole that you drop the balls in on the top of the treehouse is not on the top as it appears in all pictures on the web site, on this website, on the box, even in the instructions inside.  The hole to put the balls in is in the front of the tree.  It requires a completely different skill set to use this.  It is not a 6 month toy.  I called to complain and was treated terribly and told ""we know about it.  There is a disclaimer ont he box that contents can differ from picture.""  THAT WAS THEIR ANSWER TO ME!!!  I thought that was pretty crappy.  My 13 month old son cannot even figure out how to get the balls in that hole.What poor poor cusomter service.  I even talked to a manager and got that same poor and rude service.",1

I don\'t really recommend this toy.  However, my son did seem to like the balls that came with it.",2
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"in concept this is an adorable toy, but i have a few big issues with it:1. SO loud & noisy! the racket the plastic balls make when they roll around!!! you have to strain to enough hear the animal sounds & music2. although my 6 month & 2 yr old like it (noisy & newest toy in the house), it is honestly incredibly BORING! pretty much the entire entertainment value is putting the balls thru the tree, etc & when they hit the base it spins...that is it! i like toys that ""do"" something, or entertain..meaning a great improvement on this toy would be to have extra sounds ~ a creak when when you open the tree door, monkeys chattering when you see the monkeys behind the door, water gurgling/bubbles when the ball hits the waterfall....but nothing!i really wish i would have waited for FP to redesign/revamp this toy before i rushed out & got it. not much to it & most certainly not worth the money!!",2
Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,"I got this for my son for his 1st Christmas, and it was the best $20 I spent.  This thing has lasted for EVER...he has pounded on it, stopped the wheels with his hands and feet, sat on it, stood on it, turned it upside down and fallen on it...it still hasn\'t kicked it...I keep waiting on the motor to give it up, but the thing just keeps taking the abuse.  My son was 5 months when we gave it to him, and it was an incentive to sit up and play, as well as a fun way for him to learn hand/eye coordination by dropping the balls in the primary tree house hole.  When he tired of just doing that he learned to push the button, step on the button and bang the button with other toys.  Now he\'s working on sliding things in at the triggers on the ball paths from the back of the toy...It\'s not MY personal favorite, but we\'re on our second set of batteries in a world where he loses interest before one set wears out...I\'m happy with my 7 months of enjoyment for 20 bucks. I love him try and fit NEW things through that hole (his shoe the other day), and he doesn\'t mind the noise and music, so I try not too...",4

Now my baby seems to like it. however, the noise of playing with balls on this jungle toy is sort of bad, I think.",3
I Play Big Sister/ Little Brother 2-pc. Set - Yellow,We used these for the birth announcement for our son.  It was so cute.  The only thing I had to complain about is the sizes weren\'t listed when I ordered.  But fortunately the t shirt and the onesie fit.,4

We washed it a couple of times already, and it seems to be holding up well.  My only complaint was that the product description did not say what size the onesie and the shirt are.  Luckily, when they arrived in the mail, we were able to tell that they would fit once we opened the package.  I think the toddler shirt fits a 2T or a 3T.  It\'s a little big on our daughter, and she wears a 24 month or 2T size.  The onesie is big on our newborn (who was born at almost 9 pounds), but not horribly so.  It\'s probably a 0-3 month size.

Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,eh.  These particular adjusters didn\'t make a  noticeable change to the belt position so I wouldn\'t buy these again.,2
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,Difficult to use - becareful when placing on seatbelt- if  not correct it is very difficult to open. When in proper position it pokes sister in the hip and she is unhappy with it,2
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,Product assembles easy however where it sits on the hip area near the buckle it presses on your leg. Feels awkward.,3
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"The Heininger Automotive Seat Belt Strap Adjuster is a great idea. When I saw it on Amazon, I was really hopeful it would solve a problem I\'ve had with seat belts for years -which is the strap riding up across my neck. It\'s uncomfortable and annoying, and probably not safe in an accident. I was hopeful the Strap Adjuster would help get the strap to lie comfortably over my shoulder instead of on my neck.The seat belt in the car I drive now is a three-point reel-type seat belt - or lap and sash belt. It\'s one continuous length of webbing, which slides through a retractor mechanism - this is where the belt divides into the lap belt and shoulder strap. I can also adjust the upper part of the strap behind my shoulder by way of a mechanism that moves up and down - depending on the height of the driver. You\'d think with the ability to make adjustments in all of those places I could get the darned thing to stay where it should be - across my shoulder. Also, this car\'s seat belt came equipped with it\'s own seat belt adjuster almost identical to the Heininger Seat Belt Adjuster. Unfortunately, the belt in my car has always ended up on my neck. LOL Do many others have this much trouble? I assume the Heininger Strap Adjuster will work well for some if not most people, with one caveat - it does slide out of adjustment.My main concern is, of course, safety. It does  tighten and lock when I come to an abrupt stop, so as long as I\'m adjusting it as it slides it\'s okay. I did drop one star because of the sliding issue, but 4 stars is still a great score, and I think the product is good. I\'d recommend it if someone else had a similar problem.The strap adjuster does keep the strap off of my neck when it\'s adjusted. Maybe part of it is my height &/or shape. I\'m 5\'7 and a normal weight, but I\'m curvy on top - and that\'s where it tends to slide. It\'s possible when manufacturers are making products they base them on an average height and weight man. I\'ve read that other things are made that way, and they have to go by some standard, so I guess they\'d use the standard of whoever their target market is.I\'ve put a lot of thought into this because this has been an issue with, not only this car, but other cars as well. My husband is 6\'2 and he doesn\'t ever seem to have this problem.  So, over the years I\'ve tried various things to try to keep the strap off of my neck - large paper clips, hair clips, rubber bands, pins, etc... I\'ve never seen another product like the Commutemate, so it follows that I\'ve never found another add-on product that does a better job than Commutemate. It is unique.Four stars for the idea and product itself. One stars off because it tends to slide little by little as I drive",4

Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"when i put the first one on, i was watching what i was doing very carefully, and it took me a minute to install.  the second one, i was over confident and didn\'t have it threaded correctly before i clipped it together.  you really can\'t un-clip this without breaking it.  For the price though, i wasn\'t all that upset, I already had a second set on order for our 2nd car.  I love how these clips don\'t heat up as they are plastic, don\'t interfere other people who aren\'t using the clip with seat belt usage, and can adjust for anyone to use the seat belt.  I no longer and constantly pulling the seat belt off my neck.",4
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"It\'s inexpensive and does work, but it does take regular adjustment. It may have been fine when you undid the seat belt on your last drive, but may need to be adjusted again when you put the seat belt on next time.",4
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,I\'m an overweight person and get tired of seat belts rubbing my neck.  This little device is great to help you adjust the seat belt to fit better.  It just takes a snap to install and you can easily slide it to where it fits the best for you.,5

Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"If you are short like me, you know about the seat belt cutting across you neck.  It is so irritating and you are constantly pulling the belt away from your neck trying to get it to stay somewhere (anywhere) else.  This little thing is not perfect but it is a major improvement.  It makes it to where the belt can come up from the middle of your torso instead of the side or you can adjust the clip to wherever you like along the bottom belt.",5
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"The clip snaps together and is easy to install, making it possible to adjust the position of the shoulder strap so it does not rub against your neck and crosses your chest more comfortably. On the downside, the tension pulls the lap belt up and presses the hard plastic clip into my tummy. For me it just trades one discomfort for another, so I don\'t bother with it. For a few bucks, it\'s worth a try if you are experiencing discomfort from the shoulder strap.",3
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"If you are careful... you might be able to make your trip without it coming apart...but don\'t count on it.  It is poorly designed and Pops off the seat belt too easily.  I put some super glue on it, so it holds now.  But I shouldn\'t have to do that.  So...a little patience and super glue..and it works",2
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"They slip and slide and won\'t stay in place. After putting them on per the instructions, I found that they wouldn\'t hold in place. Every time the seat belt was used, they would slide around, pop out, or had to be readjusted. Don\'t waste your money on these novelty items. Cheap plastic; worthless product.",1
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"I bought a pair of these about 10 years ago at the car wash. They work great, especially if you are short because the strap always seems to cut across my neck; even after adjusting the belt holder to it\'s lowest position. When I traded that car in, I made sure the car salesman took them out of the old car and installed them on the belts of the new car. Still using the same original set for 11 years. Now, I purchased another set to put into our 2nd car. Wouldn\'t be without them, they are that good.",5
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"My reaction to this seat belt adjuster is mixed. Does it keep the shoulder belt from rubbing my neck? Yes. And extra points for being easy to install. What I don\'t like so much is that sometimes the adjuster flips a bit upward and digs into my midsection, so really the discomfort has just moved from my neck to my stomach. I find that if I pull the lap belt snug (not uncomfortably snug, by any means) then the adjuster doesn\'t bother me. I also think it\'s kind of a pain that you have to re-set the adjuster every time you put the seat belt on. To sum it up, I\'m more comfortable with this adjuster than without it now that I know how to set it, but I think there is room for improvement.",3
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"The HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER is exactly what I have been looking for!  I am short and (to use my 5 year old\'s word) have a large bosom.  Even with the sliding seatbelt adjustment now available on most cars, the shoulder belt has always hit me in the neck instead of across the collarbone and shoulder.  Not only is this uncomfortable, - it results in rubbing and chaffing on my neck - it is also dangerous and could cause potentially fatal injury during a crash, if the seat belt were to tighten and lock across my neck.However, the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER is a brilliant little solution to that particular problem.  It is made of heavy duty plastic, small, and fairly easy to use.  First, you clip the bracket on to the lap belt. This bracket is very sturdy and quite secure.  I know because I clipped it together before putting it on the seat belt, just to see how it worked.  It took my husband applying a whole lot of force with a pocket knife to get it unclipped again!  Next, you hook the shoulder strap into the bracket tongue (which should be facing down).  Finally, you slide the bracket into a comfortable position. As you do, the bracket pulls the lap and shoulder belts together across your hips, pulling the shoulder belt away from your neck and across your shoulder.  Exactly what I wanted!There are a couple of tricks, however, to using the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER.  If you read the instructions, the bracket should be NO MORE THAN THREE INCHES AWAY from the seat belt buckle.  Sliding it further than that causes that lap belt to ride up and the bracket to dig into your belly.  This you do not want.  Also, if you cinch your lap belt tightly across your hips before adjusting the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER, the lap belt will be more likely to stay on your hips, rather than your belly.  Then, if you do what the picture on the packaging shows, and fold the shoulder strap back on itself, the shoulder strap will lie flat and tight across your shoulder and stay away from your neck.I really like the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER.  It does everything I want and comes two to a package, so you can put one in each car.  But it gets only 4 stars because of the quirky tricks needed to make it work right and for the poorly written, incomplete directions.",4
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,These are great.  I am short and the seatbelt cuts across my neck. These reposition the seatbelt to across your chest.  They are plastic and if you have an accident (and I have) they pop open.  I love them and have them in both cars in our family,5
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"When I am in our F-150 pickup, the seatbelt rides just under my chin and along the side of my face.  This is uncomfortable and immensely annoying, and I also have this image of immediate decapitation should there be an accident.  I am 5\'6"" and the ""adjustable"" seat belt hanger sits at its lowest point on the chassis, so I don\'t see why this should be the case, but there it is.So I thought this little gadget to adjust the belt would be just the thing.  I was wrong.One positive is that the manufacturer does not use the ""impervious to all implements"" hard plastic packaging, just a plastic bubble with cardboard backing.  There are two adjusters in the package, although that isn\'t immediately clear, either from the packaging or the instructions.  The instructions are the first problem... they are all text, with no pictures.  Pictures would make this so much easier!As near as I could figure out, you get two pieces per adjuster -- a sort of ""bracket"" that fits on the front of the lap belt and a little ""keeper"" that goes behind.  The keeper is a thin plastic bar with little tabs at top and bottom that click into the bracket, so that the belt is sandwiched between.  One really silly thing is that the tabs aren\'t symmetrical, so you have to figure out which is top and which is bottom to click the keeper bar into place.The bracket has a clip that sticks out, a lot like the tabby-thing you\'d use to clip your cell phone to your belt, for example.  You put the bracket on the lap belt so the opening is facing down and then you can slide it back and forth on the lap belt.  Then you slip the shoulder strap under the clip and it now ""attaches"" wherever you want on the lap belt, rather than at the point where the belt clips into the seat.However, it turns out that the lap belt just twists under the pressure of the shoulder belt, so the shoulder belt is now not just in your face, but in your face sideways.  The free sliding means that the pressure also will eventually pull the adjuster back to the point where the seat belt *wants* to attach, at the seat.  Even if it is in place and untwisted, the belt is now coming at an odd angle to the chassis attachment, which encourages the twisting to re-occur.Initially, I had a lot of trouble getting the device to ""clamp"" to the belt, and it would pop off while I was driving.  Now, however, I can\'t get the silly thing off!Lastly, I have to rethink my initial goal... by running the shoulder belt along the lap belt for a space, you introduce slack into the belt... slack that will have to play out before you are actually restrained in an accident.  And that seems like rather a bad idea.I\'m going back to a hot but at least unchafing ultrasuede wrap-around to shield my neck from the belts.",1

Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"I\'m one of those people who is always aggravated by seat belts, whether my own or being in someone else\'s vehicle. I usually use a quilted wrap to keep from rubbing my skin near my neck, but it shifts or the closure ends up irritating my skin.Heininger\'s Automotive CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster has given me the near perfect relief. It took me two tries to get it attached correctly. The first time I put it in backwards. While it still worked fine, it caused my belts to twist and tangle incorrectly. I had to remove the clamp which was a real pest to detach. Once so, I flipped it around and got it attached correctly.Once in place, I was very happy with relief it provided. My seat belt no longer rides high on my collarbone. Nice! Using it the next time I climbed in the car showed how effortless it is to reclip the seat belt and keep the belt off my collarbone. Only then, at first, I didn\'t like how I can feel the plastic adjuster against my hips. I quickly forgot about as I started to drive.One thing I noticed the second time around is that you can\'t keep the strap adjuster more than just a few inches away from the buckle, otherwise the seat belt straps where they\'re clipped at begin to ride high and lay against your midsection rather than low at your hips. The instructions do state not to use the adjuster more than just a few scant inches away from the seat belt buckle - now I know why. The seat belts will raise up and away from your lap if you do.Pros:- Provides the relief needed from seat belts riding high.- Easy to install (once you figure out the short installation instructions).- You get two of them.Cons:- Rides high if the adjuster slides too far away from the buckle.- The bulkiness of the belt can be felt and may be a tad uncomfortable for some people.Overall, I\'m happy with Heininger Commutemate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster. It\'s given me the relief I needed to drive comfortably, especially with longer distances.",4

KidCo LifeStyle Stroller - Champagne Mist,"I absolutely love this stroller.  I have 7 strollers (I have a stroller fetish :)  and this one stays in my trunk at all times.  All though we ordered it when I was pregnant with my daughter thinking it would be the car stroller.  I ended up using it as soon as we got it with my then 5yr old during our trip to Cananda.  We went to the amusement park everyday and dragged this along with us so my 5 yrs old could take a nap.  Which worked out perfectly even with his size this pushed like a dream.  My sister-in-law who is a faithul PegPerego user even loved this.  On 2 occasions my neice even napped in it LOL.  For a compact stroller this has all the features that a mom & dad needs, the greatest feature was the height adjustment cushioned handles.  After using it for about 3 months with our little girl I realized that it accomodated my Graco Snug Ride which made this even more of a pleaser.  Its rare to find a compact stroller that holds the infant car seat.  I highly recommend this stroller.  Since I babysit another baby I am even looking into buying a twin version of this stroller.  I was a little skeptical when I first bought it since I never heard of the name, but I am hooked :)",5
JJ Cole Essentials Diaper Bag Sky/Lemon,"This has been the perfect diaper bag - so easy to wear and compartments for everything.  It looks compact, but is pretty roomy.  I have a 3 year old and 18 month old and carry my cell phone, wallet, plenty of snacks, sippy cup, 2 diaper and wipes everywhere we go.  I haven\'t missed all the excess stuff I used to carry in my uncomfortable previous diaper bags.  Love it.",5
JJ Cole Essentials Diaper Bag Sky/Lemon,"(2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can\'t overfill that... there\'s just room for one bottle, isn\'t that what it is made for???My husband really loved this bag because it wasn\'t \'girly or babyish\' but put the $$ on something that will hold a bottle!",2
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag,"The third time I wore it, as I tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand (other arm is carrying my 14-month-old), the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke, and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable. I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction.",1
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag,"I love the concept of this bag and based on other reviews I went ahead and ordered it.  I have a 17 month-old and we aren\'t carrying as much stuff with us anymore so I thought it would be perfect.  I gave the bag 3 stars because for its size it has a wonderful amount of storage space and it looks great!  Another reviewer mentioned something to the effect of how you didn\'t have to worry about smacking your toddler in the face with this diaper bag, which agreeably is a WONDERFUL feature as that is one of my peeves.  (Managing purse & diaper bag on shoulder while picking up baby.)  However, and maybe I was doing something wrong, but, everytime I bent over with this bag fully packed, the weight of it would swing it down under my right arm so it was still a problem trying to manage it and pick up my toddler.  And this was with the adjustment strap fully tightened.  I am 5\'3"", so maybe a taller user could get it tighter than I was able to.  Also, the bottle bag that comes with it is truly that,a BOTTLE bag.  It would not hold any of the sippy cups I have, and I have many different types from the cheap to not so cheap.  I ended up returning it, although I think this would be a nice bag for airline travel, just not an every day bag for us.  Hope this helps someone!  :o)",3
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag,"I bought this bag as a ""quick trip"" bag for my one month and 2.5 year old girls.  I got it specifically for the purpose of making a quick trip to the grocery store, doctors office, or a quick lunch out with the girls.  I don\'t want to carry my gargantuan full size bag everywhere.  It suits this purpose very well - and then some.I can fit a capped bottle pre-filled with water in the bottle carrier, plus extra drop-ins and nipples. (I use the Playtex drop-in bottles so if I need more than one bottle out, I just pack extra nips and liners)  In the top portion, I can fit a full pack of travel wipes (Huggies or pampers on the go sets), 3 small diapers (sz 1) and 2-3 larger diapers (sz 4)  I can also usually slide my wallet in this section.In the middle compartment, I have a onsie and pants and a receiving blanket, and several small toys for my toddler (some plastic dinosaurs, tiny cars, and 2 small playdoh packs and a plastic knife for cutting them up)In the bottom section, I have a container for powdered formula and a scoop, a disposable diaper bag container, and usually a bagged snack for the toddler (goldfish or cheerios)On the front I carry my keys in the top pocket, and sanitizer and spare socks in the longer compartment.  In the bottom, I carry a pack of gum and a pen.This bag works great for us, its easy to get on and off, easy to clean, and holds quite a bit.  We\'ve had it in use for a month, and I love it!  Plus - my husband doesn\'t mind carrying it, which is always a bonus.  I\'ve seen some reviews that say the lining tears between compartments.  So far I\'ve seen no seams ripping, and we use it almost every day.  We\'re pretty hard on bags - ie: I even wore it comfortably on amusement park style rides at the state fair with my 2yo.  I hope not to see any issues on this, but at this cost - its well worth replacing if it does.",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag,"I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far.  I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time.  It seem quite rugged, and holds a ton! I can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers, a travel wipes container, a small changing pad, a couple of spare onsies, a nursing shawl, 2 washcloths for spit up, an extra receiving blanket, a 4 oz bottle of cleanser, phone, lipstick, keys and wallet, and that is only in the main compartments.  The only proplem I\'ve had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag, but I was able to fix it.  I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along, but for now, this is perfect!",5
The Essentials Bag - Khaki &amp; Pink,I loved the size of the bag and that its hands free but it doesn\'t stay closed. The velcro isn\'t very strong and as soon as I would bend over everything would fall out! I would recommend the product if the flap would stay secure.,3
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,"Love this bag and so does my girlfriend who wanted to steal mine at first.  It fits most of the essentials to go out for the day to the mall or to run errands.  It even fits my wideneck bottles and wallet.  There is not enough room for change of clothes, changing pad, or toys but that\'s what the bottom of the stroller is for.  It is very comfortable to wear even over a jacket and does not hurt your back to carry it.  And it\'s never in the way of maneuvering your way through the aisles.",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,"I have had the pretty Petuina Pickle Bottom bag, the baby Bjorn diaper bag, and the baby sherpa bag and I have to say none of them functioned for me.  For other moms I am sure those bags worked great for them but this tiny compact bag is the greatest. I wish I had this bag when my son was first born.  Although it looks small it holds everything! And it gives you a chance to have your hands free without even feeling like you are wearing a bag.  I am in love with this bag.  It is so nice to go out and not feel like I am moving in.  With my other bags they were so big and bulky and with this one it is like I don\'t even have it.  Again it is a must have for all moms!!!!  If you get the Black and Gray it is great for the dad\'s as well.",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,"I\'ve had the Essentials bag for about a week now, and I absolutely love it!  I had a small size Eddie Bauer diaper bag, and it would constantly slip off my shoulder when I was carrying the infant carrier, which made things more difficult. Not only is this bag stylish, its functional as well.  My baby is almost 6 weeks old, and I can still carry all the major necessities that fit in my other diaper bag.  If you get the black & gray model, Dad can use it also!This is what I currently carry in the bag:Bottle Holder - 1 4 oz. Dr. Brown bottle, can definitely fit larger bottles in the futureLarge Top Compartment - 3 diapers, baby wipes case, and small bottles of hand sanitizer and baby powder, disposable changing padMiddle Compartment - 2 4 oz. Dr. Browns bottles and a formula dispenserBottom Compartment - Extra Sleeper and Shirt, my wallet, and keysSmall Velcro Compartment on Strap - loose coinsCell Phone Compartment - my cell phone of courseSmall Zipper Compartment - Chapstick and Lipstick - there is also a nifty pen holder next to this compartment",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,"I absolutely love this bag. It is perfect for when you are out for a few hours. It holds everything you need for a diaper change and more. I also like that it is not big and bulky like a lot of other bags. Plus, it looks cool and my husband doesn\'t mind carrying it either.",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,"This bag is great! We do alot of traveling on the airlines with our 8 month old and this is perfect. We can fit what our son needs as well as my bilfold, cell phone, keys and a lipstick and pen for myself! I usually pack 6 diapers, travel wipes, couple jars baby food, bib, burp rag, extra outfit, 1~8oz & 1~4oz bottle as well as a few toys. It is worth every penny!!!! Oh yes, and my 12 year old sons gameboy!",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,"I ordered the essentials bag after struggling with a bulky regular diaper bag and my newborn.  The essentials bag fits a blanket for laying the baby on to change, a new outfit, at least two diapers, a wipes case, three 6 oz. bottles, a formula dispenser, my wallet, keys, pacifer, burp cloth, and cell phone.  Everything has it ones compartment, which makes finding everything easy, no digging around in the middle of a big bag, and due to the design it feels much lighter than a larger bag.  I have not had issues with the seams coming apart either.  I also recommend the Bundle Me, by JJ Cole, it makes winter travel with babies so much easier than a snow suit!",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,"This bag is great for everyday use!  I find it very convenient and much more comfortable than lugging around a bulky diaper bag!  I carry this bag and there is no need to carry my purse because I can put my cc, i.d., lipstick, etc. all in the bag with my daughters essentials!  Everywhere I go people comment on this bag and how they are going to buy one for their daughter!!  Great Bag!",5
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,We originally ordered this bag so that my husband wouldn\'t feel like he was using a purse for a diaper bag.  I fell in love with it too. It is hands free and there is a place for my wallet and cell phone.  This bag is perfect for short trips or a meal out.  All the separate compartments really keep you organized.  The only problem we had was the stitching on the outer flap of the diaper compartment was too close to the edge and the material starting fraying and essentially falling apart.  I loved the bag so much that I thought I would give it another try and have not had any problems with the new one.  I am hoping that it was just a fluke.  I prefer this bag over my other 2 diaper bags HANDS DOWN.,4
Tigger High Back Chair,"My son recv\'d this as a Christmas gift from his grandparents. At first I thought it was a little junky (and it does look junky with the blue fake fur), but my son loves it! He\'s three and it\'s just the right size for him. He watches all of his favorite movies in his special little chair.I have a 20 pound cat named King Mo who spends his spare time in the chair when my son isn\'t using it. Apprently, he\'s holding court what with Tigger on the chair and all. It\'s quite funny to walk into the living room and see a mountain of housecat sprawled out in the seat and over the arm of this little toddler chair!The cover is removable and washable. It zippers on and off. Be sure to air dry this one, though, or you\'ll have blue fur in your dryer for weeks.This chair also makes a nice footstool to prop up your feet under the computer desk. ;)",5
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"I bought this stroller in March of 05, six months ago. Within a couple of months of light to average use, one footrest strap had snapped. I called Kolcraft in July and was told I would receive a replacement part with instructions. I received nothing.Now the other footrest strap has also broken. This means my kids\' feet are either dragging on the ground or kicking the wheels--lots of fun to push. So I called again last week and was told that the original order was never entered into the ""system."" Whatever. They placed another order for me and asked me to email pictures of the damage, which I did.I received the replacement straps yesterday, with no installation instructions. I emailed them and got a quick response with instructions: drill out the rivets, buy a screw and locking washer and screw them on. Except I need to buy a special rivet drill bit. And then I get to have a screw sticking out waiting to impale my kids\' legs? Unacceptable.I emailed Kolcraft again and was basically told that it was my problem. Not in so many words, but that\'s the end result. This stroller is still under warranty, but they won\'t honor it.The sun canopies are also substandard. They\'re too small to block any sun and prevent the stroller from folding properly when attached.I would not recommend this stroller to anyone!",1
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"I tried several different double strollers but this particular one and specially for its price worked great for my 2.5 years  and 13 months old kids. Yes..it doesnt have it all but I would still recommend it. There is no storage basket but if you hang your diaper bag and other small bags on the handles.. it takes its weight perfectly. The canopy, I would agree with other reviewers, is a piece of crap. But better something than nothing. It folds compactly. Just perfect for the airport and rail stations. Breaks works very well. Reclines well too and both seats are independent of each other. I wont say its all terrain but it can still steer okie on rough roads and hilly areas. Its light-weight and folds and opens easily and can fit into any car\'s trunk. Dont need a van or Suv to carry it.I would reccomend it if you can ignore few things here and there. And as always.. return it within 30 days if u dont like it but its definitely worth bringing it home for a trial atleast!",4
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"Our twins are 7 months old today as well, and have been in this stroller since they gained full control, and were able to sit up unassisted, at around 4.5 months!We used a large tandem stroller before the Jeep, but had always known (due to experience with a 5.5 and 7 year old) that we would own THE LIGHTEST, or most ""umbrella like-double stroller"".~  A cup holder for mommy/daddy. We dont use ours too much, but it can hold a Poland Spring Water Bottle, nothing else though.~  Our model has the five-point harness as well, and this is a must. The harness adjusts like a strap, not like a car seat. And they are sturdy enough to keep the boys pretty much contained~  The vinyl seats wipe up well, but also roll into a pillow, displaying a mesh side for hot days!~  The seats DO recline, and we even found that they work well for small naps, but not nearly enough for a changing table. The recline mechanism is primitive, but what do you expect for a double stroller?~  The canopies aren\'t really too bad. They do adjust, and do cover the boys heads sometimes, but as of now we have purchased two single stroller black shades and attached them onto the existing shades, and the boys seem to be fine now!~  There is no storage, but we too were able to purchase extra mesh bags to hang on the back of the stroller. We keep one mesh bag attached to the back of the stroller, and we keep two thin blankets, and my things (small vinyl purse) inside. We are able to put my diaper bag (very specialized for different ways to hang it) onto the back of the stroller like its supposed to attach, which is cool. The sum of money these two bags cost was only about $30, which is okay since we use the diaper bag for more than just stroller outings. Some packages can go onto the handles as well.~  The stroller folds with two hands, not one, and is very complicating with one foot and one hand... plus with two hands you will be able to fold it easily, and quicker. The stroller also fits well into a minivan or SUV once folded.We love our Jeep stroller. Its defiantly the easiest stroller, and it still works well on rough surfaces, and turns on a dime... Even my 7 year old can push it!",5
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"After many hours of online research I decided to purchase this Jeep stroller.  I loved it at first and thought I got a great deal based on the price and what the stroller offered.  After having it for about a month I am sending it back.  On a trip to grandma\'s I left the stroller in the back of the car and because of the heat one of the seat clips distorted and now is very loose.  I don\'t think it will hold up to my growing two year old.  The canopies also distort when folded and now they don\'t cover my kids as well as they should.  I\'m also tall at 5\'10 and the handles are not quite long enough.  I have to bend just enough where it\'s not comfortable and I tend to step/kick on the wheels/brakes when walking.  Don\'t plan to take this stroller anywhere than smooth pavement because it won\'t ride very well.  The side pockets don\'t hold much either.  A sippy cup and a small hot wheels car is about all it will hold, or maybe a diaper of two, but certainly not a flat wipes container.  Plan on putting your wipes in a zip lock.  Like I said I was thrilled to get this stroller but once used it did not meet my needs and the quality was poor.",2
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"I bought this stroller last summer when my daughter was almost 3 and I had a newborn son.  I debated over whether I needed a double stroller (my 3 year old was already, at times, not wanting to sit in a stroller anymore), so I really took my time researching the double strollers and going to Babies R Us and trying out some different ones.  Many of the front/back type double strollers were way too small for my 3 year old.  This Jeep stroller was PERFECT.  My son was sitting (reclining) in it by 1-2 months of age and at the same time my 3 year old could hop in and out easily at her desire.WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT THIS STROLLER:- The reclining seats- How easy it is to collapse and throw in my truck- How little room it takes up in my trunk- This stroller is SUPER LIGHT for a double- Smooth ride- I am 5\'8"" and have never kicked the wheels while walking,as  some have complained aboutWHAT I DON\'T LIKE ABOUT THIS STROLLER- The sun shades are worthless.  I removed them after the first use.  They are very small and very flimsy.Overall, if you are in need of a double stroller, I would say do what I did and buy this one....it is so inexpensive but not ""cheap"". Like I said, I wasn\'t even sure if I needed a double stroller...but it turned out that I did use it quite a few times.  My daughter is out of the stroller stage now, so I am selling the stroller, after only having it for less than a year.  I do not regret the purchase, though, because the stroller was perfect when I did need it.",5
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"I have owned an expensive tamdem stroller and it was too big. I didn\'t like the fact that I couldn\'t see both of my children. It wasn\'t compact and didn\'t fit in my van either.This stoller is perfect.  It\'s light weight, easy to assemble and use.  Also, I am able to see both of my children at the same time! You can\'t beat the price either.  I am very happy with this stroller!",5
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"I LOVE this stroller!  I bought it a few weeks ago for my 8 month old twins.  Now that they have outgrown their infant carrier car seats, I found myself not quite as happy with the Graco Duo Glider.  I wanted both kids to have a ""nice view"" when going on outings.  So, I sold that and now use this Jeep stroller!  It\'s so cute!  I love how it can ""vent"" for hot summer days!  It steers wonderfully, even with one baby weighing significantly more than the other (one child is 20 lb., while my other is only 14 lb).  I even have used it with just one baby in it and it still steers great!  Also, I had one baby fall asleep, and the other didn\'t, and I was able to easily recline the seat of the one who fell asleep, while leaving the other seat erect for the awake baby; GREAT feature!  It folds so nice and compact!!  I just love this stroller!!!  It is so much easier to maneuver than the Duo Glider!  I have been able to hang a pretty heavy diaper bag off the handle bars, and even when the babies are out of the stroller, it didn\'t tip it over, and that impressed me!  I haven\'t had problems going through any door-ways yet.  I mean, it has been a tight squeeze, but it fits through!  My ONLY gripe.....no storage basket.  That would have been SO handy!  Then this would be the ultimate for me!  Thus, my rating of 4 stars and not the full 5.  Maybe Jeep can make a storage basket you could buy after market and attach it to the bottom!!!  Please?!  :)",4
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,We went looking on line trying to find the best double stroller. We have a 18 month old and one on the way. We found this one online and went to toys r us to look at it. We loved it. The cup holder is pretty useless. But we don\'t care. Target had Amy Coe Diaper bags that had stroller attachment straps. I went and bought one we tried it out went back two days later for another. We even went to Taste of Minnesota with this stroller and both bags and it worked great. THe Amy Coe bags have great storage and work great with this Stroller. I tried lifting other strollers at toysrus and the were just too heavy and awkard. This one is a little light but not so awkward to lift. The latch for keeping it locked is too long. We are thinking maybe a bunjee cord so it can close tighter. It is really easy to close. We love it and so does our 18 month old,5
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"Everything about this stroller is great, the size, weight, portability, ease of use, etc... except for the sun/rain covers, they are flimsy and pretty much useless. Overall a winner though, glad I bought it and would recommend it to others.",4
Fisher-Price Aquarium Play Yard,"We registered for thisw item so we could use it as a changer in our bedroom till Baby moves to the nursery.  She absolutely loves the song playing mode, and will watch the dangling fishies contentedly while being changed or sponge bathed.  My DH and I even managed a quick ""snuggle"" while she listened to the long-playing song mode.  A great item--so far we love all of the Ocean Wonders line!",5
Fisher-Price Aquarium Play Yard,"I was so excited the first time I put this together.  It took me less than 5 minutes and now I can have it set up in 2 minutes.  The part that takes me the longest is putting the bars together for the mattress.This is the BEST travel crib.  It comes with the carrying case, everything nicely wraps together to go in the bag with a handle.  It also comes with the mobile which can be placed with an arm over the crib or inside the crib when the baby is bigger.  Perfect for newborns!!",5
Fisher-Price Aquarium Play Yard,"This item was not available when we had our daughter or we would have had it then!  I LOVE the Ocean Wonders set and when I saw this play yard it was no different and we had to have it for our next arrival.We had a bad experience with our first play yard and had to return it for a Graco.  I was dead set against anything but another Graco until we got to play with this one.  I was really happy when we saw it was just as great as our Graco and it works the exact say way.  I actually like this model better and for once I am happy we gave all our previous baby stuff away!  This one is easy to set up and collapse.  It folds up and has the matching carrying bag plus it matches all our other baby gear.But the one thing I liked best was it didn\'t have all the silly extras that the others do .  When we bought our first one I thought we had to have it all!  We ended up dropping $150 bucks on a basic play yard with a changing unit, soothing unit and storage bins.  I seemed great until we had our daughter.  Within days the little wiggle worm was rolling over and was able to get herself under the changer.  She became stuck under there at 2 weeks old and it was taken off for good.  The diaper stacker kept falling off and the wipe hold let them dry out.  The soother scared her to death!  She hated the vibrate, nature noises, music and light!  Poor thing would wake up from a dead sleep if we pushed and of those button.  So by the one month mark we had it stripped down to just a plain old play yard like this one.But the one thing this one has that none of the rest have is the cool swimming fish mobile and soother.  Something about the Ocean Wonders soothers worked for us.  The ocean waves never failed to calm our daughter.  We actually purchased a second OW aquarium to hook to her play yard for that very reason.  But this one comes with its own.  It\'s really is great!We had all the Ocean Wonders stuff for our daughter and when the time came to buy for our son we bought it all again.  It is great and you will not be disappointed with any of it.  They only complaint I have it there are not more pieces!  I would love to see a matching excersaucer and travel system!",5
Fisher-Price Flutterbye Dreams Swing,"This swing is wonderful, keeps my daughter entertained for as long as I need. The music bar with lights will flip to the back if she\'s just in the mood to look around or to easily get her in and out. She loves the music, lights and even loves to look at the stripes on the fabric. Can you stand it!! This swing is a blessing! You won\'t be sorry, worth every cent.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","its good for the price except these drawbacks1. to pick the baby u need to remove that rim you cant just slide it back.2. to adjust the seat position we need to press both the buttons(on two sides) with 2 hands and then adjust the seat, so someone  should help u cant do it alone",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I have a fussy grandson and this chair works like a charm for him.  We just turn on the white noise and put him and this chair and like magic, he calms down.  Love it!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Positive Attribute:  Good with older siblings who can sit in it and rock without damaging the rocker.  Other bouncy seats are rather flimsy and cannot survive an older sibling\'s play.Negative Attribute:  Toys attach with velcro.  This eliminates the possibility of using other toys with the rocker and using the rocker\'s toys with other baby equipment (ie. with arches or car seat).Overall -Worth the money and is nice having for the baby.,3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We have about 3 different swing/chair/bouncer things and this is by far the best one! Especially for the price. Our son loved it as a newborn and at 15mos old, he is still using it as his chair. We ended up buying 3: one for our house, and one for each grandparents\' house. Great product.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This seat is fantastic and reasonably priced. My newborn sleeps in it day and night and it is lightweight to carry from room to room. I had an older model for my other 2 kids and we got years of use out of it. Don\'t bother with those small &#34;bouncy seats&#34; get one of these rockers instead!!!!,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this rocker for my mom for when she watches our little girl a few days a week.  From what I can see so far, I wish I would have bought this instead of a bouncer for our house.  You can\'t ask for much more....it has fun colors, a nice removeable toy bar, music, seat vibration, and best of all it converts to a toddler seat.  This product will by far outlast our bouncer and you can\'t beat the price.  Very happy with this purchase- would definitely buy it again!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair is nice to get if you have a larger baby (like my son) who quickly outgrows smaller playseats.  He didn\'t like to sit in it for too long, because there\'s a hard, board seat without too much padding.  He did like the toys pretty well, but sometimes got frustrated when he couldn\'t pull them towards himself more (mainly to chew on).  The toys are detachable and can be used seperately when the child gets older.The ""kickstand"" feature is nice for securing the seat to put baby in it, or to stabalize for young infants.  Never used the ""calming vibrations"" feature.  Fairly easy to assemble (and disassemble, when it needs to go into storage).",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","The really cool thing about this chair is that it\'s big and strong enough for my older child to sit comfortably.  As for the baby, I usually don\'t leave him in there because the toys aren\'t interesting and he wants to get out.  However, I do kick out the bottom piece that holds it steady instead of rocking, and I\'ve been using it to feed him.  The cover is really easy to remove for cleaning, and the fabric doesn\'t fade in the wash.  I\'ve probably washed it 15 times in four months (baby food, you know...) and it comes out looking brand new.  Vibration is noticeable but not jackhammer-like, like so many other chairs.  Soothing.I wish it folded up a little more for storage, but it\'s not a big deal.  Four stars instead of five because the toys are boring; no music or lights, etc.  So it\'s not really interesting for a very young baby.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This isn\'t the exact one we have, but it is very close. My son has always loved this seat and still likes to try to get in it and rock back and forth!",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Our baby is 19 pounds and she sometimes squirms, twists, or leans far backwards or forwards in the chair, but we\'ve had no problems because she is buckled in reasonably tightly. Overall, we are pleased, though it is cheaply manufactured. The screws have needed to be retightened at the base after just a few months use, but for $35 what do you expect. ""Made in China"" does not usually mean world class quality, lol. Apart from that it is stable, attractive, and doesn\'t have all the annoying sound effects of many of the bouncy chairs.If you are concerned about the baby leaning too far forward, then put the toy bar up and the baby can\'t lean forward. It has a kickstand you can use if you need to leave the baby unattended for any period of time. I don\'t mean to slam the other parents, but I suspect that their issues with the chair came from misuse. It is much easier to get mad at a product or a corporate manufacturer than it is to accept responsibility when an accident happens. Reread many of the negative reviews and you hear things like ""we don\'t know how it happened but..."" If the baby is buckled in and either the kickstand is engaged or the toy bar is up the baby cannot tip the chair unless his/her last name is Houdini!If you have a big baby get this chair as it will last 2x longer than the standard bouncy chairs which hold infants only to 22 lbs.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I bought this for my six month old son and he loves it. It\'s bright and colorful and surprisingly easy to assemble. It\'s great for naps or playtime!,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I love this seat.  Since he was born, our little one has been able to use this chair in all three positions:  Upright as a rocker, reclined with the kickstand, and super reclined, almost supine.  When he is stuffy with a cold, and laying flat makes it even more difficult to breath, he sleeps comfortably in this chair, slighly reclined.  And he LOVES the vibrating action.  The detachable toys make this chair even more versatile.  I definitely recommend this as a must-have!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",The instructions said snap closure at back there was no fastener to secure same. Also the toys are very close to baby\'s face,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My daughter at 5 weeks enjoys being in this rocker.  She can see me and rock herself while I am in the kitchen.  At the moment, she is not interested in the mobile attachment.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This rocker is truly versatile and will have a much longer usage time than a regular bouncy seat. My now 4-month old daughter loved the chair as a newborn - we\'d put the kickstand up and she was really comfortable there. During a lot of those long first nights, she\'d spend almost all night in the chair as it wrapped her a little more tightly than if she was just in her crib.Now that she\'s a little older, she loves sitting in this chair while the family has dinner or while I prepare dinner - she can check everything out.I would agree the toy bar is flawed in that the cow faces outward. We\'ve \'fixed\' that by hanging the string/velcro upside down (hard to explain!) - makes it a little less stable than it otherwise would be, but so far it\'s working well.I sure wish I\'d had this seat for my now 2 1/2 year old! The seat we had then sat far too upright for a newborn, so we couldn\'t even use it until he was about 3 months old, and he quickly outgrew it. In fact, we sometimes find our son sitting in his little sister\'s rocker, though at 32 pounds and 36 inches tall, he\'s a little too big.All in all, a really great buy - good price and terrific product.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My mother purchased this chair for my son and when it came, I was disappointed on the quality of the parts. It\'s cheap metal and plastic. My son has issues with gas and reflux so he is in the chair a lot when sleeping as I am afraid to lay him down, the chair is ok as he is only 5 weeks old. My daughter wants to sit in it and when she gets in, it sways. She is 23 months and only 24lbs, it shouldn\'t be that flimsy! The screws are as tight as they can be, but the plastic is just cheap. I will be buying another chair as soon as we can. I just do not trust this chair to hold my children.We had purchased a Jeep brand travel bouncer for my daughter from a tag sale and it is sturdy! 2 years later it is still intact and usable.",2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",We loved this for our small baby. He napped in it a lot and played in it a lot. I\'m not sure how I feel about the Toddler Rocker feature.,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My mother in law has this seat and I thought I wanted one until this weekend, my second child is now sitting up and officially hates this chair.  It doesn\'t allow the baby to lie down (seated recline instead), and you also can\'t secure it in an upright position.  So, my newly sitting but not quite steady baby was either uncomfortable because he was fighting the chair to sit up, or fighting not to rock.  He loved it as a newborn though, and my toddler loves to sit in it when we\'re over.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This rocker is cute but does not support babys head from falling to the side. Not suitable for infant. My baby is 11lbs. When he sits in it his chin touches his chest and it looks uncomfortable. Im sure he will grow using it but not now...,2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I purchased this for my then 1 month old grand daughter since she I would be keeping her a couple days a week when her mother returns to work.  I liked the fact that it is adjustable and can be used for a toddler as well since I already has so much baby gear.  The price was great and it was easy to put together.  She LOVES it.  She is very alert and needs to be visually stimulated.  The toys are held on by velcro so you can easily change them with others making it more entertaining for her.  I also love the vibrations as it keeps her more content- she has some reflux issues.  Since it is so light I take it with me when we go visiting as she hates staying in her car seat.  My dauther is jealous and it has ended up at her house a few times.  I was initially looking for a bouncee seat in a second hand baby store, but for the price this was a much better deal.  I highly recommend it!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought the Princess Mouse and the Bug Friends seats for my twin Grandchildren when the were 2 months old. I needed a safe place for them to sit and take naps while they paid visits. Little did I know what a great investment they were! When it came time for solid feedings, they sat in these chairs. I just removed the toy bar, which is very easy for an adult to remove. I don\'t know why there are any negative reviews on difficulty of taking a baby out of the seat, all you have to do is release the toy bar from the chair. The babies are 6 mos old now and they still use them to sit in, pull the music toy, which they both love and pull on them over and over again.. eat, drink their bottles, take naps, etc.. (just pull the bottom stabilizer bar out and put the seat back in recline position for naps). They\'re old enough now where they can grab onto and swat at the dangling toys on either side of the music pull. Just to see their smiles when they come over and sit in those chairs just melts my heart! I absolutely love them and so do the babies. Money well spent as far as I\'m concerned! .. and to add, all it takes is a little common sense when it comes to using any children\'s equipment where safety is concerned. ;)",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This is a great infant seat, it was easy to assemble (in all fairness, my husband did it, but I supervised), it\'s good quality, the pink princess mouse print is cute. It\'s sturdy and I think it will hold up well. I love that it can grow with the baby through toddlerhood as a rocker. (We use it for my newborn but my 2 year old tried out the rocker and she gives her approval) The vibrations are not too weak or too strong, it\'s just right for soothing my little one to sleep. She seems comfortable and she sleeps well in her seat. This seat is well worth the price and I am happy with my purchase.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My 8 month old daughter loved this seat because if offered her the chance to sit upright and she enjoyed being able to remove the toys herself (velcro), but as she learned to rock it, she tipped the entire thing over on her face, bringing the chair down on top of her (she was strapped in) and the toy bar down over her head.  She was not hurt (small red bump) but was very frightened (as were my husband and myself).  Luckily we were both right there with her and were able to extract her from the chair very quickly.  It did take two of us to get her up, one to move the chair and one to pick up the baby (who was still attached).  I do not reccomend this chair!  There are safer versions available.",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I wanted this because I knew my 2 year old would try to sit in or play with anything this baby had.  She is 33 lbs so I needed something that would take that weight and be functional for my newborn.My son will sleep GREAT in it while in the reclined position. My Daughter loves to rock in it.The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because I see that it has stability issues.  I have had to teach my daughter not to lean on it when my son is in it because it will tip fairly easily.  I noticed the newer rocker Fisher Price made seems thicker in the legs which may be more stable.  But other than that this is an awesome chair for our kids.,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","LO (11 weeks) seems to like this, as it props her upright and she can look around. The toy bar is good and the middle toy plays a brief musical interlude when you pull the handle (LO is too small to do this herself yet). She also likes that the chair rocks when she moves (teaches cause and effect) but she doesn\'t like the \'soothing vibrations\' mode - I think this scares her a little. She might like it when she gets bigger. It doesn\'t rock back very far, which is probably a safety thing but it would be good if it rocked back a little further than it does. Still a great product, well made, and one that will last a while.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Ok, I have to say that since I became a mom 3 yrs. ago, I have LOVED FP toys! And this bouncy seat/rocker has been one of my favorites! I gave it up recently when my 1 1/2 yr. old was tired of it after using it with my now 3 yr. old AND I just have to say  that it was a life-saver sometimes! I wish all their stuff was this good! You\'ll have to read more of my reviews about OTHER toys to see what disappointed me....This bouncy/toddler rocker is a good buy! You won\'t regret it!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",We received this as a gift when our daughter was born. She loved this seat and so do we. It allowed her to be in the same room as all of us and be able to be at our level (on the floor) while we played games with her brother. Our 3 year old son also loves it. He of course uses it as a rocking chair. Its a very versatile gift :),4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I purchased this rocker when my daughter was 4 months old as a replacement for her bouncy seat, as she was wanting to sit up more and look around.  We have been very happy with the rocker except for one main issue;  when your child starts to be able to sit up unsupported, ALWAYS have the kickstand out, my daughter, like many of the other reviewers here have mentioned, could have easily flipped over in the chair while strapped in.  All in all, a pretty good product, the cover is washable and it has held up well so far to hard use.  My older daughter (2 1/2) also likes to sit in it when the baby\'s out, so it is getting plenty of use!",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Please beware when purchasing this chair. My 11 month old son has flipped this chair over on more than one occassion and I am now putting it away for good. The other day I had him in the chair and I went to answer the door and was only gone for a brief moment and he flipped the chair backwards and he hit his face on the side of my bedside table and put a big gash in his cheek. So please, please be careful with this chair.",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My son loved his rocker when he was an infant.  It is not good for a child when they are learning to sit up ( i just put my son in a differt toy) and now that he in one and walking, he still loves the chair.  He cilmbs into it too just sit and is proud of himself when he can rock by himself.  Great chair and a great buy.  Kids will use it for years. My son is now 6 and still uses the same one to sit and play video games.  It is a great buy when a kid is able to use it for 6 years.  Love it so much that I bought another one for the new baby.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","If you are looking for that perfect baby gift-look no further this is it.  This is the one item I didn\'t receive during all the baby showers and gifts I received while waiting for our newest addition.  I never thought at my age that I would have a little one in my house again as my other children are now grown.  Of all the swings, seats and play mats, this is the seat that my now 4 month old loves.  He sits in it for very long periods at a time, completely at ease and entertained with the vibration on.  Day-care also has these seats and they have told me that he loves it.  The colors are bright and eye catching, the toys are placed where they can easily be seen and grabbed at when he reaches that stage.Assembly was very easy.  All that is needed is a Philips head screw driver and a little time.  Instructions are easy to follow but I didn\'t need them.  There are just a few parts to put together and you can see from the picture on the box where each piece goes.  The cover is easy to put on and remove in order to clean.  The batteries are under the cover, closed with a screw to keep little fingers and mouths out of danger.  It keeps him happy and entertained while I am working around the house and that makes me happy.  I would rate it more than 5 stars if allowed.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair is durable, easy to clean, efficiently uses battery.  I prefer it to our Snugabunny bouncer, which we got as a gift after already purchasing the infant-to-toddler rocker.  The Snugabunny is harder to clean and takes up more space.  Yes, this rocker is not as cute or as plush, but it works great.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I love this chair & I definitely recommend it 2 everyone i know! It has been such a life-saver since the day we brought my son home. he\'s is 6 months now sitting up by himself & never once has he fallen forward. & he LOVES LOVES LOVES to explore everything. He\'s leaned forward in it before but he never seems to even look like he is going to fall & he\'s over 17 lbs. I read one review that said her child got out of the safety belt! You must have an amazaing baby because I don\'t think my son has ever even came close to that either! ITS A GREAT CHAIR that can be used FOREVER (my nephew 2 & 1/2 still uses it to watch movies & loves it) Don\'t let the reviews scare you this chair is great & I mean if you are worried then just keep your baby close or keep a very close eye on them & nothing will happen! Enjoy!Mami Bree,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","The chair is made defective.  There is no weight in the top of the chair so when a child reaches for a toy, for example, on the floor the chair will go over and your child is at risk for a head injury.  Do not put a child who can\'t stand in this chair.",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Bought for us by my father in law. and i hate it.  it\'s not a swing, not a bouncer, just a chair that vibrates.  our son isn\'t even born yet and i don\'t want him in the chair.  The toys that hang come off when you barely touch them and are heavy plastic. i also heard it\'s very dangerous and tips over.  i hate this chair.",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This seat has been sooooo perfect! It reclines enough so my newborn can be comfortable (she actually uses it to sleep in a lot of the time.) It\'s big enough for my two year old also. I like that it rocks easily, but can also stay stationary. It\'s bright and colorful! The only thing I dont really like is where the toy bar is.I feel like my daughter is going to get hit in the head by the toys (but she never does.) I would definitely recommend this seat!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","First off, I have last years model. From what I can tell, the difference is the color scheme. I bought this for my daughter when she was about 4 months old. She\'s 11 months now. At first, she didn\'t like the vibrating, as it made her itchy and she\'d rub her face. Now that she\'s older, she\'s OK with the vibrating mode. It\'s nice and portable and is good for keeping her put for a short while. She does get bored in it if stuck there for too long...but not much more than others things that are confining. At her current age, the activity center does the job a little better, but a bit bulkier, so this is great for hauling into the bathroom and keeping her safe and in view while I shower. Oh, so now that\'s she older she is able to yank off the toys that can be velcroed to the top bar. Not a big deal. Try the linkadoos and attach your kid\'s toy du jour to  the links...attached in turn to the waist strap. DD is fond of throwing toys overboard these days, so with the links, they don\'t go far, and she can then reach over and retrieve them herself.NOW, I MUST MENTION TWO things I don\'t like about this item. FIRST, my daughter isn\'t yet tall enough to reach her feet to the floor and rock herself, and she gets a bit frustrated at staying still in the non-rocking position for too long. I know that in time, she\'ll grow and that issue will be resolved.But, the MOST IMPORTANT thing to note, is not to assume your child is safe and secure if you dash out of site for a moment. My daughter leans so far forward in the chair now (but is unable to reach the floor with her feet), that the entire cloth back just comes forward with her, since she\'s strapped in. No big deal I thought, until...I left the room for a moment, and when I returned, she was crawling on the floor! I have NO idea how my little houdini did it, but I had her buckled in...and the waist strap was still buckled! The chair wasn\'t even overturned! There she was nearby examining our heat register in the floor. We were VERY lucky since there were other non-baby-safe items within her reach and the door to the room was open...and the house not yet completely baby-proofed. My husband and I were in utter amazement and the only thing we could come up with is that she leaned so far forward to reach something on the ground in front of her, that her body just folded over itself and she simnply somersaulted out of the chair...her legs sliding out of the belt (and it\'s on the tightest setting...but still doesn\'t fit as snug as I think it should...but I never thought THAT would happen). The chair must have just rocked back into it\'s upright position...and there she was crawling around happy-go-lucky; unscathed by the event.I still think the chair is a good thing...will last longer than a bouncer. However, NOW, if I have to dash out of site for a moment, I make sure the rocker is in the non-rocking position so that it doesn\'t lean with her if she tries to reach forward too far.This just seems to be an awkard stage to get it\'s best use.If they could improve upon the fit of the harness belt, and make the cloth back somehow not move so much with the baby as he/she leans forward while belted in...I would give it five stars.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","When our son was first born I would recline him back and he would either sleep while I got things done or would watch the toys above his head.  Now he\'s 7 months old and I\'d consider this more of a convenience rocker than anything else.  It slides around the house very easily so I take him to the bathroom with me, the kitchen, etc. The vibrator doesn\'t interest my son yet.  He\'s not old enough to rock yet, but I\'m sure he will.  My son has not been active enough to flip it forward like some of the other children in these reviews.  He gets a bit bored in it, so if I\'m planning on cooking or doing something for a long period of time then I pull out his exersaucer type thing.  The toys don\'t cut it for him anymore so I give him his own toys while he\'s sitting in it watching me shower.I only have one complaint.  I have been using this for feeding my son since he wasn\'t able to sit on his own yet for the high chair.  It has to be in the upright position (rocker position) for feeding, therefore it won\'t lock in place.  I have to sit on the ground and straddle my legs under it sometimes when he\'s active to keep it steady and to keep the food from getting all over him.If I were to shop all over again I would check out all the bouncers and try to find one that locks when put in the upright position.  You\'ll need to think about feeding your baby in it before he or she is ready for the high chair.  One more tip...you\'ll need a bouncer to push around the house for your baby before they crawl so you can get things done.  Make sure your bouncer can hold a baby until they\'re AT LEAST 9/10 months.  My baby is 7 months old and is showing no signs of crawling soon.  He is 17 lbs and about 27"" long, so this one is great for that.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This item is great and very easy to put togather. She will have years of playtime this as it is very well made.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I like this chair for my son; however, it is it very loud when the vibrate mode is on. He currently weighs 16 lbs, and I hope it will be quieter when he weighs a little more.  Right now I stuff a pillow under the seat so it will help absorb some of the vibrating noise.  He seems to like the chair.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",My baby spends at least 2 or 3 hours of the day sitting in this seat.  I really consider every mother to have it.  My older kid already has 3 years snd still use it to watch TV.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We, too, had an accident with this product.  Just today, my 7 month old daughter (21 pounds) flipped the seat forward and landed on her forehead on our hardwood floor.  Big egg on forehead above eye.  If your infant can sit upright and leans forward -- and is on the heavier side -- it\'s going to flip.Any product that causes an accident does not deserve more than one star no matter what.",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this 2nd hand for my granddaughter to have at Grandma\'s house when she was born.  She loved it from the minute she was born until recently.  She is now almost [...].  She would sit and rock and watch her TV shows, read books or rock her babies to sleep.  There is nothing that I can think of that you can use from the time a baby is born until they are [...]!  I recently bought this as a gift for another new Mom.  The cover washes easily, has the vibration that infants love and easily adjusts to sit up or lay back with no problem.  It\'s made by Fisher Price - how can you go wrong?  You can\'t.",5

He doesn\'t like to opened space of the crib and cradle either.  Loves the vibration.  He can sleep in it with the kick stand up or down.  He is 6 weeks old now and I was so glad I had this and it was already put together when we brought him home.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This rocker has been so helpful to me when I need my hands free and a safe place to put my daughter! I registered for this because I knew three other babies that had it and loved it. We started using it when our daughter was one month old. Friends/family had stopped coming around to help each day so I could no longer just hand the baby off when I needed to eat, go to the restroom, or do the dishes, etc., and baby would scream if I put her down. So I started putting the rocker next to me and rocking it with my foot while I made/ate my meals each day or typed at the computer. Now that she\'s older (12 weeks) and content for longer without being rocked, I can even put her in her rocker just outside the shower and talk/sing to her while I get ready. She\'s never really liked the vibration feature as the other babies I know do, but she loves to rock. If you place it on a hard floor baby can rock herself when she kicks. The toy attachments still seem to overstimulate her at this point (she stares at them way too hard and gets very frustrated) so I just dont use them. Since I breastfeed, I still hold my baby most of the day, but when I need to get things done where she can still be right next to me this rocker has been a real life saver. Even if you\'re a big proponent of slings and wraps as I am, there are times when it\'s safer not to ""wear"" your baby, e.g. eating, cooking, restroom.  A couple things I recommend: put a soft hand towel or blanket under a younger baby\'s head in it because the fabric is a little rough on their heads/hair if they move around a lot--just be sure you\'re with them at all times if you do. If your baby falls asleep in the rocker, you\'ll probably want to roll up a soft cloth and place it between their head and the frame so their head and neck are supported.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We received this as a gift at our baby shower.  My son, who is now almost 3, has used it since the day he was born and continues to love it.  The fact that it is adjustable is wonderful too.  He was a big baby, and had outgrown the baby bouncers by the time he was just a couple of months, this he still enjoys using.I also run a daycare and every child loves that rocker.  Ours is old and warn and we\'ll probably have to get another with our next child, but it has held up through three years of daily use by multiple children, you really can\'t expect much more than that.  I have found that there is a stretch of time from the time a baby starts crawling until they start walking that the chair really isn\'t the best.  At this age they have the coordination to wiggle themselves to the point they fall out.  Most babies seem to be able to get out on their own safely by the time they start walking though.  We almost put it away when we hit that stage and I\'m so glad we didn\'t!Charlene",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My Granddaughter love\'s it at 2 mo. old and I\'m super excited because, my grandson had one that lasted until he was almost 4! Best Baby product to buy!!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I had the chair 2 years ago with my first, but my brother ended up breaking it on us.  We got the same chair this time around because I wanted something that was going to last me awhile.  We like this chair! Our newborn very often sleeps in here, thanks to the recline feature (wasn\'t on our first chair). When the baby isn\'t in it, my 2 year old will put the kickstand in and sit in the chair.  The only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is because of the cow on the toy bar...my 2 week old loves to stare at it, but it faces the wrong way!  As for it tipping, with our first, we didn\'t  let him rock when he was learning to sit up.",4

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","After our baby broke her bouncer (from excessive bouncing) we tried the rocker.  She didn\'t seem to like sitting in it nearly as much as her previous bouncer, but it worked until she outgrew chairs all together.  The toys are great and we really liked how solid the chair felt.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","So far our two month old grandchild loves this rocker.

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","During the height of my baby\'s ""colic"", i purchased an insane amount of items. The Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker was one of those items.While my son didn\'t care about it much during his more insane times, he now (at almost four months) enjoys sitting (and playing) in it. The toy bar is great for hanging other toys on (and it comes with toys of its own). I hang the Baby Einstein octopus from the bar and baby loves to grab at it since it\'s big and easy for him to reach. The toys that the chair comes with don\'t hang very low and are hard for baby to grab at, but I\'m sure he\'ll be able to as he gets older.I would love if this chair would rock on its own, but you can rock it with your foot or hand if you want. I also like the kickstand that comes out if baby falls asleep and you want to lie him back and be more stationery.I also wish is that the chair vibrated a little more. Even with a new battery the vibrating isn\'t very significant, however, my son is a fan of items with more powerful/strong movements, so this vibration might be enough for a baby who isn\'t quite so high maintenance!Overall this chair is recommended, and it\'s awesome that it can be used well into toddler years. Great shower gift as well.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","It doesn\'t take up too much space, and very easy to put together.  I would buy it as a gift for someone.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Easy to put together my son likes his chair. He likes the music and likes to grab the musical piece in the middle; the other two toys are a little harder to reach. I wish they were longer. Also I wish the music lasted a little longer than a few seconds. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","If I could go back in time and not purchase this product, I would not purchase it. At first it seemed OK. My daughter liked to play with the hanging toys and she would rock herself a little and have fun. In the beginning she enjoyed the chair. As time went on and our daughter grew, the chair did not &#34;grow with her.&#34; I say this because as our daughter gained more weight, the rocking would cause the toys to fly back and forth and hit her in the face repeatedly. The chair is just clumsy in general. When the child is older the chair can convert into a toddler chair, so it might be OK to bring it out again at a later date. But in between being a small infant and a much older toddler who can sit in the chair, there is a time frame during which the chair is just not useable. I am only speaking from experience, but basically I had to put the chair away when our daughter reached about 9 months because she kept getting slapped in the face by the hanging toys, which of course made her cry to be taken out of the chair. So, with that in mind, you should decide if this chair is really right for you and especially for your baby.",2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Im not sure how the previous commenter\'s son ended up upside down. My mother bought this rocker for my son when he was born, and in the past five months he has just loved it. I put it in the kitchen so he can watch me cooking from a safe distance, and have something to entertain him.THeres really no way for the rocker to flip, as it has plastic knobs on the bottom front and back that prevent it from rocking all the way back or forward. Also, theres a metal frame in the front that can flip out and it forces the chair to stay still, if you dont want the rocking. my son, who is 20 lbs can easily rock it on his own by just kicking his feet, which he loves. Sometimes I use the stationary position when Im trying to feed him.It wasnt until just a few weeks ago that he actually began to reach out and pull the middle string to cause the ""if youre happy and you know it"" song to play. I personally thik that the song plays very loud and shrill, but i guess babies like high pitched music. Also, it takes a pretty hard pull to activate the song, which is why he was not able to do it before 4 1/2 months. It would have been nice if the two outside animals would make a noise too when pulled.I especially like that the hanging toys arc can easily be removed and the chair can transition long into toddlerhood as a big boy rocker even after he starts to walk and can get in and out himself.THe bright colors are very vibrant and mine has not faded at all. THe material is soft and sturdy. Also, the metal frame seems to be very strong and durable.All in all, i think its a great chair for newborns to toddlers and look forward to getting much more use out of it.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We had the original version of this chair several years ago.  We bought an additional chair of the same version once we had three kids. The chair came in handy when we needed an extra hand, and the kids seemed to like the chairs as they grew.  We now buy one of these chairs for all the baby showers we get to along with Calmoseptine, having four kids, these two products were truly worth every penny and more.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I bought this chair for my 11 week old grandson to have in the living room with me when he is over. It works great as I can rock him or he can sit up and watch TV. When he falls asleep I can put out the kickstand and he is laying down. However I have read reviews about older babies tipping over so I will get something else for him as he starts to sit up by himself but for little ones around 3 or 4 months it is great!,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Very nicely built, sturdy. Looks like it will last. The reason for four stars is the music is really short on pull toy and our baby loves music! Price was incredible. Buy it!",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Very sturdy, vibrates, lays back or sits up and rocks. The bar has toys to keep them busy. Very happy with this purchase.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My baby will stay easily for 30 minutes playing it the toys, materials are good and easy to wash, I just do not use much the &#34; vibration&#34;  as it might be a little too soft. I expect this to continue to be useful for quite some time since it adjust to other positions.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","It\'s a nice, safe place to put my baby.  However, she doesn\'t like it all that much.  She doesn\'t care for the vibration.  I\'ve even gotten her to pull the handle that makes the cow sing (she\'s only 3 months).  But, she doesn\'t like to sit there very long at all.  She prefers her swing to this rocking chair.  I am hoping that when she is a little bigger and can rock the chair that she might like it a little better.  Also, like another reviewer had said, the cow attaches so that it\'s back is toward the baby.  I took the velcro off and sewed it onto the other side so that my daughter could see his face.UPDATE- Now that my baby is 5 months old, she likes this rocking chair.  She likes to play with the toys.  Hopefully, as she gets older and learns to rock, she will like it even more.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Love this chair for babies and toddlers, always get as a baby gift and for the infant/toddler classrooms that I purchase for. Very sturdy and grows with the child.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We bought this chair for our son before he was born because we liked that it would be useful longer than the regular bouncers.  We could not be happier with our choice.  This chair was such a lifesaver when he was tiny.  We have a great baby but there times in the day when he was fussy and Mommy had to get things done.  So, I would put him in the chair and turn on the vibrations and immediatly he would be happy again.  The chair does take one D battery but it has lasted forever for us.Our son liked to rock so we never used the chair with the kickstand out until recently.  He is now 7 1/2 months old and like other reviews, he sits up and I was afraid that he would fall completely over.  So, I put the kickstand out and he still likes to lay in it for a little while.  The toy bar and toys have been great too.  Our son has always liked the toys and still plays with them, even sometimes when he is not in the chair.We will have to see how he does with the toddler rocker later.  He is tall so I don\'t think he will have some of the problems other people are having with it.Overall, I think this chair was a great investment and would buy it again if given the opportunity.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This bouncer is GREAT! My son was 3 weeks old when we started using it and he LOVES it... At times, he wouldnt sleep in his crib or his bassinet so we were able to pick up the seat and put it inside his crib and he slept peacefully... This is a great seat and it\'s the best bouncer I\'ve come across...",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair can tip over if your child reaches forward, overbalancing the chair.  My son tipped the chair and fell face first into the hardwood floor.  Luckily, he was not seriously injured.  The instructions for the chair say NOTHING about being usafe for infants who can sit up, but that is what a representative at Fisher Price had to say about it!  ""NOT SAFE FOR INFANTS WHO CAN SIT UP.""  Shouldn\'t that be on the instructions?  Infant to Toddler Rocker is a misleading name, if that\'s the case.  The response by Fisher Price was to offer a refund.  This product should be RECALLED!  This could have led to a serious injury.  I see numerous reviews about this product being unsafe.  Where is the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission?  I called them numerous times but could not get my call returned.  BEWARE!",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Just when my wife couldn\'t be sure of leaving the baby alone in bed while she tried to fix something for lunch, and my baby was trying to sit by herself and couldn\'t stand laying on her back anymore, we found this excellent product which happens to be a perfect companion to move the baby around the house in the safety and entertainment required.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","After reading all the reviews I decided on this rocker and am really happy I did, although when I received it one of the metal pieces had a small defect that did not allow for it to be assembled properly, but we were able to fix it at home. My baby has been using it for four weeks approximately, from his 4th week. I was afraid he was going to be too small to be comfortable in this rocker but he liked it from the first time we sat him there. He is not a fan of the vibration function but he does not cry either. May be he will like it when older, so for now I simple do not use it. I have not had the problems of the tipping over that I have read in other reviews given his young age, but I will be aware when he keeps growing. I had originally just bought a swing for the baby, but swings are generally bulkier and heavier to carry than this rocker so it makes it uncomfortable and impossible to be carrying it with you from room to room, more so if you had a C-section. This rocker makes it easy for you to have the baby close to you wherever you go in the house. It fits easily through doorframes that is not the case for some swings. If I only had the opportunity to buy a swing or a rocker I would definitely go for this rocker.",5

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Bought this chair 5 months ago when my little girl was born and this has got to be one of thr best purchases ive made.My little girl naps in this chair, and sit in it while i shower or prepare meals.  The hanging toys keep her busy for at least 10 minutes at a time.  I\'ve attached the tiny love detachable mobile and my little gal is busy for 15 minutes or more!  Very pleased with the quality and value of this products.  A must have for any new parent.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",We brought this rocker because our 4 month old outgrew her bouncy seat.  She loves it!  She is now 7 months old and still uses it every day.  We do have to watch her closely in it now as she can flip it over!,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",She loves it.  The vibration is a good feature.  It is easy to put together.  The toy bar is removable which is a plus.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This was a great gift for the baby.  He really likes sitting in it.  I loved the looks of it and size.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I have bought this product about 3 years ago and my baby at that time now a little boy still use it .,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Just be aware that this kind of rockers don\'t rock well on carpets.Also the back recline is a little too steep for small babies,3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My grandma bought this for our visit to our house and now I wish I had one of my own.  My daughter loved it - she giggled every time she got the cow to play music (and that was often) and she was content to sit in it for almost an hour (which is longer than she\'ll sit in her regular bouncy seat).  My grandma (who isn\'t the most handy) had no problems putting it together.  It allowed my daughter to sit more upright and the structure of the sides kept her from slumping.  My daughter is only 5 months, so I\'m not sure how it\'ll work down the road, but it\'s wonderful so far.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We bought this chair when our baby was 10 days old.  We have used it every day and she is now 5 months old.  When she was tiny, it was a lovely safe place to put her down.  She liked the vibrations and sometimes we would rock her with our foot.  She would watch the butterflies and seemed stimulated by the mobile.  By the time she was about two and a half months old she would kick her feet and make the mobile swing and the chair rock.  Now at five months she is pulling the musical part of the mobile and playing the song.  She rocks it on her own and seems indifferent about the vibrations.I have taken this chair everywhere.  It is great on vacation because she has a place to rest.  We have taken it to family parties and when we put the kick stand out she naps in the chair.  It is sturdy; it is constantly moving from the living room to the backyard in our house.  It is easy to clean; the fabric comes off and is washable in the washing machine.I highly recommend this chair.  My husband and I keep telling people it was the best $30 we spent.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I GOT THIS FOR MY NEW GRANDDAUGHTER ,SHE LOVE ALL THE TOYS ATTACHED AND THE MUSIC .VERY WELL MADE THANK YOU",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My first son loved this as a vibrating soother seat when he was an infant. He liked sleeping in it with the kickstand down better than the swing or his bassinet(he hated the bassinet in our room). It worked great as a portable bassinet for trips too.I put it away when he was about 6-8 months old because he didnt like sitting still much and would rather have his excersaucer. I also agree with the earlier reviewer that it may tip over if an older baby tries to lean too far forward in the rocker position. Even though it never happened to us I was scared that it might. That\'s why I gave it 4 stars.When he turned one, we were moving and he discovered it and fell in love with it as his own big boy chair!  It is small enough and sturdy enough to get in and out of easily and he LOVES having his own chair.  There are little feet on the bottom that prevent tipping now that he has the muscle control to not lean too far.  He is almost 2 now and it is the only place he wants to sit.I have a second baby coming in May and he will definately need his own. I need one for my infant and my toddler!",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I bought this as a gift for my friends and they love it.  It is small enought to be portable and moved around the house wherever it is needed and sturdy enough to be safe for the baby.  The baby loves the toys and gentle vibrating.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Estoy contento con mi compra.Es un producto nuevo de buena calidad y de una marca prestigiosa.Saludos y gracias,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This bouncer/rocker is a great addition to your baby supplies. My daughter sleeps so well in it. It converts to a rocker, so it will be around the house for a while. At the price, this product is a must have. My only complaint is that the batteries in the vibrating portion of this product go out too quickly, but that could be in part of how much we UAE it.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We have been using it from day 1. The rocking is great for a newborn.  He\'s always loved the toys.  The monkey (in the older version the toy that played music was a monkey) still plays music 9 months later.  My mom has a 2nd one at her house. I have a cousin that is a year older than my son and he loves to sit and rock in this chair.  I know it\'s durable b/c my 9 year old sister will sit in it and it supports her! Now that my son is crawling and pulling himself up, we will sit the chair with the kickstand out so it is stationary in the floor and he will crawl to it and pull himself up using it. The toybar is in his playpen and he still plays with them. It\'s great to feed him in if we are somewhere without a highchair too! I have no complaints about this product!!!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This product is OK.  The one reason I do love it is my son can sit in it and eat.  I kind of use it as a high chair :)  The toys that attach to it aren\'t that great, wish they were more attractive to play with!",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I have been very happy with this rocker.  My son was born a month ago, and almost from the time we brought him home, we have been able to use the rocker and he seems to be pretty happy sitting in there.  He recently started staring very intently at the little toys and the black-and-white bar they dangle from.  He doesn\'t control his arms yet, but I\'m sure he\'ll be swatting at the toys soon.  This rocker is much more affordable than some others I looked at, but it seems very sturdy and I like that you can either set it up to rock or put down the kickstand and have it stay put.  It\'s also fairly light, so we can easily move it from one room to another.  Of all the gear we purchased for the baby, this is one of the items that has gotten the most use.  I would definitely recommend it to other new parents.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I basically like the chair, but it\'s kind of flimsy. It wasn\'t difficult to assemble, however a screw from the seat keep falling out. Before all that happened, my son was loving sitting in it.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair is great.  My son loves it!  I\'m glad that it is something that he can use and not grow out of for a long time!  The only thing That I would change is the toys.  They are attached with velcro. When my son pulls on the musical cow he ends up pulling it off, not playing the music.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I just set this bad boy up this afternoon and my son already cant get enough of it. He loves the singing toy in the middle. This was very easy to put together whitch supprised me. I would say go pick one up ASAP!!,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I love thisThey are great sturdy rockers and my child loves being in it enjoyment for bubs and time out for me lol,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I purchased this for my grandson and at almost 4 months, he weighs around 16 lbs.  His dad put it together for me and I noticed it was kind of wobbly from side to side.  I had him check it and he said it was fine and the one he had at home was the same.  I just don\'t feel very confident that it is going to hold up.  So far it has, but I am thinking with his weight, it may not be useful as a toddler and this product claims it goes from infant to toddler.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",At first I didnt like this item. it was too small for me so I let my grand daughter use it and she fits perfect and she loves it.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We got one of these in 2003 for our son.  As other reviewers have noted, it\'s important to use this product appropriately for your child\'s development level...within those limits, this chair is perfect!  We\'re expecting #2 any day now, and it occurred to me a couple of nights ago that we\'re going to need a second one.  Our son is 2 1/2, about 35lb, and still uses his rocker almost daily.  I don\'t want to push my luck expecting him to share it with the baby :)  I\'m really glad the design of the fabric has changed a little, as it will help our toddler differentiate between the two chairs.Speaking of proper use, our son will occasionally forget his common sense and stand up in the chair - facing the rear, he can lean on the back and rock, and it doesn\'t tip over backwards.  Obviously we\'re telling him to sit down as he\'s doing it, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This seat is awesome.  My daughter had the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders one (it was left over from my son) and she hated it.  She couldn\'t reach any of the toys.  In this seat she\'s more upright and can kick to rock & can also grab the toy in the middle that sings.  She loves to watch the butterflies ""dance"" when she makes the chair rock and the vibrations are perfect.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This wasn\'t what I thought it would be.  I bought it because it would go from infant to toddler years, thinking I would get the most use out of this seat.  However, it wasn\'t very functionable for our son as a new born.  It was almost too big when it was in a stationary position and it was a pain to move from room to room.  For our next new born I am buying a different one that is more comforting and soothing.  The vibrations on this seat are too much for a little baby and it doesn\'t play music. The only really good thing I have to say is that now our son is 15 months he loves using this chair as a rocking chair.  So it does make a great toddler seat, but not a great infant seat.",2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",MY 2 MONTH OLDSON HATES THE SWING AND I DECIDED TO GOWITH THIS PRODUCT AND HE LOVES IT..GOOD QUALITY AND IS REALLY GOOD.,5

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Bought it for my boy when he was about 4month old and he was too big for his bouncer from babysrus. It is perfect for me to feed him since he is too active and doesn\'t want to be held when he is eating. Recommend for anybody who has a baby!!,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Perfect for babies 3-4 months! The baby I kept loved it, I used it as a rocker, and he slept in it some, mostly watched tv, Perfectly angled to see it up higher than he sat. The toys were great! the middle toy, the baby pulls on ring, and music plays. The kickstand helps when they sleep in it - everything is fantastic, not sure why the vibration unit, baby didn\'t respond to it. Prob. not use it for awhile.  But the rest of it is great!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","what a great chair! Love the kick stand that allows the chair to recline. My 2 month old looks super comfy and naps peacefully in it! And when she wakes up, toys all up in her face to play with! LOL! Its great!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My niece has one of these and she loves it. She is almost 3, so she uses it as a rocker. When I visit my family we put my 5 month old son in it flipped back with the stand. He liked it, so we bought one. My only complaint is to get music to play, you have to hit the elephant really, much harder than he will ever be able to. Otherwise, it\'s a great investment that can be used for several years.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This rocker is pretty nice. It seems sturdy and the colors are bright and playful. My baby LOVES vibrations, so I\'m really happy it has that. My only complaint is that when the vibrations are on the toys on the toy bar bounce and wiggle quite a big causing a good deal of noise. It doesn\'t seem to bother him though, so it\'s not enough of an issue to make me send it back. The bar won\'t be on there forever.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I have the exact same rocker for my son..it was a gift from my mom in law. It\'s cute and colorful but requires a little more assembly than our other one. No big deal. I set it up and got the required D battery for the vibration effect. However, music is supposed to play from the middle toy (elephant) but it does not. I unscrewed the device which has the 3 small cell batteries the rocker came with so I\'m not sure why that feature doesn\'t work. I\'ll go back out and get the cell batteries and hopefully it\'ll work or hopefully we can return ours. ALSO, I wish there were different settings for the vibration..it\'s a little strong..",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My first daughter use to love this rocker so I decided to buy the same one for my new baby girl. She does not love it as much,but will stay in it long enough to get things done. Love that the rocker grows with child. Loved the price even more!",4

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We received this seat as a gift for our newborn and thank God we did.  Our little guy would not sleep on his back or side at first so, like our oldest son, we set him in his carrier to sleep all bundled up.  We started using this seat for sleeping after we opened it.  It sits like a popasun seat.  Just wonderful for those babies that love to be cuddled.  Now he is seven months old and sits up in the seat and rocks while watching his show or while we need a minute to get soemthing doen and need the comfort of knowing that he is in a safe place.  It really is a great seat.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This is cute but I ordered this item with the impression that it rocked by itself (battery operated) after receiving item it only has a vibration option.............so you must manually rock this yourself..........this was a waste of money for me!!!!,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This rocker has been a lifesaver for me.  My son likes to be held all the time, and this is the only thing that he will sit in for long periods of time so that I am able to get anything done around the house. I have never put batteries in the vibrating feature because he does fine without it, so I can\'t tell you how well that works. I have never let him nap in it like another reviewer suggested, but it would be great for doing so.  The seat also reclines, and it is great for feeding time, because they are sitting at a higher angle.  My mom has even bought one to keep at her house, and my mother in law wants to buy one as well.  Also, the colors on this rocker are very vibrant, which babies love, and the toys are interesting enough... I just wish the song would play a little longer.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I just purchased this chair for my 5 month old daughter.  We tried it out at a friend\'s house and my baby went bananas for it.  She is so happy in this chair, she loves the rocking motion. She laughs out loud as she rocks and loves the toy bar. As far as the calming vibration feature goes, my daughter could take it or leave it on other baby gear, so I haven\'t even put batteries in it.  I was looking for an alternative to her bouncer chair, which she likes but doesn\'t always seem to want to be in. I also like the idea that this chair can grow with her and she can have a rocking chair as a toddler. We are really pleased with it.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This rocker is one of the best item I have bought for my new baby. I used for almost everything. Even I got it to the beach and my little one take his sun bath on it! The fabric can be wash on the machine and it is quiet easy to set up. I give only 4 stars because i think this could be improved by making it more flexible to be storage easily, I mean, if you want to storage this, you have to disarm every screw and have to use a screwdriver",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Cute but very wobbly.,2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Assembly went smoothly (15-20 mins), but you need a screwdriver in order to do the job.The rocker is so nicely balanced that even the slightest movement of the baby (currently 2 1/2 months old) will cause the chair to rock, so it acts like a self-soothing mechanism: baby gets agitated, chair starts rocking, baby calms down.The vibration unit is very power efficient. 1 D size battery lasted for a month of daily use, before we had to change it.The static position of the chair is convenient for feeding or longer naps.The whole thing is very lightweight, so you can easily move it around the house.Toy bar looks nice, but our baby is not into toys yet.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I really like this bouncer and it is very useful. I\'ve been using it since my baby was born. You pull out the bottom bar and it becomes flat.. he used to fall asleep in it. He is 5 months old now and we take it around where ever he goes. ITs useful specially when we go visiting and he has a place to sit. He can\'t sit up yet so I use this to feed his cereal. I am so happy we registerd for this.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought 2 of these when my twins were born and that was almost 4 years ago. They have used it EVERY SINGLE DAY since then. They have endured all kinds of flipping and abuse by the children since they grew up a bit and the chairs are still holding up in excellent shape. The fabric teared a bit but again they have been subject to extreme use. They are 3 years and 8 montsh old now and still use it every day to watch tv and most days fall asleep in it while doing so.Don\'t think it twice, buy it! Also, this older version seems to me much more durable than the newer ones, which seem to have a lot of plastic and focused more on esthetics than durability.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Holds up great i got this when my son was 5 months old and now he is 3 and still using it he and i both love it,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I\'ve been using this chair since my son came home from the hospital as a newborn (he is now 21 months). He liked the mobile when he was younger and he will still sit in it now. Great purchase and it is easy to clean.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My 6-month old son is bananas for the ""Bug Friends"" version of this rocker -- he literally will rock and laugh in it for half an hour. It\'s also a great seat to set him into whenever I need to put him down (he\'s not walking yet), so I was carrying it up and down the stairs many times a day. I decided to get a second rocker and went with the ""Dark Safari"" because it was priced for quite a bit less ($39 vs. $52).The product, tho, is different than simply a different color, which is how it is categorized at Amazon. The bucket seat on the ""Bug Friends"" version has a sleeve on the underside for a fitted piece of hard plywood, and the ""Dark Safari"" version does not. That means that the child sinks into the ""Dark Safari"" seat. For my child that makes it more difficult for him to really rock in it.(Also, the music that plays on the ""Dark Safari"" is much shorter -- just the first line of ""Old McDonald."" ""Bug Friends"" plays a full verse of ""If You\'re Happy and You Know it Clap Your Hands."" For some people the shorter music will be a plus, for some it will be a minus. Neither piece of music bothers me, and both make my son happy.)He still likes the ""Dark Safari"" chair, although he doesn\'t get his rocking on quite so much.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this for a friend of mine that is having twin boys. So far she loves it because it has come in handy with having twins. Her 3 yr old loves it as well. Ha! She had to test it out. This is a very inexpensive gift, and is really cute & handy for any mommy-to-be.",5

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My three-month-old daughter loves it! We are so glad we bought it. She likes to make it rock herself, and she\'s a baby who needs to be held most of the time.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I got this chair because of the good price point and the multi-purpose use, as well as its long-term potential as the chair can be adjusted to grow with the baby. My 3 month old son likes being in this chair. It doesn\'t bounce, but he never seemed too interested in bouncy chairs anyway. The dangling toys intrigue him, but I wish the center toy that pulls had a more musical song rather than a low quality beeping version of the Three Little Monkeys tune. When my son gets bored with the dangle toys, I replace it with the Tiny Love Sunny Stroll arch, which fits well and keeps him entertained.The seat cover is made of polyester so it washes well. However, the bottom of the seat is supported by a hard board, so when my baby gets excited and kicks, his feet bang against a hard surface. I put a soft fluffy blanket over the seat to help cushion the seat more.The rocking feature works well, especially on hardwood floors or other non-carpeted floors. The kickstand is great for reclining the baby and having them nap.I think this is a better investment than a bouncy chair, especially for babies that could care less about bouncing.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I purchased this rocker for my grandson when he was one month old - he\'s 4 months old now.  And he sits in the rocker almost every day to watch his Baby Einstein videos.  When he has an upset stomach, the vibrations seem to help him work it out!  I had researched different seats before purchasing this one and am 100% happy with it.  I assembled the rocker myself, and didn\'t have any problems understanding the directions.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Our baby (now 4 months) loves to be rocked.  He doesn\'t particularly care for a bouncer or swing but prefers to be rocked.  So we lug his car seat in and out of the car so that we can rock him in it.  I wish I would have known about this.  It seems from all the reviews it would be a waste of money now, he will be sitting up soon.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Our little guy can only lay on his back on the play mat for so long, but loves sitting in this chair. And the toys hanging from the bar are so captivating, he started batting and grabbing at them far earlier than we expected him to. It was so exciting when he started pulling the ring on his own to make the music play - he\'d laugh and we\'d cheer him on. Ahh, the things that thrill us now as parents :-)Also, it seems like the vibration feature is rechargeable (even though I know it\'s not) because I\'ve left the chair on vibrate all night by accident and we still haven\'t needed to change the batteries once since July! That\'s pretty amazing.This is so indispensable in our household, I bought an extra one to send home to Gramma\'s for when we visit!",5

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I have had this toy since my son was born. At first all he did was sit in it and look at the toys. Kinda boring. But it kept him busy as I did the dishes or laundry. Now at 6 months, he sits and plays with the toys. It helps him to sit up, because he wants the toys and to be able to see around more. The toys are fun, and the cow makes music, which he loves. It just gets better. I can still leave him in it while doing other things. It\'s great. I haven\'t had any prblems with it at all.",5

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I am a new mom and actually had no clue as to what infant seat we should get. There are so many. After seeing this one and how long my son would be able to use it my husband and I registered for it. Well my son loves this seat. We can kick back the kick stand and he can recline all the way back so I don\'t feel like he is going to fall out of the seat. At my mothers house we have a different seat. it is a bouncy chair and I constantly feel like he is going to fall out of it because of how high he is, or I feel like he is going to fall out of the sides. I don\'t feel that way in this seat. He just looks sooooo comfortable in it. A must buy for new moms.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My baby girl loves to sit more up-right, so I bought this. She absolutely loves it! She will sit in this for an hour or more sometimes, while I get housework done. She loves the vibration feature. The only thing is that we always forget to turn it off when we take her out of it so the batteries run out pretty fast. She doesn\'t really play with the toys on the bar, they are kind of high up for her to reach. So I just attached other toys that I bought separately and switch them out once in a while so she doest get bored. She will sit in this chair and laugh at the tv. If she falls alseep on me and I want to put her down, I just pull out the stand to make it lean back farther and put her down to sleep in it. She even just recently started falling asleep in it by herself!! We use it every day, multiple times a day! I\'d buy it again in a heartbeat!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This is a sturdy baby seat.  Our granddauther likes to play with the hanging toys, although they fasten with velcro and can be pulled off more easily than others we\'ve had.  This wouldn\'t be a problem except that the baby has a good throwing arm and we can\'t find one of them that was tossed someplace among the other toys.  The back is fairly easily adjustable.  She is nine months old now and gets impatient sitting in it so we don\'t use it as much, but while we did it was very nice.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this rocker for my 1st child - used it from birth and she is now almost 3 years\'old and is still playing in it/with it, brings it everywhere with her, to read a book, to watch TV, to play. From all the gifts, this one is the most used of all, and no matter what age your infant/child is! I remember giving her a bottle in there, and her taking naps, then when she could hold her head, I would feed her there, when she could sit, she was playing with toys, then she started crawling/cruising around it, and climbing in it, ... I think you understand my point! :)... I am now about to have our second child, and I am going to buy another rocker for the new baby, because my daughter #1 won\'t let it go! :).... The only minus: the hanging toys are not that attractive (at least, on the older model) but you just need to hang your baby\'s favorite toys, or rings or whatever your child in interested in and you will both have a great time! :)!....",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This bouncer was an office gift for a coworker.

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair is great!  At first it was a little big for my newborn but he started to like it more and more as he got bigger!  Hes now 14 months old and still uses this chair! He loves to sit in it while he watches cartoons etc. A definate great buy!  When he was a little younger he loved the toybar, but has no use for it now.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Bought this and had it sent to my granddaughter for the baby.  Loves the seat and would recommend it.  My daughter has one that has been used by three babies and theey love to use it as a rocking chair.  They will not outgrow it for a long time.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","First, let me say that this is a great chair. My 8 month old twin girls really enjoy playing with the toys, and they seem pretty comfortable. However, I have to very keep a close eye on them at all times in the chairs when it is in the rocking position. When they sit up in the chair and lean forward, the chair has a tendency to tip over forward. I usually put a blanket under the front of the chair to keep it from tipping. My only other complaint is that the seating harness isn\'t wide enough. It constantly slips to the side leaving my daughters leaning to one side or the other.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I wish I had bought this sooner!  When my 7 month old son started tipping his bouncer seat over, I replaced it with this, and I realized that he could\'ve had it all along.  He loves it, and I have seen him lean all the way forward and the rubber stoppers keep it from tipping over.  I also like that it has the vibrating feature, which he realy liked in his bouncer. It is a great value since I know it will grow with him.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 becasue the toy bar is not quite in the right place.  My son likes to lean past it and ends up bumping his head on the toys instead of playing with them.  It\'s not a big deal,though, because he usually sits in it when he is watching a DVD, or reading(eating)a book.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I love this chair, so my little girl, she is two months old and she loves being sitted there, watching tv or sleeping, also I have a 3 year old nephew who loves it too. this chair is perfect. I recommended.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We like this chair so much that we bought another to leave at my mom\'s when the baby is over there.  It is easy to remove the cover for washing, and the batteries are easily replaced.  My son has used this chair since birth and now uses it for spoon-fed meals (we haven\'t gotten a high chair yet).  He loves the vibrating seat and can now reach the toys.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought the current ""woodland/modern"" design of this rocker this week from Target, after seeing the ""Deluxe"" version of this rocker at my cousin\'s house. My hope was that it would satisfy both the needs of my 2-month-old and my 2-year-old, who sometimes wants to sit in a little kid-sized seat when watching cartoons.Pros: Great print--looks good in my house; Sturdy and easy to put together; vibration feature is quiet and only takes one D battery; easy to use and change from full recline to infant recline to toddler positions.Cons: When assembled, the seat lacks any back support. It seems more ""hammock-like"" than our ancient fisher price bouncy seat, leaving my 13-lb baby a bit scrunched in the seat. Her head was sort of mushing forward, as the rather cheap nylon fabric sagged behind her, leaving her back in a C-shape. Also, the toys on the bar are very hard plastic and don\'t seem very interesting, though again, they are visually a nice design/color.Side note: It\'s a bit too much like a bouncy seat and a bit small to really appeal to my 30-lb toddler. He didn\'t seem interested, other than to put his cars in the seat!End result: Taking this back to Target. Bummer.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This is a great infant seat.  I love that the toys are removable: sometimes my daughter likes them, sometimes she doesn\'t want them there.  It is sturdy and cute.  My daughter loves that she can kick her legs and make it rock.  I have two complaints about it.  1. The vibrator box is loud.  The design is such that it rattles.  It can be rigged up to quiet it, but as is, it is loud and annoying.  2.  Just this design.  I have the elephant friends (blue/green) design and my mom has the bug design for her house.  The bug design is MUCH cuter than the elephant friends design.  I like the seat but the elephant friends toys are ugly.  I know that babies don\'t really care - they just want it to make noise - but I have to look at it too.  The toys on the elephant friends one are removable whereas the ones on the bug one are not but the only advantage I have found in that is that I was able to take down one of the ugly elephants and hang up a different, cuter toy that I bought separately.  Overall, a great seat but I would recommend the bug design.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I got this for little girl when she was about 2 months old- of course, the rocking wasn\'t a feature she used then, but the vibration was a great useable feature.  She would bat at the toys starting around 4 months, and within a couple months could grab the music ring.  I thought around 10-12 months that I would put the chair away, then she suddenly started crawling in and out of it, bringing books and toys with her.  She\'s 2 now, and still loves this chair.  It\'s a great height for her still, as a skinny thing, she\'ll be well within the weight limits for another year or two, and I\'ll probably keep it out for her.  One of the best plus\' for me was that it breaks down so flat.  I\'ve actually taken this with me on a couple of trips- fits in the bottom of a suitcase easily and relatively flat, so easy to pack around.  I had a conference when little girl was 3.5 months that my Mom accompanied me on the trip- it let my Mom get showers in the hotel to keep LG entertained and contained, and then a month or two later, went on vacation, brought it with us- let my husband and I relax a little or cook while she was cooing away in her chair.  I highly recommend- it\'s been a great purchase.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We got this in addition to our regular bouncer seat. It is a nice extra seat and has many position options. Having the vibrating options is great. The rocker slides around on the carpet and isn\'t as easy to keep moving as a regular bouncer, but as an addition to what we have it works. I wouldn\'t want it as our only seat.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Well i thought this was a bouncer.  But it turnes out it wasnt.  I wasn\'t happy at first but than I put my 7 wk old in it and HE LOVES TO ROCK.  He hates his swing so he coos every time i put him in it he also smiles!!!  He also loves the vibrations!!  My 2 yr old also loves to sit in it and play!  So i got something they both can use!,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My mother-in-law purchased these chairs to attempt making caring for twins a bit easier. While the girls would occasionally sit strapped in to play with the dangling toys or watch the TV, they often fought and wiggled to get out. When I attempted to use the kickstand to help with feeding I found that they were laying too flat. Without the kickstand I had to keep a foot on the rocker to hold it in place. Some children may love these, but my girls had no interest in just hanging out in them. I am not even sure that they will use them once old enough to rock as they seem like they would topple easily and a child sits fairly high off of the ground in this.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My son loved this seat as an infant.  The toys captured his attention and he liked the vibration feature.  He used it daily (even napping in it) until he was about 5 months old.  After that he was too wiggly for it.  He uses it now a little bit as a rocking chair but the real use we got out of it was when he was a baby.  Still, for as much as it helped us when he was a baby, it was worth getting!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We love this chair for baby and she seems to like it as well. It is awesome that it is portable and can be moved from room to room, unlike the swing. I was disappointed it cost so much to ship, especially when I found it at the local Walmart for the same price.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My baby (now 9 weeks) has loved this rocker since he came home from the hospital.  I was wondering whether to go with a musical bouncer but with four children in an apartment, I decided to get something that could be used for a while and wouldn\'t need storing.  I am so glad we went with this.  The first toy my baby was really interested in (at a few days) was the cow that hangs on this rocker.  He now smiles and coos at it all the time and it really holds his attention.  The rocker is also very light so I am able to carry it with me from room to room and he enjoys staying near me.  He hates sitting in his car seat, but he seems very comfortable in this and since he spits up a lot, I like having him a little upright. I also switch the toys with other toys I have that have velcro or fabric that will ""hold"" on to the velcro.  My son will play in this happily for a long time and based on my experiences with my other kids, he will probably love having his own little chair when he gets older. Very highly recommended.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Better than bouncer for my 4 month baby, He has a typical bouncer but starts to weight too much for it, then this chair comes to the rescue, when he fall sleep just lift the front tube and make a little bed, is light weight easy to carry to my friends house without problem, easy to clean at washer and dry fast on low heat dryer, nice quality, nice toys, it can be use to feed him or see his favorite tv show (Mickey) maintain my baby safe meanwhile I take a bath or cook with security belt.------Until he was little it was just fine, now my baby has 8 months old, I left him for a second to go for his meal and return to see my baby hanging upside down of the chair still attached to the belt, he was on the floor so thats not a big problem, but I warning you this can happen, its a really great chair, just don\'t left baby alone...",5

He now uses it to sit in while watching TV, even though he\'s getting much too big for it.  His little brother also used it for a while but the oldest didn\'t like that one bit!

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","got this for my New grandson when he visits and it works great, very reasonable price and well made (metal frame), since a lot of things these days are mostly plastic!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",The twins i watch have this chair amoung others and they are 7 months and have started to outgrow the others but they still love this one and fit in it. when they where little they used to sleep in the chair for naps.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I love this rocker for it\'s versatility. We borrowed one from a friend and had to buy our own because we loved it so much. When my baby was new this rocker was her most favorite place - more than the swing, bouncy, etc. Now, at four months, she still loves. I haven\'t gotten to the stage that some users are complaining about so I can\'t say if we\'ll have trouble then, but for now I love it. My favorite part is that my 2.5 year old can also use it. When our son was a baby he ruined the bouncer by bouncing in it like a madman once he got a little older. This seems much more durable and both my kids love it.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I have not been impressed with this product.  The toys are so close to the baby\'s face (baby is 3 months old) they are more of an annoyance that something that he can explore.  We have not found a way to adjust the distance of the toys.  I would not recommend this produce to another parent or grandparent.,3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We got one of these chairs from a friend whose daughter had outgrown it.  It was an older model with no toy bar.  The vibration was starting to wear out so we bought another one.  We have used it every day since our daughter was born and NEVER travel without it.  As for anyone who says their child tipped over, isn\'t it common sense to watch your child at all times?  I have since bought this chair for three baby showers and as a newborn gift.  I can\'t tell you how much we love it.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I was exactly what its described as but not for my son.  I really like the weight limits on it, but it only vibrates and not strong enough to be soothing.",2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Love this chair but the only thing fisher price should do is add a 5 point adjustable harness because my child twice almost flipped over as she was in the curious stage and not yet ready to use it as a toddler rocker but we used it a lot.  Great px and buy.,4

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This rocker chair was easy to put together.  That idea is relative however since I\'ve put together much more difficult things than this.

It looks nice assembled and I have no fears of it falling apart with my daughter in it.I would recommend getting this, if you\'re looking for something beyond the 20/25 pound range for a max weight limit for a child who is not walking yet.My daughter could pulling the handle attached to the flower in the middle of the thing that hangs. She seemed to enjoy pulling it to make the music play.  It got kind of annoying to us though.",4

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I purchased this item to keep at my house for my six week old grandson.  I love the kickstand which allows us to lay it back like a bed.

It doesnt recline as much as iI hoped, and its annoying when the kick stand is up and i need to move it because the rubber makes it impossible. I don\'t see us keeping this til toddler years though.

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I bought this chair for my 2 month old son to use at his grandparents house. It was great! It kept him entertained longer than the bouncy seat we have at home and he would even nap in it when took the activity bar off and put it in the reclined rocker position. He isn\'t old enough to rock forward and tumble out of it like others have said but I will watch him as he uses it as he grows.,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Im really like this rocker is nice and  when my baby is sleeping and try to wake up i just have to rock him and he go back to sleep. even if he is no sleeping if he is awake and try to cry  i just have to rock him and he thinks his on my arms and he calm  down and stay in there happy. i gave 4 stars only because is not very strong. I may have to tight the screws a little more. anyway  i recommend this rocket is wort  the price.,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My son was too big for his moses basket at 4 weeks.  Everyone kept telling me we needed a bouncy chair but at the rate he was growing, I did not want to get something he would quickly grow out of.  This was the perfect answer.  We used it for 1 nap a day for a while and it worked great to put him in it and rock it with my foot while we ate dinner.  As he got older, he liked to bat at the elephants and make the music play.  Now he is 2 and enjoys sitting in it to read to himself.  Some have complained that it tips easily, we never had this problem.  Definitely worth every penny.  I just bought one as a gift and I hope the new mom gets as much use from it as I did.",5

All my friends told me that I needed to get a bouncer for my first child. I did and she hated it. Then I was on amazon and I found this. She loves the Rocking position but I need to keep VERY close eye on her because she likes to stand up in it. For me it was difficult to put together because I had ""help"" from my 16 month old daughter. I love the adorable bug pattern.I am looking forward to the arrival of our second child and boy or girl, I hope they like it.I only gave it 4 stars because it\'s a good product and I like it, But when I look for a 5 star item it must knock my socks off and this didn\'t.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This was a life saver for me. My daughter had colic and this was the only thing I could get her to sit in. She still loves it and I take the toy bar off and feed her in it as well. My 2 yr old son loves to sit in it and with the weight allowance he is able to. I think for the money this can go a long way. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is I think it could have a better seat belt I would never leave the room with her in this now that she is older.,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This is a nice seat and hopefully she\'ll learn to like it again. Some people said the cow faces the wrong way but if you put it in the center the velrco is on both sides. My friend\'s little girl enjoyed rocking in it.,5

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This rocker was a last minute decision and the best one yet. My little one loves the rocking sensation of the chair and the farm animals. It is also very convenient to lay her back and i feel that she is very secure in the seat. We are very happy with the seat .,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair is awesome for any age kids My 3 year old still like to sit in it, so money well spent if it can last that long!!!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Just Right!!! my son will have this for a long time.  Very cute and not too big.  Vibration is at a comfortable level.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Just a word of warning. I ordered this item and today it was left on my door in completley battered condition. While this may sound like a UPS issue, the bottom line is Babies R Us was responsible for preparing the package and said package had no outer boxing, meaning it was pulled from the shelf, a label was stuck on it and it was left to the mercy of UPS. The box had obviously been opened and taped shut, in a very poor manner, at least once. To ship any package in the same form you would pull it off the shelf at a store is pathetically irresponsible and unacceptable. I\'ve arranged for a refund and pick up from UPS to send it back and will just get the item wherever I can find it and put it in the car. I wouldn\'t third party order anything from Babies R Us again and Amazon (who I\'ve ordered probably hundereds of various items from) was made to look bad by representing them. Shame shame shame.",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I have had this seat since my son was born.  It was a life saver, in many ways.  I used it when he was sleepy (by putting the bar to make it more like a bed).  My son sits in it, naps, plays, etc.  But I didn\'t give it all the stars because I want to issue a small warning...when your child gets to be 12 months + watch them when they are in this seat, it can and will flip over.  My son is 13 months now, and I really didn\'t worry too much when he was in his chair because I didn\'t think it could tip.  but he was reaching to get something, and he just reached too far, and the whole chair tipped over on top of him.  He was mostly scared, and so was I.  I just want to let people know that when their child really starts to grab for things further away, keep in mind that this chair can tip.  So I think this is a wonderful chair when they are smaller, but he won\'t be using his anymore because it just isn\'t suited for him.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Our 2 1/2 month old son likes to sit in this seat and stare at the toys, but he doesn\'t care for the vibration like he does in his other bouncer.  This seat is easy to clean, fairly easy to move from room to room, and versatile.  It\'s not that attractive, however.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought one of these chairs for my twin boys to use since they outgrew their bouncer chair. They are 9 months old and crawling and standing. The other day I had strapped one of them into the chair and watched as he dropped a toy to the side of the chair and then proceeded to lean out of the chair to grab the toy.  The whole chair tipped over sideways!  My boy is small and not very heavy.  The chair was not even in the rocker position- it had the &#34;kickstand&#34; out since he is too small for his feet to touch the ground in the rocking position.  Since that time, my child has tipped it over three times and I will no longer put him in it.",2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Our son loves laying in the bouncer. We love the bouncer because we can carry it in any room to keep him occupied while we need both hands for dishes and such. We also like how it can double as a chair and a rocker. We use it as both very often.One con though, what is the deal with the backwards cow head? Mine is located in the middle and is still backwards, I think I am going back to BRU to see about a new one if mine is defective.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This has been a great purchase! Our son (13 mo) uses it throughout the day! It was very easy to assemble! Will recommend to friends!,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This is great for infants and toddlers. My son who will soon be 1 years old did not like it at first because he is securely seated and he learned that there is no way for him to get out. After a couple of times placing him in the seat, he became comfortable and actually sleeps in it. When he rolls from side to side, the seat DOES NOT tip over!!!!!!!!!! This is a great gift for infants in to toddlers!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My daughter\'s daycare has this rocker and she absolutely adores it. She loved it so much that I bought one for at home too. She loves the vibration of Fisher- Price items better than the other companies. She\'s the kind of baby that likes as much motion as possible, so being able to turn on the vibration setting and rock her at the same time is great! I also love that when she\'s older, it will still serve a purpose instead of being outgrown when she\'s around 6 months old. She absolutely adores the rainforest bouncy seat. Fisher- Price has really hit the nail on the head with this one.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this rocker chair because my 6 month old son was wearing out his bouncy seat. He nearly reached the floor weighing in at 17 lbs. this chair also allows me to feed him without having that rocking motion. overall, great buy after bouncy chairs hit the floor!!!!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this rocker as I will soon be baby siting my infant granddaughter.  Very quick delivery.  Pretty easy for me to put together.  Have yet to use it.  Curious , batteries included in the activity bar, but not in the device that makes the whole thing work.  Lesson learned.  I did not read all the information on the rocker, weight, dimensions, etc.  I paid more attention to comments made by purchasers...had I read this was manufactured in China, I would not have bought it.  Therefore, the one star.  Due to this, am sending it back...as soon as I can take it apart and repackage it..",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I HAD REGISTERED AND RECEIVED THE AQUARIUM BOUNCER FROM FISHER PRICE AND HATED IT.  WHEN I SAW THIS ROCKER/BOUNCER I IMMEDIATELY BOUGHT IT.  IT DOESN\'T SAG AFTER 20 LBS, IT IS EASY TO CLEAN AND MY SON WHO IS NOW 1 CRAWLS IN AND OUT OF IT TO WATCH THE WIGGLES!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Our 7 month-old son has gotten lots of use out of his rocker...especially in the first few months when he had reflux and slept better in this than flat on his back...useful during colds too. He has never cared for the vibrations mode, but loves the toys and the rocking. At times I wish it would rock itself! We are very glad we got this RATHER THAN A BOUNCER SEAT, as he was over 20 pounds by 4 months old...and I am all for toys that have lasting value. In light of the comments about babies rocking forward and tipping themselves onto the floor...we will only be using it in rocking mode with close supervision for awhile!",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My baby likes rocking in this rocker, toys keep her entertained, just wished the vibrator was little better like it could rock the rocker instead of just vibrating which baby didnt even realize anything is happening. Color looks great, music is nice, material good, assembly easy.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","pros: metal rocker legs rock very well which i great for us parents who type amazon reviews w/ one hand while rocking a baby in said chair w/ other hand, or even w/ a foot!cons: i can see the rocker being too effective once baby is bigger and pitching himself forward as some parents have mentioned.  Also, toy bar is clumsy to remove when taking baby in and out of chair or getting out of way when baby prefers to watch the world instead of toys. also, not very portable when taking to grandma\'s house.verdict: get the other fisher price newborn to toddler rocker chair.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this item based on previous reviews and I had seen bouncers in action. I wanted somthing I could use for a long time and something that could keep my baby comfortable and occupied. This did that and more. My 3mths old baby rocks to sleep so easily it\'s amazing and we started using it as soon as it arrived nigeria when she was just weeks old! She also loves the arch holding the toys instead of the toys, the red polka dots catches her concentration its so amazing(I have the blue-green).I don\'t regret buying it but I must admit I don\'t like the vibrations (my baby too)so I don\'t use it. Other than that, it\'s a five star.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I had tough time fixing this one. The screw holes are not aligned. I had to give up fixing one of the screw.,3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","The rocker is a good value but it could have been better. Just a couple music tunes would have helped calm cranky infants. Also, the vibration function worked fine for the first few days but then it started making vibration noise after that. It still isn\'t very loud but will disturb you if you are watching tv or trying to sleep.",3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",My daughter loves her rocker and she even falls asleep in the chair. The chair is very comfortable.  The only thing missing are the shoulder straps.  My daughter is very active and like to sit forward in the chair.  Other then that the chair is great,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Excellent,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",The chair is small and not sturdy. Installment is easy but it is shaky. I do not recommend this chair.,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",,4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I used it a lot for my baby\'s naps, when I had to do chores or go to the bathroom, I initially would put him there and swing him, then he started to look at the toys and now he\'s playing with them (6months), so I can have him close enough to give him things after he trows them away meanwhile I can do something :)",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","The product is excellent, has filled all the specifications of the seller, is excellent and  practical, my baby love it,  I like it",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",For my baby not yet to born. Colorful and soft. My baby will like this and sitting and playing the toys.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",My baby love it. He is very like to sit on it and easy to fell sleeping. And it\'s can sit for many years. So I like it too.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",the vibration and rocking effect soothe my baby. she looked happy on it. best buy in amazon. the cushion is soft to touch and fine with baby\'s fragile skin. easy to assemble. definitely worth buying.,5
Badger Basket Clothes Hampers 140 Wood Frame Hamper - Pink Gingham,My husband and I bought this for our baby girls room since it matched her decor and we needed a hamper. When we got it we noticed that we had to re-sew on the velcro that holds the washable cloth on the frame. The cloth is too small for the frame and it easily folds back together.,2
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","It looks great in my baby\'s room and the corner aspect of it is great, I couldn\'t be happier ...",5
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","i wish more companies would make changing tables where you are facing your baby. i had to buy this because i didnt want to change my baby sideways and call me silly, but i didnt want to be banging my elbow into the wall trying to face them with a regular table/dresser. so i bought this. i\'m happy with it so far. its great that it fits snugly into the corner so its a nice space saver in a small nursery. as others have said, the pad is a bit thin but really it serves its purpose. its fine for the amount of time my baby is on there getting their diaper changed. they aren\'t sleeping on it or playing on it for any length of time so it does its job. i\'d recommend to anyone who likes the idea of facing their baby during diaper changes.",4
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural",When we were putting the changing table together we were given two part Cs instead of a part C and part D. Because of this one side of the changing table is missing for now. I went onto the Badger website. Not only are they sending me the part for free they\'re also giving me a 20% off my next order with them. I\'m impressed that they handle their customer service so fast (within an hour of me sending in my complaint). I will continue to buy from them. They have my respect for fixing the problem right away and being very friendly as well.,4
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","I was skeptical about this product after reading other reviews.  I found this changing table to be extremely sturdy, easy to assemble, and a beautiful addition to our nursery.  I chose this changing table over others due to the future possible uses as well as the unique design of fitting into a corner of the room.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a changing table or unique piece of corner furniture.",5
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","Only spent $40 after shipping versus $120 from other places.  For the price, you can\'t go wrong.  It is a middle of the road product, but to avoid going between floors, this serves its purposes well and can be used as a bookshelf when no longer needed as a changing station.",5
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","I read reviews before buying and decided upon this one because of the angle of the baby and the angled sides made me feel more secure that my baby would not fall off.  I have a 2 year old and a 6 month old.  I have been using this table for 6 months and it has held up great.  My 2 year old is over 30 lb. and he fits on it. I found baskets that fit the 2 middle shelves PERFECTLY!!!!  They are the Seagrass V-Weave Basket (LARGE) from World Market.  I can get 2 weeks worth of diapers and wipes for both my kids in one basket and the other one I put blanket, rags, and clothes I need on hand.  Love this table, just wish I would of bought it when my first child was born.",5
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","I asked for this table at my shower. I selected it because it is a real space saver and that it had plenty of room for storage. It seemed to make sense to have the baby butt facing me. As a first time mom I wasn\'t sure what to expect. This table is a dream. I couldn\'t imagine changing my baby any other way. Not only do I have a good view of his bottom, but we get to have one on one time face to face. My baby is 4 months old now, and everyday I use this table I love it even more. The table it have some minor factory imperfections but for the price I had no issues with them. I strongly recommend this for first time moms.",5
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","We bought this based on shape and reviews. We use it for an 18 month old and newborn, and it\'s great for both. The shape fits into corners and gives you an easier angle to do the \'job\'. The shelves are convenient for storing and keeping handy all diaper and clothing changing equipment, even though some will complain they are thin, flimsy boards- we are taking about diapers, not a garage for cars.The shape makes for a very stable table, and the mat fits on nicely- although the screws to attach it to the table are not too lasting. But then again, where would the mat run?All in all a great changing table, with the only change I would make would be to enclose the storage shelves so the older children wouldn\'t have a field day undoing all your organizing.",5
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural",The table itself is great...sturdy and matches all the other furniture we bought.  The changing pad is not the best and has torn thru the screw down mechanism to keep it in place.  There is a lot of storage room for diapers and other essentials which I love.  Now that my son is 8 months old I still use it to change his diapers (his feet hang off the edge though) but the bottom has become a bookshelf which is great.  I also like how my son faces me instead of laying sideways while I change his diaper (however I have been peed on...lol).  If there was a better pad and cover to go with this I would have given it 5 stars.,4
Wood Frame Hamper with Blue Gingham,"I finally found the perfect hamper for my son\'s blue and white nursery. The gingham print is subtle and there is a pretty white ribbon edging on the flap cover, an unexpected but nice detail. The hamper is lightweight, easy to fold and has a drop-in mesh bag so that laundry can be removed without having to move the hamper itself.  It is not a hamper meant for heavy duty laundry but is perfect for an infant\'s/child\'s wash.",4
Wood Frame Hamper with Blue Gingham,Hamper is just what I expected. A nice little surprise is that it came with a inside bag that you can easily remove and take to the washer and dryer.,4
Sassy Flower Pop Up Organizer,This was purchased as a clothes bin for my kids\' room. it is so pretty that it looks like a decoration. It doubles as a toy basket as well. It has so many good uses. It is way more stylish that the usual white baskets.,5
Sassy Flower Pop Up Organizer,This was an ideal gift for our Grandaughter. It can be useful for a number of things. Highly recommended instead of toys,4
Sassy Flower Pop Up Organizer,one of the best toy storages i have ever had. Very compact and spacious! I\'m going to order at least one more.,5
Sassy Flower Pop Up Organizer,"I wanted this for my little girl\'s room, it\'s smaller than I expected (my fault, I should have paid more attention to the dimensions). It\'s also not as vibrant as I was expecting it to be, but still nice enough. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a laundry basket or toy basket for their kid\'s room.",4
Sassy Flower Pop Up Organizer,This product really met my expectations. I ordered it for my 3 year old for christmas and we filled it with dress up clothes. Very durable! Our kids climb all over it.,5
"Sassy Baby Flower Tote, Multiple Colors","I love this little storage cube - it doesn\'t take up a lot of space and it\'s great for storing toys and books that are easy for a little one to access, and it can be folded away and stored when not in use.My only complaint is that I wish the little built-in supports in the edges were stronger - while reaching into the tote for a toy my daughter leaned a little too hard I guess and one of the plastic rods snapped and broke.  There is no risk of injury - the plastic is completely enclosed in the fabric, however now the tote doesn\'t stay upright very well if it\'s not full of something, it droops on one side.",3
Baby Einstein Musical Pop-Up Pals,"My son loves the Baby Einstein video tapes, so we had to show him this toy when we saw it at the store.  He was delighted in playing with it for about 5-10 minutes when suddenly his little finger got stuck in one of the holes (where the characters pop up and down).  He screamed and could not get his finger out.  I had trouble getting his finger out also because the character was wedged against his finger.  This toy is not safe.  It should be redesigned.",1
Baby Einstein Musical Pop-Up Pals,"I usually love Baby Einstein products, but I don\'t love this one.  It\'s very poorly designed.  The buttons are too hard for little hands, even my 1 year old has a hard time with them.  The toy itself is too small, the sounds don\'t work correctly half the time, and it has too many sharp edges.  Don\'t waste your money.",1
Baby Einstein Musical Pop-Up Pals,"I have never written a review before but had to because this toy is the worst toy we\'ve had.  The animals do not pop up when the buttons are pushed, which defeats the purpose of this toy.  It requires batteries to play horribly annoying sounds & music.  I threw it in the trash & bought a fisher-price instead, it works properly & doesn\'t require batteries.",1
Baby Einstein Musical Pop-Up Pals,"My son is almost 7 months old and we tried this in the store. He has a Sesame Street pop-up toy that he absolutely loves, but even though he can close them by himself, he has a very hard time manipulating the levers to open them. I was hoping to find one that was better suited to his little hands. This toy is the complete opposite of what I was looking for. This was just as hard if not harder than the Sesame Street to work, and he just didn\'t care for it anyway. I found the Fisher Price Bobble & Giggle Pals for less money and he LOVES it. The levers are just the right sensitivity for him, not too sensitive, not too hard. The animals play different sounds each time they are opened and even play music. I highly recommended the Fisher Price one over this. It isn\'t here on Amazon, but I\'ve seen them at Walmart, Target and Toys R\' Us stores.",1
"Sassy Baby Ocean Tote, Multiple Colors",Wonderful toy box for toddlers.  No sharp corners to fall on and just the right height.,5
Tiny Steps 2-in-1 Walker-Fantasia,"This is the second walker that I purchased for my son.  First of all, he is a big boy and the other walker did not adjust high enough for his height.  Also, the other walker did not seem to encourage him to walk forward.  All he would do in the other walker is walk backward.It seems that this walker had toys that encouraged him to lean over a little thus pushing him forward and he realized that he could move forward!!  Also, the height is great and the toys are really cute on the walker.  The music is pleasant to listen to also.I would recommend this to anyone!",5
Tiny Steps 2-in-1 Walker-Fantasia,"My son loved the music and lights in this walker, but it was impossible for him to walk in it on carpet, and even on the hard floor it was hard for him, impossible to steer it the way he wanted to because the wheels get stuck one way when he wanted to go the other way. We only used it like an exersaucer/activity center, which we already had, so it was sort of pointless.",3
Tiny Steps 2-in-1 Walker-Fantasia,"Note: I think I have a slightly older model than the one listed here because it doesn\'t bounce.  However, that hasn\'t been an issue for us as our daughter seems to love her Tiny Steps just the way it is.We received a used Tiny Steps walker as a gift, and I decided to leave it at my mother\'s house so my almost 4-month-old daughter would have an upright entertainer to use during visits.  At home, we have both a jumperoo and an exersaucer, and she will stay in those for maybe 5-10 minutes at the most before fussing to come out.  (She seems to become fairly easily overwhelmed with lots of flashing lights and electronic sounds.)  I figured the same would be true of the Tiny Steps, but boy, was I wrong!The first time I put her in the Tiny Steps (with the brakes on), she was delighted.  Even with the music playing and the lights flashing on the Mini Maestro, she didn\'t become overwhelmed and would have happily stayed in as long as I was willing to allow it.  Right now, we\'re only using it as a stationary entertainer with the brakes on; soon, though, once she becomes a bit stronger and more coordinated, we\'ll release the brakes and let her move around the house in it (under CLOSE supervision to prevent accidents).  It doesn\'t seem to move as easily on rugs as on tile or hardwood floors, so it takes a bit more effort on the child\'s part to move the Tiny Steps over carpet.I must say that one of the things I like best about the Mini Maestro toy on the Tiny Steps is the way it has both electronic elements (electronic music, flashing lights) as well as ""analog"" elements (a steering wheel that makes a non-electronic ""clack-clack"" sound when turned, a horn that gives a non-electronic ""honk"" when pushed).  Call me old-fashioned, but I\'m not a fan of having everything be electronic, and I was delighted to see that my daughter\'s favorite thing to do so far with the Mini Maestro is turn the steering wheel to hear the clack-clack sound.Overall, while this toy doesn\'t have the kinds of bells and whistles of many of the exersaucers and other entertainers out there, I think that especially for a younger child it does an excellent job of capturing attention without being too overwhelming.  The fact that the Mini Maestro can be removed for use as a separate toy and that the Tiny Steps converts into a walk-behind toy for toddlers only adds to its versatility and value.",5
Sassy Water Pop Up Organizer,nice product looks just like picture simple way to organize your kids toys in one container I really like that this one has a zipper.,5
Sassy Water Pop Up Organizer,"I ordered a group of these storage devices for my daughterfor my grandkids toys or clothes.  This is lightweight,washable with a cloth, fairly large so it can hold a lotof clothing or toys.  Children can tip it over and notbe hurt, or crawl in it.  It can be crushed down flat.It arrived in a timely manner, in excellent condition,",5
Sassy Water Pop Up Organizer,this product is great! it is bigger than i thought so we can fit so many toys in there. its full of color so my boy was excited when he saw it and it kinda motivated him to put his toys away in it. the only drawback is that the zipper doesnt open all the way around it only goes halfway through the circle but its not too much of a bother. i would really recommend this!,4
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"I bought this when my son was about a month old (he is 7 mos. old now) and wish I\'d discovered it sooner.  My baby is a very happy baby, but would sometimes get fussy/bored when shopping and running errands.  This was a life saver.  We were able to run around for hours.  Some notes after having used it for several months:- It has a couple of settings... you can have music and the mobile, or mute it and have just the mobile.  I wish it had an option for just the music and no mobile because we don\'t need to waste the batteries running the mobile after he falls asleep, but we still want the music to play.  That being said, the batteries last forever.  We used it a LOT and I only had to change the batteries twice.- I really like that the mobile blades are reversible.  It has mostly black and white images on one side for when they are younger, and it has little stuffed animals that dangle for when they are older.  There are velcro strips on the stuffed animal side to secure the stuffed animals when the blades are turned with the black and white side down, which is nice.  However, when you turn the blades so the stuffed animal side is down, the little animals swing around and they tend to get stuck on the velcro, which is pretty annoying.  You can fix this by buying some velcro strips and using the ""other side"" of the velcro strip to cover it, or you can just put a piece of tape over the velcro to keep the animals from sticking.- The mobile does rattle/vibrate a bit when you are in the car... there really isn\'t anything that can be done to alleviate that, as it does have moving parts.  It\'s not a fault in the product, just an observation.- Some reviews say the clip makes it hang down too far, and I totally agree... if you are using it on an infant car seat/carrier, you want to use the elastic band that velcros around the carrying handle of the carrier.  I believe the clip is meant for use on a stroller.I have recommended this product to many of my friends who are expecting, as it was a ""can\'t live without it"" purchase.  Two of my other ""can\'t live without it"" items are the Itzbeen Baby Care TimerItzbeen Baby Care Timer - Blue, and the Aden & Anais muslin blankets (which are fabulous if you live in a warm climate or have a summer baby)Aden + Anais 100% Cotton Muslin Swaddle Wrap, Jungle Jam, 4 Pack.",5
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"i never write reviews but my baby sleeps in the car seat at nite and is in it a lot at the babysitter so i needed something to keep him entertained.  this does it!! it fits beautifully to my Graco snugride car seat.  i take off the clip, take off the velcro and then revelcro it around the handle - it takes practice but it works and fits great!!!  it never falls off.  my baby is now 12 weeks and i have it for at least 7 weeks.  its great for newborns b/c its has black, white and red on one side and when they get a little older you flip the little pieces and pull the animal down.  u can also have it just go around without noise.  my baby loves the music so i never use that feature and i havent had to replace the batteries once yet.  everyone who seems me with it tells me they want it too! the smartest thing for the car seat!",5
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,i like this mobile i bought this for my son he is over the 3 months old now .he likes it too he looking at it alot in his carseat  when we going to anywhere ..and he likes music sound alot too .b/c when he listening that melody sound he fell a sleep right by then .i love this but this is il bit heavy anyway we like this alot,4
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"When my baby was in the first few month of life, she would cry every time we tried to take her anywhere. She didn\'t want to be in her car seat or the car at all. But I knew she enjoyed watching things move. So I looked and looked and finally came across this mobile. She absolutely loved it. I never used the clip, instead just used the velcro and it worked great. We didn\'t even use the music, she just liked to watch it spin. We have taken it with us even on the plane. It comes off easily and goes right back on without any issues. We used it for many months till we had to get a new car seat that doesn\'t have a bar to hang it on so now it is hanging in her room. We have owned it for about 7 months now and it still works great and our daughter still loves it as well. I plan to buy this as baby gifts in the future.",5
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"Used this for both my babies and each one responded to this toy like no other. When they were only a few weeks old and didnt pay attention to much at all, this was the only thing that got them smiling and excited.Recommended this to tons of friends as well and was a hit with everyone.Contrary to some neg comments, the clip is very very strong and has always hung on our stroller canopy with no issues",5
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,My son really likes this but it is so heavy that I won\'t put it on his car seat while driving. So I clip it on his play mat.,4
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"Bought this and almost returned it once I saw it in person.  It looks like the simplest, dinkiest (although well constructed) thing.  And then the music is this tinkly classical loop of about 4 classical songs.  I opened it up, turned it on, and my 5 week old baby lit up.  He LOVES the quality of the music.  I don\'t know which frequencies babies hear differently, but apparently Tiny Love does.  He likes this more than his real mobile in his crib.PLUSES: hangs anyhwere - velcro was very strong in my opinion, has a clamp in addition to velcro strap, and most importantly DOESN\'T TURN OFF UNTIL YOU TELL IT TO!  This is great.  Most mobiles require you to keep coming back and turning them on. It\'s so great that my only MINUS: wish it had a way to turn off the mobile function and just use it as a music box.  My method of doing this is that I turn it upside down and put it somewhere with enough room and just let it play in the baby\'s room as a never-ending music box.You might not be impressed, but your baby will like it if he/she\'s at all like my baby.",4
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"This is a fabulous invention. I give it to all of my friends who have babies. Several friends who have multiple children, four or more, have commented that they thought they had everything until it arrived in the mail. Their only wish is that they knew about it when they had their first child. My son loved it. We would use it when we traveled to clip on the pack-n-play or crib. It is very durable, we inherited ours from my nephew. It will last through many children, even when my son was able to hold on to the little animals while I was driving the mobile never broke. Cannot highly recommend this enough.",5
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,I like this clip and go mobile for using in the car seat or the stroller but the music is really soft and the mobile is heavy so can bump into the baby if the terrain is rough.,4
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"My son loves this mobile. I bought this mobile when my second son was born and have used it ever since. I like that I can clip it on his carrier, on his stroller, or on his crib. You have to remove the clip to make it work on a carrier or it will be in the baby\'s face, but that is not difficult. It can be a little loud so it doesn\'t work well for the nighttime, but when baby is awake it works well. He loves the little bugs and the music is nice. You can ignore the sound of the motor if you concentrate on other things, but it can become annoying if you have to listen to it for a really long time. It makes car rides a lot easier so I can take the noise. Anything is better than screaming. i wish that I had this with my first son. The price is really great for the product and the batteries last for a while.",5
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"I love this.  It has a clip to hang it from a stroller, but for my car seat I just removed the large orange clip and it is the perfect height.  I use the lithium batteries and they seem to last the best.",5
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"My daughter and I both love this toy - she loves the music and the ""0-3 month"" side of the mobile ""paddles,"" or arms (the flat ones with stickers).  I love the music as it is all classical, and a fair representation of the actual music (only Chopin gets a little ""tinny"" on a few notes, but nothing I cannot live with).Other favorite elements include:  1)it plays continuously (I hate musical toys that turn off after a preset period of time - so annoying), 2)it has a ""mute"" setting, for movement without sound (great for restaurants and bookstores) and 3) it comes with the ""lobster"" claw attachment, which is removable from this mobile, and useable to attach a multitude of other toys to just about anything (I totally disagree with the reviewer who said they could not attach this to virtually anything - I can attach it to virtually *everything*...I use this all over, with multiple toys from multiple brands.  It was most useful in attaching everything to the hood of a bassinette).I like that one can attach the mobile via the lobster claw OR the velcro-ed elastic strap:  very versatile for a multitude of objects.  It is a perfect size for travel:  not too small, and not too large.My daughter ADORES this mobile.  She would stare at it contentedly for parent-friendly blocks of time (from 3-5 mo. or so) in the bassinette.  She never liked the older-child, soft plush figures as much as the flat, 2D, images in black/white/red (even after she could see color, and 3D).  She loves the music even now at 8 months, so it\'s not a big deal, but Tiny Love (TL) could improve the color contrast or interest of the plush ""guys.""  She and I also liked that the plush figures stick w/ velcro to the three rotating paddles, but can also be pulled down to dangle via the attached string below the paddles for added movement/interest (they don\'t come off completely).  Three different viewing modes for the price of one.I gave it four stars due to the so-so interest on the plush toy side.In general (not affecting my review of the mobile), TL should include this ""lobster"" claw attachment clip with all sold-separately accessories such as the Baby\'s First Wind Chimes - Garden.  I highly recommend both this mobile and the chimes as a perfect pair for months 3-5...and beyond.",4
Tiny Love Musical Take Along Arch - Ocean,"I bought this to clip onto our sons carseat for the road trips we take so that he would have something to look at.  First of all it wasnt green and blue like it said, it was pink purple and yellow.  The arch would not stay clipped on and the tiniest bump would send it flying into our sons face.  The turtle ""sings"" which is cute but it plays the same 10 second clip every time it hardly swings which can get annoying after a 9 hour trip!  The only good thing was that my son really liked the toys hanging from it and we were able to take them off the arch and hang them onto his carseat with some colored rings that we got from Walmart.  Overall we were really disappointed with this.",2
Tiny Love Musical Take Along Arch - Ocean,"This is the only thing my son will coo and smile at on his carseat!  It hooked just fine to my infant seat.  The musical crab plays music when you shake it.  Even going over a bump in the road will activate it.  When it plays, my son will smile at it.  I love this toy.  It makes riding in the car enjoyable.",5
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I bought this bag before finding out what the sex of our baby is.  I have two boys already, I decided that even if we have another boy, I wanted this bag for me.  My husband (he didn\'t see it before I bought it) liked it too and said he will carry it if we have a girl.  I was shocked at that!  It\'s such a cute bag!  Finally having a baby doesn\'t mean that you have to carry a Winnie-the-Pooh, cheesy diaper bag!",5
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I hope you read this.  I saw another kid of diaper bag on BabyUniverse.com.  They have 3 different kids in camo.  Blue camo, green camo, and grey camo.  They are different bags but look nice.  My husband is also in the military.  I just ordered this bag and can\'t wait to get it.  I have a girl and I love this pattern and all of the compartments.",5
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I fell in love w/ this bag- it\'s girlie but not froofie, and good a space for my stuff. Well, it doesn\'t hold much. I can get my wallet and cell, 3 diapers, travel wipes and 2 bottles. I cant fit an extra outfit, blanket, extra bottles, or toys to entertain her. I took it on a trip for the plane and had to bring another bag for my daughters stuff- bottles, outfit and blanket. I am so disappointed, since I use both of the free diaper bags I got from the hospital more than this one. And my husband was not thrilled with how much I spent on this, but I figured it would be my ""purse"" for 2-3 years.",2
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I dont know what anyone is talking about, this bag is huge. My only prob. is I wish it was smaller. Nice organization.",4
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I absolutely love this diaper bag.  When I first saw it, I fell in love with it.  It works so well.  I seem to feel the need to carry everything with me and this diaper bag allows me to do that.  It is very durable and fashionable at the same time.  I would recommend this diaperbag to anyone.  It is definately worth the money.",5
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I love this bag. I live in Canada and cannot find anything like it here. My husband bought it in the U.S. I went with it based on the look of the bag and the customer reviews. I love it. I find it roomy, love the three separate compartments as well as the outside pockets and the look of it. I disagree with those that say it is not roomy enough. I can get toys, a change of clothes for my 6 month old, my wallet, cell, water bottle, diapers, snacks for my older child and me etc in this bag. I get many compliments on it as it does not look like the standard, ""diaper bag"".",5

"Luvable Friends Thermal Knit Receiving Blanket, White","The blanket was advertised as 100% cotton. The packaging has conflicting information, though. The front of the package states it is &#34;100% cotton.&#34; The back of the package lists fabric content as &#34;60% cotton, 40% polyester.&#34;  Which is it??

Fitted Pack N Play Sheet in Traditional Blue Print,"This is such a great deal! Sheet is good quality. Not too thin and very soft. I was unsure if this would work with just the mat that my pack and play came with. Sure enough it fits just fine. I had a blanket down before I got this but the blanket ended up over my 7 month olds head. This fits perfectly. It is very snug, so I know it wont budge. But now I understand why people buy the pack and play mattresses. The little mat doesnt have much padding.",5

Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"Do not purchase this item!I washed it 3 times and my baby smells like it has been treated with toxic chemicals!

Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"These sheets go GREAT with the Davinci Crescent 50-Coil Mattress! I had a heck of a time finding sheets that would fit and not cost an arm and a leg. These Luvable Friends sheets are PERFECT and super soft!!! They are not heavy duty, but will definitely do the job. So far I am really happy with my purchase - just wish they had more designs in this size to choose from. I went with basic pink. :)",4

Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,I\'ve been looking for portable sheets that will fit oversize mattresses.  I have a day care center and I am always in need of replacing portacrib/mini crib sheets.  I have tried several different brands of sheets & this is the only sheet that I\'ve found that is affordable and that fits the 3 inch mattresses along with the 6 inch mattresses.,5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"After reading all of the product reviews, I decided to give this a try. So far, he so good. The sheets shrank to the perfect size for the 6&#34; mini crib mattress after one wash. We\'ll see how to holds up after multiple washes.",5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,It fits the 6 inch portable crib mattress perfectly but it is not top quality sheets. After a few washes it will shrink.,3
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,this is just so SOFT... it is perfect! I admired their softness for 5 minutes once i got them.. couldn\'t believe how great this material is!!,5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,The sheet was flimsy and did not fit properly on mattress.They said the sheets were really soft mine are not soft.This product is not what was advertised.,3
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"These sheets aren\'t the highest quality (i.e. thickness), but I\'m not looking for something pricey that my baby will just poop and pee on anyway.  They are soft, and unlike the American Baby Company jersey sheets they actually fit over both my mini-crib mattress and mattress pad even after washed/dried.",4
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"Great fit for Da Vinci Mini crib 5 in mattress. Soft cotton, will probably get a couple more in the future.",5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,This is the only sheet I have found that fits my traditional DaVinci Crescent Mini Crib 50 coil mattress.It\'s thin but fits perfectly. I highly recommend buying a few.,4
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,I ordered this fitted sheet for my mini crib. Read other reviews that suggest American Baby brand. However I am so glad I chose to go with Luvable friends instead. They are 100% cotton and The sheets are so soft and nice!  The deep pockets fit the 5&#34; deep mattress perfectly without having to worry about it slipping off. Absolutely love it! Definitely will order more.,5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,This was a perfect fit for the Dream On Me5 Portable Crib Mattress...beautiful soft pink shade...soft material that\'s not harsh on a baby\'s skin.,5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"Good fit for our 5 inch deep mini crib mattress.  Soft and stretchy sheets.  We go longer between washings by using waterproof flannel lap pads (there\'s some kind of waterproof layer in the middle), or the larger flannel pads under our twins\' heads and bottoms to help catch leaks and spit-ups.  I also use these on the really thin 1&#34; mattress (more like a pad) that came with my mini crib.  That pad, covered with one of these sheets, is perfect for carrying wherever, setting on the floor, and putting one or both babies on it for tummy time or for a nap on their backs.",5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"The good news is it fits the deep mini crib mattress that other sheets have trouble stretching all the way around.  The bad news is it had a worn, threadbare spot right in the middle of the sheet.  A manufacturing defect, but the only resolution was to send back for a refund, no exchange, no just send me another one. I didn\'t feel like going through the whole process for $10, so I\'m just using it.  I guess I will sew the spot up when the hole starts showing",3
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"I bought three of these for my Emily crib and have been using them for several months with no problem.  They wash well and are still soft, even though I don\'t use fabric softener of any sort.  I might mention two other things.  First, I am using them with the six inch innerspring mattress, which is not the 1.5&#34; mat that comes with the crib.  Also, I remember that when I first ordered, I saw that some patterns and colors cost more than others, even from the same vendor, so I ordered accordingly.",5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"I bought this sheet, along with a few others for my daughter\'s 3 inch mini crib mattress.  All 3 sheets fit with fabric to spare, but after a few washes, there was a little shrinking.  All of my sheets still fit my 3 inch mattress just fine, but if I\'d had a 5 inch mattress, I don\'t know that they would still work.  Still, for my needs this sheet does the trick and I\'m very happy with the product.",4
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"These sheets fit my Crescent minicrib mattress fine, but they are not durable.  After just 2 washes, they developed a small hole in them and appear worn. Perhaps they would have held up better on a gentle wash cycle, but my baby spit up lot and I needed to clean the sheets well.",3
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,fit very nicely.  I was nervous since the crib is smaller than a regular size crib but it fit just fine.,5
Stock Car Bed &amp; Storage Chest Set,"I experienced shipping problems and decided to order directly from the manufacturer, Step2, at an extremely lower rate.  I have contaced Amazon about the outrageous shipping costs on more than one occasion and wish they would investigate ways to lower it.  I think they\'re losing business over this.  Unfortunately,  our local Toys R Us does not place personal orders for customer pick up at their location so we weren\'t able to get the bed that way either.",1
Sassy Baby\'s Bucket of Beads,"I ordered the ""Sassy Baby\'s Bucket of Beads"" because my sister had them for her babies and they loved them. They are scented, come in a nice little plastic jar with a screw on lid. I have seen two types of beads from this manufacturer, and specifically chose this one because I\'d read the other bucket of beads were hard plastic, as opposed to the softer, scented beads which come in the nice little bucket (Which for the babies is every bit as much fun as the beads themselves). After looking at the picture provided, the description and shopping around for the best price I ordered from Amazon. I got them in a timely fashion, but I was sorely disappointed to open up a cheap, flimsy, plastic container with a taped on plastic top, filled with 18 hard plastic beads. The trouble it would take to return them, wait until the problem was fixed and have the right ones redelivered just wasn\'t worth it. She would probably outgrow them by then! Not so thrilled.",3
Sassy Talk and Touch Barn Activity Center,"I bought this toy for my 12 month old little boy and am very pleased. Each lever, button etc. opens a door to show a different farm animal. The pleasant voice tells him the name of the animal and something about it. The buttons/levers are not difficult to manipulate at all for his age range. His cousins who are 10 months and 2 years both love it as well and have no difficulty playing with it without assistance. I would recommend this toy to anyone. Also, the price is refreshing when you are used to paying much more for other brands with similar features. Hint... price has a wide range so shop around. I bought it for much cheaper in a store.",5
Sassy Talk and Touch Barn Activity Center,"I got this toy when my daughter was about 11 or 12 months old. I have to say that she absolutley loves this toy then and now. The problem is that there are a couple buttons that trip her up. There\'s a toggle to flip for a horse and a lever to pull down for a cow and they\'re extremely hard to push over and pull down. She always gets frustrated when trying to do these two animal\'s levers and I end up having to help her. She\'s now 19 months old and still is having problems with the horse lever and can just barely get the cow lever down half the time. And I\'d like to make it known that she\'s not a weak child! Still, she likes this toy. Just don\'t expect a 9 month old to pull all the toggles themselves. This maker should\'ve made these easier to manipulate. Or maybe I just got a defective one:-) I\'d be my luck.",3
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"I am so excited that I received this diaper bag for my shower.  For months it has been out of stock.  But it is well worth the wait.  I have received numerous high end diaper bags and this one beats them all.  Do not be put off by the reviews saying it is too heavy.  It isn\'t the bag that is heavy it is all the stuff we need to carry around that makes it that way.  But what is awesome is that the straps are designed so well that they don\'t dig into your shoulders or anything.  I have received so many compliments on what a great looking bag it is.  And I just love to show off my hot mama pocket because who wants to carry around a purse and a diaper bag at the same time?  Not me!  This is the only bag you will need.  Now my husband had to get his own ""manly"" bag, he didn\'t want to walk around carrying this one. But truly out of the numerous diaper bags I have tried, this is the best!",5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"My girlfriends and I purchased this tote and stuffed it with other baby shower gifts for our friend Julie.  She loves the bag.  It\'s so stylish and soft to the touch, and big enough to carry everything the new bundle of joy will need during the course of her daily travel.  The rich chocolate brown color with the perfect touch of pink will keep her husband from feeling awkward when he\'s carrying this beautiful diaper duffle.  The touch of pink lets everyone know that it\'s a girl ruleing daddy\'s world.",5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"If there is such thing for love at first sight for a diaper bag,then I have fallen hard....I just saw this bag at BRU and couldn\'t believe how gorgeous this was.I have a 21 month old but we\'re trying for #2 and I knew I had to have this for when my hands are really full.I left the store & read about it on the website.It seems there is sometimes a wait for this, so I went back right away & bought one!Besides being such a fabulous design and color, it is SO roomy and will hold much more than a regular diaper bag.I have one I bought when I had my little girl and it harly fits enough and it\'s pretty big too. But this one is ROOMY and has a place for EVERYTHING and then some.There won\'t be a need to carry a purse either when you have this.This is a little more than most diaper bags, but this a spurge I would not pass up.This even gives my high end bags a run for there money, move over gucci & louis... there\'s a new bag in town!!  :)",5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,great bag.  I love it - the only thing missing is some type of thermo-compartment for keeping bottles/sippys cold.,4
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"Not only is this a super cute looking bag but it is extremely functional.  It has tons of compartments of different sizes for just about everything you will need.  I am a new mother so I have been over packing for every outing but luckily everything fits in this bag.  Some people have stated that the bag is too heavy... maybe if you are 4\'10, otherwise it is simply perfect.  I get tons of compliments every time we are out!!",5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"I registered for and received this bag prior to the birth of my first child.  I thought it was awesome -- stylish and super functional with all of the labeled compartments.  Everyone gushed over it at the shower, and since then I\'ve received numerous compliments on how nice it is.Well, it\'s a pretty bag, but that\'s about it.  Like others, I have found that once you put things into the compartments, there\'s never room for blankets, burp cloths, etc.  And let\'s get real here.  When you are in a rush and need to run out the door, you don\'t have time to put things in their place (at least I don\'t anyway).  So, I\'m constantly digging around trying to find things.  There are so many compartments that I feel like I lose things in the bag all the time.And the handles.  I know it\'s a personal preference, but if I ever buy a new bag, I will get a messenger style that goes across my body.  My son likes to be carried and I can never manage him with the bag constantly slipping off my shoulder.My advice to anyone shopping for a bag is to be realistic and purchase what will be the most practical, regardless of a bag\'s appearance/style.",3
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"This is a really pretty bag and it is large enough to hold everything for both mommy and baby... I ordered it after reading the reviews posted.  I wish I would have listened to those who had reservations about the bag.  My one and only reason for returning it is because once filled, this bag gets very heavy.  To lug this around (does not have a shoulder strap to throw over stroller bar) all day long with a toddler, is just too much.  I returned this and bought the Pink Camouflage Messenger Bag by Wendy Bellissimo instead... Its just as beautiful and has a ton of room for everyone\'s stuff, but it also has a shoulder strap so that you can hang it on your stroller when you are out and about.",1
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,I have gotten so many compliments on this Diaper Bag. I love using it.,5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"I did an extensive internet and store search for a nice, un-diaper-bag-looking, diaper bag.  I\'d been carrying a big black diaper bag, which we\'d also bought at Babies R Us, but I also ended up bringing my purse (the bag wasn\'t as practical to carry my personal items as I\'d thought).  So I searched high and low for a nice, practical bag, that also fit my personal style.  I had already bought a friend of mine the blue denim messenger bag and so I took a look at the other Wendy Bellissimo bags and chose this one.  Ordered it on Thursday and received it the next day. Love it!  Best of both worlds (diaper bag & purse in one)!Would love to see Wendy come out with some more bags and other baby & mom stuff.",5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"My son just turned one, and yes, I am now only experiencing the great joy of ""the perfect bag""! I had been using the black bag the hospital gave us when leaving the hospital. It served its purpose, but I definitely felt the need to get a new, more spacious (and of course, stylish) bag. I searched high and low, only to find those falling into the boring or overpriced category. Then one day when picking up a few things at Babies R Us, I happened upon this bag and stopped dead in my tracks. I LOVED it!! But, admittedly, when seeing the price, I waivered on it. Should I or shouldn\'t I? I must have held it for 15 minutes... and with a shrug of my shoulders, put it back. ""I\'ll think about it"", I said. Months passed and after even more unsuccessful searches, I decided, ""that\'s it, I\'m buying it!"".  Very excited, with credit card in hand, I jumped online only to find that this bag was SOLD OUT everywhere and that there was a waiting list the size of I don\'t even know what. I couldn\'t believe it! Again, I would have to wait...My sister was shopping at Babies R Us the other day, saw it, called me, and within minutes I was there, in line and out the door... with my beautiful new bag! It\'s been about 2 weeks that I have been using it and I AM IN LOVE!!!Do not hesitate! The price my seem high at first, but really, it\'s a beautifuly, incredibly function, high quality bag. It holds all the necessities - for the both of us. I am no longer juggling multiple bags - a diaper bag for him and a purse for myself. Initially I was concerned that there was not a shoulder strap option, but it\'s not an issue. It fits so comfortably over my shoulder and nestles right under my arm... it doesn\'t slide - at all! And, most of all, this bag is all glam... it\'s gorgeous, feminine... a real looker! You\'ve got to get it :)One final word if you\'re on the fence. If you hate heavy bags, this is probably not the one for you. When filled to capacity, it does get a bit heavy, BUT (yes, there is a but) it\'s nothing you can\'t handle. I still give this bag 5-Stars... it\'s amazing!!!!Alas, my search is over... thank you Wendy!!!",5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"This bag IS very hard to find, but that is because it is sooooo nice and really really functional.  The first time I saw it, a lady had picked it up and it was the last one so she bought it, I called every babies r us in FL, an no one had it...So I called a store in Tennessee and they had one left they let me pay for it over the phone and would have shipped it (but I had my aunt pick it up for me).  It is aggrivating that it is so hard to find, but if it wasn\'t, everyone would have it =)  I am SUPER picky about purses and diaper bags, and this is the only one I wanted....so if you just call around I""m sure some store will have it.  Good Luck, it is worth it!!  And I dont know what these people are saying it is heavy for, it\'s no heavier than any other diaper bag I\'ve tried.  Also, it\'s not fair for the people to be giving it a low rating just because they can\'t find it.",5
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,This bag is very stylish. I love all of the compartments which help me keep everything organized. It was my best buy yet!,5
Eddie Bauer Musical Rocking Bassinet,"When we were first shopping around for a bassinet and reading reviews online we felt that this was a beautiful bassinet with to many drawbacks.  The most notable being that when the bassinette was locked to prevent the bed section from swinging it didn\'t completely stop all movement.  A small amount of play remained in the swing when locked.We did eventually buy this bassinette because my wife liked they way it looked the most, and we found it on clearance at Target.  I figured I\'d have to rig up something to make the bassinette stationary when locked.  Well it turned out to be a non issue.  Our son is 4+ months old and even now when he kicks and wags his arms the bassinette doesn\'t really change position and is for all practical purposes stable.This is a beautiful bassinet.  Its easy to roll from room to room.  Its easy to reach into.  We experienced only one problem as we used the bassinette.  The 2nd day baby was home he threw up.  The bassinette has to be taken apart to take off the material so it can be washed; very inconvenient.  We did replace the mattress with a thicker one from Babies-R-Us.  Ironically, we rarely used the swinging feature; our baby just didn\'t like to be swung.  The bassinet was easy to assemble.  However, the screws that attached the board under the mattress to the metal tube frame stripped easily and I had to go to Home Depot and buy a package of better screws.  Oh, the music is worthless noise, but we expected that from the reviews we read.We like this bassinet.  We\'d buy it again.  However, the bassinette\'s design does have some room for improvement.",4
Eddie Bauer Musical Rocking Bassinet,"I was given this as a gift from my inlaws when I has my first son.  I loved it because it was small enough for our one bedroom apartment at the time. I had just had a c-section and this was easy to get the baby in and out of without bothering my tummy muscles.  It is beautiful too! A second baby and three moves later, the wheels broke off. But that wasn\'t that big of a deal, because the bassinet is not that heavy. It\'s also nice for both baby boys and baby girls and can switch easily between most decore.Cleaning is difficult however. We\'re expecting baby number 4 now, and I decided it was about time to take the bassinet out of storage and wash it.  I had to take apart the bassinet with a screwdriver to get the bedding off! I usually have a recieving blanket laid down on it when my babies are using it. The sheet that came with the bed is really rough, and I wasn\'t about to lay my babies down on that. Since the recieving blanket was always laid down, if the baby leaked onto it, I just washed the recieving blanket and was good. Thank goodness I did! I can\'t imagin trying to take apart the stupid thing every time the baby leaked.",4
Eddie Bauer Musical Rocking Bassinet,"When we bought this, we thought it rocked on its own like a mechanical cradle/swing, but it does not.  All in all, the construction and style are very good.",4
Eddie Bauer Musical Rocking Bassinet,"This is a beautiful bassinet but is lacking realistic features for a newborn.  Bassinet reviews were all terrible, but I chose this one because I thought this had the least negatives.  Here are the issues I found: 1. You cannot remove the cloth cover (which comes in direct contact with the baby) without disassembling the entire bassinet.  There should be velcro or something so as not to require a screwdriver to do the laundry.  2. If the baby moves in the bassinet, it rocks on its own, often startling them.  3. The ""mattress"" is thin and too large for bassinet sheets, so you either buy a new mattress or have only 1 set of sheets, again making laundry difficult.  On the pro side, it is easy to move, attractive, and relatively easy to put together.  I would not buy this again.  I would get a pack and play with a bassinet instead.",2
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"I never really liked this gate because it is somewhat hard to use. I bought another one because I needed two gates and this one was the only one available.The first one that I bought no longer works. The handle used to open and adjust it will not lift.I have the new one pressure mounted at the bottom of the stairs and it works ok for this. My banister post is round and tapered so it is smaller at the top. The pressure mounts on this gate adjust a little to fit, so it is working as a temporary fix.It would work fine for a plain pressure mount, but it is hard to step over.",2
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"I bought one of these last year and loved it so much that I had to replace my other older style gates with it. It is extremely easy to use.  I can do it one handed, which is a HUGE plus especially with daycare. I WOULD recommend this to anyone!!!",5
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"Firstly, they call it a pressure-mounted gate, but fail to inform you that if you need to use it as a true ""gate"", you need to hardware mount it. Otherwise it is a pressure-mounted barrier, not a gate. You need to hurdle it or pull it out to pass.Secondly, the mechanism was awkward. It kept sticking. Neither my wife nor I could easily slide the two panels.We returned this and bought the more expensive, but infinitely more usable First Years Hands-Free gate.",2
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"This gate is awkward to open with two hands and nearly impossible to open with one. That leaves the third hand for the baby.The main problem is the design of the lock. Instead of a latch, which most hardware mounted gates use, there are 2 rods with rubber pads on the ends that push against the door stops, which are mounted to the wall. The rods are moved in and out of the door by pulling on the large white handle at the top of the door. When the handle is down, the rods are pressed against the door stop, and when the handle is up, the rods pull back into the door. Unfortunately, the rods don\'t fully disengage from the door stops and there is still friction as the door opens. The handle itself has quite a bit of friction as one lifts it. The door itself is made of flexible plastic, so the entire door twists as one attempts to lift up on the handle while overcoming the lateral friction of the rod/door stop assembly. It eventually opens, but not without an incredible amount of two-handed difficulty. I have used many doors, and this has the worst design. I recommend a latch mechanism instead.",1
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"We live in an older home with uneven doors and originally bought a cheaper set of 2 (don\'t remember the brand). That\'s when we found out our doors are uneven and had to return those.We love, love, love this ""gate"" (our is the clear model). It comes with a mounting option, but if you don\'t want to screw anything onto your doorframe, it still works great without the mounting, you just won\'t be able to swing it open. If you choose not to mount, the gate suctions easily to any doorframe and becomes more portable to use anywhere else in the house.Another reviewer rated this gate on the fact that it can\'t swing if not mounted, that\'s common sense. This is a great gate and you don\'t even have to spend a lot!",5
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,I bought this gate nearly a year ago and it works pretty fine till now. I use the pressure mount since i\'m a renter and don\'t want to mess the door frame. I use it to block the kitchen but since my kitchen is open from two sides i\'m buying another one because my son just figured out that there\'s another entrance. The only draw back that i came across that it\'s not easy to pass over but other than that i\'d recommend it.,4
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,We bought these shortly after having our daughter. They worked well as hard mounted gates at the top AND bottom of stairs and pressure mounted between rooms. We love the fact that you can slip the gate out of the mountings if you only want to remove it temporarily. very easy to use one handed once adjusted (even while holding the baby).,5
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"This gate is decent enough for us to keep, but I am not completely happy with it.  The more it is extended, the less secure it feels.  It took a little bit for me to get accustomed to unlocking and locking it.  Even after I got used to it, it still seems to require a lot of pressure to get it locked into place and tight enough that I feel it is secure.  We haven\'t had any problems with our child getting past the gate, so we have kept it.  It is reasonably priced and does work--I just think there are probably more user friendly gates available.",3
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"I use this gate to keep my two Cocker Spaniels and one Shih Tzu out of my bedrooms and it works perfectly, although one of the Cockers jumped over it because my husband told her how to do so.  That\'s why I decided to mount the gate hardware and left a little space at the bottom so the gate is a little taller and now she can\'t jump over and neither can pass under. I can take the gate easily off and mount it pressure on any door frame of my house. It\'s very easy to open and close, a bit complicate at the beginning if you don\'t know how it works, but then there is no problem at all. This gate looks great and it is not expensive. I really love my gate.",5
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"There is nothing to complain about this gate.  It is inexpensive, yet well made and easy to use.  I use at a door way to divide the laundry room (where I keep cat food and litter box) and dining room.  It works great, easy to use.  My cat doesn\'t mind it either.",5
JEEP Wrangler All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,I brought the stroller and after putting in together i have to return it. it was too small for my 12-month old daughter... there was no room to put her arms... they need to make it wider!! I do like it but too bad i had to return it... just to narrow...,2
JEEP Wrangler All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,"The stroller is great for quick trips to the store and what not, compared to the oversized strollers that we have or soon to have, either way I love it!!. I have the Eddie Bauer edition stroller with carseat included and I love that one also!. I ordered the jeep umbrella stroller 2 days ago, and recieved it in the 2 day requirement that they said it was going to be shipped and recieved it today in excellent condition and was very easy to assemble and and easy to maneuver and easy to handle. Thanks Mrs. Anna Anderson",5
JEEP Wrangler All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,"Searching for a stroller that would accomodate my son who is in a spica cast was near to impossible.  The wonderful (and expensive) travel system no longer works because he is too wide.  The seat in this stroller is PERFECT for us.  It is deep enough that his butt can fit in, but shallow so that his thighs can hang over and the cast fits!  It is a miracle stroller for us and handles amazingly well too.  If you know anyone whose child is either in or headed to spicaville recommend this stroller.",5
JEEP Wrangler All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,"I`m 1.96 mts and the handlebars of the stroller are  very small and I have a back pain, please make larger the handlebars.",4
JEEP Wrangler All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,"This is a great stroller.  We purchased it for our recent trip for my 31/2 year old daughter.  This stroller is strong, sturdy and supports my 30 pound daughter without a problem.  She loves it to, it\'s really comfortable.  The canopy came in really handy on those really sunny hot days. This is a great value, a great ""cool"" looking stroller - well worth the money. The side pockets are great and I even added an additional bag off the back of the stroller for extra storage. It takes up the same room as a regular umbrella stroller, is light and very easy to open and close. I highly recommend it.",5
JEEP Wrangler All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,"This is an excellent light-weight stroller. It doesn\'t have much storage on the sides, but you can hang your diaper bag easily over the handles.  I have a very large 8 month old and have used this stroller exclusively for the last 4 months.  It folds very compactly and is very light - I carry my son in one arm and this in the other hand.  The only feature that I feel could be better is the sun shade, it is a little small and awkard but that is my only complaint.My husband and I are both tall and have no problems with the size of this stroller.",4
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"I initially bought this bouncer based on all the positive reviews, plus I needed something to put my baby in for a few minutes. He liked it at first, but I think found the music and lights a but too much. I ended up buying the Ocean Wonders bouncer because he likes staring at things and he seems to be content watching the bubbles and the fish.",3
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"An essential piece of equipment for baby.  The perfect place for the baby to sit while he watches the world go by.  The vibration soothes the baby and lulls them to sleep.  The colorful toys are bright and easy to grab, but a bit much for newborns. Its a good thing that the huge toybar is removable. Overall, the best gift a new mother can get or give.",4
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"We got this as a baby shower gift.  I didn\'t think we would be using it until the baby was a few months old..boy was I wrong!!!Our precious girl had a touch of colic and most nights, nothing else would do.  We would turn on the vibration and bounce it a little and it would soothe her to sleep.  She didn\'t care much for the music and lights at first, but that didn\'t matter, we just removed the toy bar.  We use it everyday and she loves it! The friends that bought us ours are expecting and we are returning the favor by getting them one.  I hope they enjoy it as much as we do!",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"I borrowed this bouncer from a friend and LOVED it.  My baby slept in it for the first 3 mo. It contoured her body and kept her flailing limbs still.  During the day she loved the play bar attachment and I loved that it was more interactive than other bouncers I had seen.Eventually, the left kick pad wore out and I bought the new model Kick and Play to replace it.  I love that the sound and lights respond to both kicks and batting of the hanging toys.  HOWEVER, this new model is a lot more upright than the old one.  My baby is 3 mo. old, but always ends up slumped toward the edge of the seat for a place to rest her head.  It would be totally unsuitable for a newborn.  I wish they still made the original Kick and Play.  Unfortunately, this one is going back to the store :(",2
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,I really loved all the bells and whistles and so did my son.The problem:  He would slump over ever time he fell asleep. Not good support for him. He is 2 months old and weighs just under 13 pounds. I returned it today and bought the linkadoos bouncer.,3
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"We have had this kick and play since my daughter was born. She is now 8 months old. She still enjoys playing with it. She does not always want to sit in it now, but she will sit on the floor next to it and play. We used it plenty when she was an infant. This will say in our collection for the next child.",4
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"I initially shied away from this bouncer, because it is so obnoxiously bright.  (I think my words were, ""It looks like Dora the Explorer barfed all over it!)  BUT, baby likes it!  I particuarly was interested in the controls that allow me to either make the music and lights play continuously, or, have them play in response to baby\'s kicks.My main complaint about this bouncer is that it is difficult to take when traveling, because it does not fold up, and the frame does not come apart unless you take the screws out.  The frame of the bouncer we had with our first child came apart easily, so, when traveling, we just took it apart and put it in a bag.  With this one, the front portion, with the feet and the vibrator control, flips up, but this is of no help if you\'re trying to pack it in a car for a trip.",3
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"My little boy wasn\'t to thrilled with the bouncer at first and is still getting adjusted with the detachable lighted entertainment bar, but he just loves his bouncer now.  The vibrating seat really helps him calm down too.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"We put our son in this seat from the time he was a newborn.  It was the only way I got to take a shower (bring it in the bathroom and put him in it) since my son didn\'t sleep well.  He never did fall asleep in it (unfortunately) but the vibrations soothed our cranky, colicky baby and the music and the play bar entertained him so my husband and I could eat together.  It washes well and was easy to put together.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"If you are expecting a child, go out and buy this bouncer (if you haven\'t already). My daughter loves this bouncer, I started putting her in it at 3 months (there really is no support for a newborn\'s unstable head)and she was amazed at the bright lights, songs and vibrating seat. She kickes at the toys with her feet and then lets them fall down on the bouncer and it rewards her by playing a song. I love this bouncer and don\'t know what I would do without it, I can get my housework done and she is highly entertained and learning at the same time!",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,My Grandbaby loves it!  Very entertaining and keeps him busy.  He loves to reach and pull.  The lights make him laugh and kick.  He coo\'s a lot when he\'s in the bouncer.  He Loves It!  Great Item!,5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"This bouncy seat has kept my 4 month-old daughter happy since she was born.  I used to use the toy arch all the time and it kept her occupied while I showered, cooked, etc.  I seriously don\'t know how I would have showered without it!  I like the fact that the music can be either played continuously or activated by the baby.  Now that she\'s older, I often remove the toy bar so that I can play with her while she sits in the seat.  We often take it with us when visiting, so I just wish that it was collapseable.  But that may be a problem with all bouncy seats.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,This bouncer has turned out to be a great buy.  My little guy is now 5 months old and we are now using the bouncer to feed him his rice cereal.  He can\'t sit up on his own yet so we\'re not using the high chair.  He\'s over 17 pounds and 26 inches long and the bouncer still fits him.  We have another one that he\'s already outgrown.  He really likes the light up part of the toys and the music isn\'t too annoying.  The fabric seems a little bright at first but we\'ve gotten used to it.,5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"Our son has really enjoyed this bouncer.  It has been really durable and entertaining for him.  We put him in it each morning while we make breakfast, and he stays entertained the whole time.  He really gets into making the sounds go off!  He has just outgrown the weight limit, and we are going to miss it.  I don\'t know about other bouncers, but this one has been great!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"This is THE bouncer chair to have.  This chair saved us the first 5 months of our daughter\'s life.  She had reflux, and sometimes, this chair was the only place she could sleep or would not cry.  I almost cried myself when she outgrew it.  The seat sling is deeper than some of the other seats on the market, which makes it seem safer to me...I also liked that the activities and music were bright and happy.  Also, The activity bar removes so easily when you don\'t want to use it.  Now that she has outgrown it, I have carefully put it away in the event that we have another baby.  I can\'t be without this chair!  If you are confused about which bouncer to buy or register for, don\'t be.  THIS IS THE ONE.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"our little guy loves this bouncer. he loves making it light up and make sounds. i could do without the pattern and colors (i think most baby stuff is kind of ugly-but i guess they dig the colors) but the important thing is it\'s a fun, safe place for him to play, learn (cause and effect) and nap.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,I just bought this for my 2 month old daughter and she loves it!  The lights and sounds keep her occupied for a while and she never seems bored with it.  A great buy!,5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this bouncer! She kicks & gets all excited as I put her in it. There are two settings, one with continual lights and music, the other is activated by kicking on the bottom (where their feet are). It keeps her very entertained & is a great help for me to get things done if I need to. The seat also has a vibration setting for the seat itself...sometimes she even falls asleep in it while watching the lights & the soothing vibration relaxes her. I highly re putting them in, oppose to an hour to wash the whole car seat.  Remember on vacations it is sometimes not easy to wash your childs car seat.  Do you really want them sitting in a messy seat?  It is perfect for car rides, airplane rides ( when its not that easy to change a diaper ), and in the stroller.  I am pregnant with the second and already have them in the mail and on their way to me.  I recommend them to everyone!!!",5
"Badger Basket Elite Oval Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",This was purchased for my daughter in law and son for their 4 child.  They had a space issue and this fit perfectly where they wanted it.  Easy to put together and it is sturdy.,5
"Badger Basket Elite Oval Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",This was a gift to my granddaughter who is expecting her first little girl in Dec.  She absolutely loved it and said it looks like it was made for a little princess.  I am very happy with it.,5
"Badger Basket Elite Oval Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle","I want to start off by mentioning I usually buy products that have several 5 star reviews and there is always someone who doesn\'t like an item, but I have to admit, this item is not worth the 5 stars.I bought a Summer Infant Bassinet from Amazon just a week prior and my parents were looking for a nicer bassinet for their home.  I found this one and thought it was so pretty in the picture, however, good luck getting it to look like the picture in your home.The worst part about this item was the ""pre-drilled"" holes were nowhere close to where they needed to be.  The directions were very limited and left you guessing.  Lastly, this whole piece is very flimsy, we won\'t be keeping the canopy on for fear of it just falling over.I would not suggest this product because there are much higher quality bassinets on the market for a much better price.",1
"Badger Basket Elite Oval Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",I bought this for my first grandchild and it is exactly what I expected. Not only can my daughter use this for her baby but she can pass it down from generation to generation. What a wonderful family heirloom. I would recommend this product to anyone getting ready to start a family. It is beautiful.,5
Soft &amp; Fuzzy Pooh 4 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set,"I JUST REGISTERED FOR THE SOFT & FUZZY POOH BEDDING AND ALL THE CUTE THINGS THAT MATCH THE SET.  I LOVE THIS SET, WELL I LOVE ANYTHING POOH.  IT IS PERFECT FOR PARENTS WHO DON\'T PLAN ON FINDING OUT THE SEX OF THEIR BABY.  I CAN\'T WAIT TO DECORATE MY BABY\'S NURSEY WITH IT.",5
Infantino TubSider,"This is the only baby gift that we received that we still use.  It may look like a really silly idea, but it is very conventient for bathing the young ones every night.Give it as a gift and your friends will thank you - maybe not right away, but definitely after they use it for a while and learn to appreciate it.",5
Infantino TubSider,This product is very helpful when it comes to bath time. I\'ve even used it for my dog! Sure beats adding towels under my knees on a hard bathroom floor and the gel is super comfy. You can also adjust the seat setting for different sized people which is a plus.,4
Kel-Gar Sun Stop\'r - Kwik Cabana with Shade,"Overall, I really like this tent. It opens nicely for easy set up. It stores easily in a portable bag. I like the opening on stilts so my dog has easy access. However, when I try to reach in to pick up the baby, I end up knocking over one or both if the stilts of the tent openi g. It\'s easy to put then back, but not completely sturdy. Wind can easily move the tent if its a windy day or blow sand in if it super windy. Overall, it worked for covering our baby at tw beach, it wasn\'t too hit inside the tent and it protected her for the most part depending on the angle is the sun. I would buy it again if I had the option.",4
Zanzibar Toddler Bedding 4 Piece Set,This is so cute!  I actually had the jungle jamboree crib bedding for my son and it is discontinued and couldn\'t find the toddler bedding in it.  This matches perfectly and the emroidery is very pretty.,5
Zanzibar Toddler Bedding 4 Piece Set,"I have the crib set of this including the little wall decorations and lamp so was happy to find this so that once my grandson is a toddler and we turn the crib into a toddler bed, his room can keep this theme which is so cute!  I love this set.",5
Zanzibar Toddler Bedding 4 Piece Set,"This betting is just as described.  It is cute, the sheets fit toddler beds as promised. I only wish that the blanket could be bound on one end to keep it on the bed like the top sheet.  Both sheets and blanket wash well.",5
Zanzibar Toddler Bedding 4 Piece Set,"I have the Zanzibar valances and lamp in my son\'s room so I was excited to recieve this bedding.  I live in Michigan and our winters are cold.  I was hoping the comforter blanket would have been thicker and warmer.  It is a thin fleece blanket with a cute design.  Great for fall and spring, but I question if it is warm enough for winter.  The sheet is clever.  It is fitted on one side so that it cannot ride up or be kicked off.  I like that given I often have to tuck my 2 year old in again after he falls asleep.  The design does have a lot going on but it is cute for a little one.",3
Mustela Mustela Spray Hydra Bebe,"I love the smell of this spray and it hydrates really well without being greasy or oily at all.It keeps my DD skin fresh and sweet and I noticed how nice my hands were feeling, so now I use it too and I love it.I rarely like lotion at all because it leaves me feeling shellacked, but this really sinks in and feels light and fresh.The outer cap fits very snuggly so it doesn\'t pop off and mist the inside of your diaper bag, which is a real asset.This would be great in a shower gift basket since the scent is gender neutral and the spray\'s technique of delivering lotion is so quick and easy to apply.I use many of the Mustela products and am always impressed at how great they work and how great they smell.",5
Primo Baby Gift Basket - Girl,"Very pleasantly surprised, filled with lots of quality items and adorable little goodies, ill be back soon!!",5
Soft &amp; Fuzzy Pooh Night Light,Super cute either with the light on or off.  It matches perfectly with the Peek-A-Pooh theme my daughter chose for her nursery.  This was received exactly as I had hoped and would definitely recommend purchasing from this seller again.,5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","My twins slept in these bassinets until they reached the weight limit.  The top/bassinet floor bows down in the middle, so I had to put rolled blankets in the middle to keep them from rolling into the sides, to make sure they stayed on their backs.  But I loved having them sleeping in these bassinets in my room, right beside me!  Also, it is not noted anywhere that I could find in the item description, but this pack and play is bigger than all the others, so standard pack and play sheets will not fit.  I have yet to find any sheets marketed for this pack and play, so I had to make liberal use of sheet savers and burp cloths under their heads to catch the drool/spit up that inevitably happens.  I never wound up using it as a pack and play, just in the beginning for the bassinets.",4
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance",This was perfect for the newborn stage with twins when we wanted our babies in our bedroom with us.  We were able to have our twins in this bassinet until they were almost 15  pounds each.  After that we used the pack n\' play when traveling and loved the extra play room it offered over smaller pack n plays.,5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance",I love this the other reviews say the babies sink in the middle mine dont and they sleep pretty good in this. The only problem I have with it is that its soo huge so make sure you make lots of room for it and if you plan on getting sheets for it playpen sheets do not fit youll have to use crib sheets.,5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","This Pack\'n\'Play is great if you\'re expecting twins.It\'s pretty staright forward as far as assembly goes.The play area is bigger than I expected and the bassinets are sturdy.i havent gotten a chance to use it yet as my babies haven\'t been born yet, but I am looking forward to using it.It\'s a great value for what it is, especially when compared to the price of a single.",5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","My husband and I received this bassinet as a gift from his parents since we are having twin girls. We wanted to have something in our bedroom for the first couple of months since I know there will be lots of late night feedings and what not. At first the size of it is intimidating but again what do you expect, it is built for two babies. After having it already set up in our bedroom it doesn\'t seem as large anymore. My husband had a really easy time setting it up. It was to heavy for me to lift right now. Once the twins will be sleeping in their cribs, we will be moving it out to the living room. I like how it has wheels for easy moving and it collapses down easily enough. I am very pleased with the playard and can\'t wait to begin using it. I would say if you are having twins, this is a must! It also arrived in about 5 days and I live overseas. I was very impressed.",5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","My granddaughter had twins, so this was a gift.  She uses it...and loves it. Carries it with her when she comes down our way from Mt shasta.",5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","This has been a fantastic find for our little ones whom we wanted to sleep in our room (lower SIDS rate for twins that sleep in their own space in parent\'s bedroom is one of the reasons we opted for this.) As of a few days ago, we\'ve finally had to move our boy to a separate sleeping vessel, but prior to that they spent every night in the bassinet. We had to move our boy for 2 reasons: 1) he\'s getting a little hefty for this bassinet 2.) he\'s started night ninja moves that with the shared floor of the bassinet, wakes his sister. Our little girl happily still sleeps in it, though I\'m not sure for how long as her length may start being a factor.I can not comment as to the playpen aspect of it yet as we haven\'t used it. The floor of the bassinet is the same as the floor to playpen and we haven\'t haven\'t had sagging problems others have mentioned, but that may be because the bassinets evenly spaces out the babies. For reference our little ones are 13lbs and 16+lbs. Even if we run into problems later, I would still say this was totally worth it instead of having a huge bulky crib in our bedroom. (That would have to be disassembled to get through the door!)The rating is 4 stars instead of 5 because the part that the babies lie on can be a bit wonky for a new parent. It has to fold up for travel, and as such each side has 2 vertical folds in it that is less than ideal. Babies may tend to slightly favor an area because of these little folds, and my guess is that can cause the dreaded flat head problem if it\'s constantly in the same position (rather them naturally moving their head where no folds would cause favoritism. Upon examination, I believe that the design could be corrected, but it wasn\'t a big deal for our particular situation. We did have a period where we placed towels under PART of the bassinet floor, but that was to help give it a slight incline that is sometime needed for twins. This is not a defect of the product, but may have helped with the folds.",4
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","As the mother of twins, I found this product to be quite sturdy and reliable.  Cleaning up major spitups was sometimes challenging, but, overall not too bad.  Having a place where both of my (preemie) babies could be placed safely was very handy.  Setup was easy and we\'re still using the main section as a playard.  The fact that one side has wheels made it even easier to use!",4
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance",we are really pleased with the item that we purchased from graco pack &#34;n play . looking forward to purchasing my more items from graco once aging thanks for the making my purchase and easy experience.,5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance",Bought this for my new twin niece and nephew.  It was very handy for them when staying with grandma (who kept them while parents were at work).  She used it for their naps so they wouldn\'t need a separate crib at her house.  They\'re almost a year old and haven\'t figured out how to crawl out yet.  Great product!,5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","Sturdy, good size, well-made, and (apparently) comfortable for twin babies to sleep in.  This bassinet has come in very, very handy --my life would be a lot harder without it.  This is highly recommended.",5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance",This is an excellent choice for twins. It keeps them separate but together for ease of access. While accommodating both it fits in the same area as a crib.,5
"Graco Pack \'N Play with Twins Bassinet, Vance","Our twin preemies slept in the this the first several months of life.  It worked great for us to have a safe spot for them to sleep close to our bed.  However, they ended up having pretty bad reflux at nights, so after a couple months we switched them to Graco\'s Rock n Play Sleepers which allowed them to sleep slightly inclined.  We continued to use this as a play pen, and one of them still sleeps in it when we are on vacation sometimes (they are 2.5).  This play pen is larger than a standard play pen which is nice for their comfort, but also takes up more space.  We also were unable to find a mattress online that fit it.  We ended up making one out of a large piece of foam that we cut to size.  Sheets that fit this are also hard to find, but we have found that a standard crib sheet attached with sheet clips to work safely.",4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I knew before I bought this that my little guy would love it--nothing like being able to stand up on your own and pick and choose from all these cool toys right within easy reach! It\'s a hoot to watch him grab the bendy animals and try to get them into his mouth, and he will spend long minutes hitting the spinning toys to watch them go around. I\'m looking forward to when he\'s a little older and better coordinated, because I know from seeing older babies in the saucer that it will just become more fun for him as he\'s better able to balance himself and use his hands.What I didn\'t like about this was how long it took to put together--not particularly hard, but it was complicated, and took over an hour of assembling small parts. What was particularly bad was putting the clear plastic spinner (the one with the monkeys) into its proper slot. I think it was designed for someone much stronger than a 5\' 2"" woman, but I eventually managed it using a screwdriver to lever the plastic sides where the slots are apart enough to let the spinner\'s metal rod slip in. But if you have a guy around when you\'re building this, get him to do it--it might be easier.It\'s also a bitch to get this thing to fold properly, unfortunately, though I\'m assuming it will become easier the more often I do it. The first time, however, I gave up in frustration because the legs just would not bend.But overall I would say this was a great toy, and definitely worth the purchase.",4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"My 5 1/2 month old baby boy really likes this toy.  He is very active and I was skeptical at first.  He doesn\'t spend a long time in it, but he does really enjoy and have fun with all the toys on it! Definitely worth it!",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,Bought this for my grandaughter when she was almost 6 months old. Took her a couple of days to really start to enjoy it. Toys are gr8 for entertaining & teething. Now that she is 8 months old & walking/ running- she doesn\'t like to get into it anymore but prefers to run around it and play with all the toys. Still gets alot of use. Probably my best short term investment. Did take grampa some time to put together but well worth it.,5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"Initially I was okay with this toy.  However, the plastic is hard on a lot of the pieces and I thought my baby might injure himself, he didn\'t.  The part that I am most unhappy about is the book like tabs with stickers.  The stickers have worn away with teething, most likely swallowing it.  I will not use this product again.",2
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,My baby is very happy when placed in the Exersaucer.  A good investment.,5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"My son plays in this daily and loves it!  We have it in our bathroom and it is the only way I am able to shower, dry my hair, and put on makeup daily.  It keeps him happy the whole time I get ready.  Despite other reviews it is very easy to fold up and travel with.  You just have to know how to do it.  I struggled a little, but my husband collapsed it in about 10 seconds.  The only frustrating thing is that the batteries in the musical toy are not replaceable.  So when it dies, that is it.  I found a web site to order a new musical toy and some new toys to keep him interested and it was worth it.  Get this for your child for hours and hours of fun!",4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I at first didnt hear much about the exersaucer, I saw it while at toys r us one day and bought it as a spur of the moment type thing. I brought it home and the moment we put my son in it, he just fell in love. He bites all the toys, he plays with all of them. He just adores the toy and wants to be in it 24/7. It keeps him entertained while I make his milk during the day and after his naps. It has cute circus music too that you can turn off. It\'s easy to put together and very colorful. It also has a seat that spins around if the baby walks around. This toy has taught my son a lot and even other children! My friends 6 month old is VERY fussy, she ONLY wants her mother to hold her all the time and she gets very crabby. Well they came over a few weeks ago and she fell in love with the exersaucer as well and didnt want to be picked up anymore. So her mother bought her an exersaucer now, this is an awesome toy and I recommend it to every parent.",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"Honestly I have a Baby Einstein one at home that is absolutely great.  This one I got as a 2nd for my child to use at daycare.  Granted if it\'s just a spare, then it\'s totally fine for the money, but for one you\'d use normally it\'s not worth it.  The top is spring loaded, so under the very top play portion are some springs, I\'m assuming so the child can jump in the thing and play.  Truthfully, they don\'t need springs to be able to jump when they are ready to.  Also, the 3 feet on the very bottom that you pull out so the saucer does not rock, are quite flimsy and don\'t really do what they are intended to do.  Between this and the spring loaded top, it\'s more like a coaster ride for someone too young to appreciate it.  Instead what it does is makes the thing feel very unsturdy to me and apparently to my child as well, who is always scared when left in it, because the thing moves all over.  The toys are just ok.  If you just want plain toys fine, although I prefer something a little more educational or something that appeals more to their senses.  My child just sits there and doesn\'t touch anything.  Partially probably because he\'s scared the thing will move again and partially because they aren\'t all that exciting.  Yet, put him in the Baby Einstein one, he\'s happy as a clam.  I\'ve heard of other people that purchased the higher-end Evenflo ones and although I haven\'t tried them, they were happy with those.  But for the value and what you get, I\'d definitely choose the Baby Einstein over this.",2
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I started using the exersaucer when my son was four months because he could control his head.  I loved the toy because I felt safe using it at such a young age.  My son\'s favorate part of the toy was the circus tent that spins and lights up.  Unfortuanately, the batteries in the circus tent are NOT replacable.  The circus tent stopped lighting up and playing music about a month and half after we purchased the item.  Now my son has lost interest in the exersaucer since it no longer lights up or plays music.",2
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"After shopping around for an activity saucer, I decided on this one due to the price.  I wanted the Baby Einstein one for my son, but I found it too expensive.  It took me about 45 min to assemble with just a manual phillips screwdriver.  Once I put my 5 month old in the exersaucer, he immediately played with the toys.  So far after a month, he\'s still entertained.  I love how it\'s foldable.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with a 5-6 month old that needs to be entertained while you get things done around the house.",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,Great investment. We first got it when my daughter was still to small to sit in it. But soon just stuffed a couple of pillows around her and she had a blast. Takes a little effort to put together but really not too difficult. I thought is was fun. Folds down for easy storage. Most parts come off for cleaning. We still have it sitting on our porch. We took the seat cloth out and my daught climbes in from underneath and plays with it.,4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"My daughter is 7 months old and this is the only product I have ever felt compelled to review.  I purchased this exersaucer to use at our vacation home and at grandmom\'s house.  I felt uneasy putting my baby in this from the start.  Not quality. It is terrible!  If you look at the picture closely the seal, the rocking horse and elephant all have protrusions on them. They are like little hammers, the plastic on them is really hard!  My daughter pushed on the seal and it bounced back and whacked her in the head. It caused a huge bump and tears! To be safe, we removed all of them.  The only thing left on this for her to play with is a soft lion that she can teethe and a rattle. I could have bought both for under $10.00!  The carousel spinner plays stupid music and blinks a single red light that barely attracts her attention.  I am leery of the carousel also, since the plastic on this is really hard too.  It seems to have the potential to injure her as well.  THIS IS JUST JUNK!  I have reported what happened to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  The idea of this folding is wonderful and one of the reasons for the purchase, but everytime we try to fold it up, the legs fall off and the springs pop out.  The food tray is useless. (Who feeds their child in the middle of playing?) The space this takes up could be much better utilized with another toy.  I have a Baby Einstein exersaucer at home and it is so much better, safer and much more entertaining.  Spend $10-20 more, it is worth it!  I am taking this back to the store tonight!",1
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,My son loves his ExerSaucer.  We started putting him in it at 4 months and he just stared at the toys while we played with them.  Now only one month later he loves spinning the wheel and pulling all of the animals towards him.  Of course they all go straight into his mouth.  He has also figured out how to practice standing in it.  We have already gotten our moneys worth with this toy.,4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,My daughter loves this saucer!  She is entertained by the toys still and it\'s been about 5 months now.  At 9 months she can rock it back and forth for more fun.  However if you have older children watch that they don\'t hold one of the toys back and then let it go because my 5 year old did that and my 9 month old now has a bruise on her forehead.  Other than that I am pleased with it.,4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"We are in Canada (Sherbrooke, Quebec most specifically), our little daughter Marie-Soleil like this toy.  She is 3 1/2 month and she love staying in there for almost 30 minutes.  She can already play with the toys which is great !",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"This exersaucer toy was purchased for use by my four month old grandson.  He loves it!  This will serve as fun entertainment until he is able to walk.After reading other reviews I was concerned about the many pieces described for assembly.  Not to worry.  The pieces and directions were very clear, and within a half hour the project was complete.  If each step in constructing is followed as written and illustrated there won\'t be any problem putting the exersaucer together.Signed, a very happy and pleased grandma.",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I took my six month old son to Babies R Us to ""try out"" all the exesauers and he liked this one the best, and it was one of the least expensive. The bright colors and different toys keep him entertained and some of the toys I thought were boring (like the 2 page book) are his favorite. I agree with the other reviewer - the snack tray seems like kind of a waste of space, but I just use it to put other toys on which he promptly throws on the floor - a fun game.  The height adjustment accomodates babies that are on the smaller size and will grow with your child until he is probably to old to want to play in it anymore. A great choice and you can\'t beat the price.",4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I read someone elses review that says ""couldn\'t have taken a shower without it"", all I have to say to that is, hallelujah! Everyday for months I put this thing in the bathroom in front of our wall mirror, my son loved it. Between playing with all the toys and smiling/talking to himslef in the mirror, I could once again take a shower that lastest more than 2 minute, and even put on some make-up and brush my hair!And just like the other mom said, put them in this with the Baby Einstein on and you\'ve got yourself one life saving baby cocktail! My son loves it and I couldn\'t get very much done without it! Although now that he\'s 8 months and very mobile, he doesn\'t like it so much anymore, he\'d rather be free to chase the dogs and throw the dvd\'s all over the house. =)",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"Our baby really likes this exersaucer.  I shopped a lot of them and some are so basic and boring its amazing.  This one collapses easily, which is a great added bonus.  Also, you can purchase individual plug-ins to replace the ones that come with this exersaucer to refresh it now and then.",4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"You need to buy this for your child.  My daughter, at 7 months was totally into this exersaucer.  My wife and I worked fast to put it together and plopped our daughter in it before we were supposed to go out to dinner.  She IMMEDIATELY knew what to do with every piece on the exersaucer.  Do yourself a favor and buy one now!",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"We bought this toy when our daughter was 4 months old.  She grew with it...loved the music, which is why we bought this particular model.  However, we soon found that once the battery ran out on the music toy, it couldn\'t be replaced.  That part of the exersaucer became useless.  We\'ve since had another baby.  He never got to use the music part of the toy.  We took it down after one month of use because of boredom.  The plastic toys are cheap and boring.  Since the only part that was good about this toy was the music, it\'s a waste of time and money because you can\'t replace the battery.",1
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"My daughter is 7 months old. I bought this for her about 2 months ago after trying a friend\'s saucer. She loves it! It keeps her occupied for up to 40 minutes sometimes. I think it\'s been great for increasing the strength of her legs, and the saucer has so many different features, that it really very effectively stimulates a baby\'s development. My only criticism is that it is not easy to collapse, and it only fits through the doorways in my house if I turn it exactly the right direction. Also: I paid $20 less for it, including shipping, from Amazon than it would have cost at a certain mart-type superstore in my area.",4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"Our daughter loves this exersaucer.  She loves to bounce in it and, as she puts EVERYTHING in her mouth, she has a variety of things to keep her occupied with the different textures.  It is a nice for me in that it keeps her entertained in a safe place while I do housework and other things where I can move around the house and don\'t have to worry about her getting into everything.  Definitely a good buy for us.",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"My Son has bee using this sine he was 4 months old and he loves it. He`s now 6 1/2 and hasn`t gotten bored of it, As a matter of fact he love it even more since he`s teething he love to chew on the loin. This is one of his favorite toys. So I give this 5 Stars",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I bought this from WalMart for about the same price listed here. I got it when my daughter was about 4 months old. She is in it a few times a day and loves being in it. She loves all of the toys and chews on them with delight. This toy allows for us to get things done around the house and for my husband and I to both sit down and have dinner together. I would recommend this for any new parent, you child will love it.",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I purchased an excersaucer for my first son, and this particular model for my second... I loved both of them and recommend them to all of my mama friends!",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"We bought this when my son was 6 months old. He never liked it that much in the beginning -- he would jump up and down and make it rock back and forth. At 9 months, we left him in this and then heard a big bang -- he had managed to jump out of it! Fortunately he was not hurt and was happily playing on the floor where he landed. This doesn\'t have straps to hold the baby in. If you have a very active kid (ours started walking at 9 months), then this is not very safe. To be fair, while it lasted it did keep him occupied for 5-10 minutes at a stretch before he wanted to be let out.",3
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,I bought this for a second location (not our primary residence) so I didn\'t want to spend too much.  This was cheaper than the other simlar products and my daughter couldn\'t love it more.  I\'m very happy with it.,5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"This is a tremendous ""bouncy seat"" for a toddler.  My son is 8 months old and has been enjoying this for a few months now and seems to never grow tired of it.The only problem we did have is that we were shipped an open package from Amazon (presumably a return) and there were at least 10 pieces missing from the box.  Luckily Evenflo stood behind their product and had all of the missing parts delivered to me with a few days.",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"We received this as a gift for our daughter.  She loves it!.  It keeps her off the floor & contained while entertaining her so we can clean, cook or do other things.  The little red circus twirly thing did ""run out of juice"" and now doesn\'t make noise anymore.  I haven\'t yet figured out if there are batteries that you can replace in there somewhere. Very enjoyable!",5
Tuckie Duckie Adjustable Bath Support,"This was great until I put it in the washer , it had large white spots and looks like it going to fall apart.it was a gift for my daughter who just had her baby jan 23rd 2009 so she we just started to use it.very unhappy.",2
The First Years - Natural Comfort Breastpump,"I was very excited when I saw this Electric pump for just $45 but you get what you pay for. It has great sucktion but the speed is extremely slow and very little milk gets into the bottle. Not because it can\'t suck but because it is totally sealed. Think of a straw that can hold water when you have your finger over one end - that is like this pump. With pumping your breast and the bottle totally seals off the valve and no milk drips through which makes the 3 way bottle adapter fill with milk and back up into the pump. As soon as you release your breast from sucktion to milk drips down into the bottle but really - how often do you want to do that? It must be a design flaw and I\'m hoping they fix it. The 3-way bottle adapter is great though - it fits with our gerber, medela and advent bottles - not with our playtex one though. If you are looking for a pump I\'d advise not to get this one - get a nice hand pump or spend a little more and get the medela electric.",3
The First Years - Natural Comfort Breastpump,"After reading the other reviews I had to comment.  I\'ve been using this one for about four months.  The issue of milk backing up into the chamber is easily solved by cleaning the flaps well so they don\'t stick.  It only takes a few seconds to run it under hot water.I\'ve used this pump three times a day for months and haven\'t burned the motor out yet.  I would guess that people who burned the motor out probably let the milk back up into the unit (the instructions warn you not to do that).  Motors and milk don\'t get along!As far as speed - it\'s a little slower than a hospital grade pump - that\'s to be expected.  I can still pump both breasts in less than ten minutes with this unit, though.  I can\'t imagine buying a pump costing [...] when this one does the job for less than [...]",5
The First Years - Natural Comfort Breastpump,"When I had my first child my employer didn\'t have a private place for me to pump.  Since I refused to pump in the bathroom as everytime the toilet is flushed it sends bacteria and feces into the air, my only option was a battery operated pump.  I bought it at BRU, and besides the noise and millions of batteries I went through it was okay.  I didn\'t however pull enough of the milk out of my breast and I started to develop mastitis in both.  I only recommend this item if you have no option buy to use battery operated devises, other wise, spend the money to buy a nice one, you\'ll send it eventually in batteries anyway.",3
Baby Trend Chatham High Chair - Navy HighChair,"We\'ve had this chair (in a different pattern) for 2.5 years and two kids now.  Its durability is its best feature.  The cloth cover is soft for a baby, and small messes wipe clean fairly easily with a sponge.  It even goes into the washer, and has held up well without too much fading.  Just be sure to drip dry, not machine dry.  Underneath, there\'s a handy vinyl pad which you can sit the baby on while waiting for the cloth cover to dry.  However, the Velcro that holds it to the chair itself seems to have slid a bit, leaving sizeable areas of sticky glue exposed which attract crumbs (how the crumbs get all the way under there is beyond me, but they do).When cleaning the straps, though, there\'s more of a problem.  The shoulder/lap straps are very difficult to remove for cleaning, and the crotch strap is IMPOSSIBLE to remove, and that\'s the strap that gets the most soiled!  The instructions offer no enlightenment on this, either.  The shoulder/waist straps, once removed, do come perfectly clean in the washer; then hang to dry.The tray-on-tray is nice, too, although a baby with messy fingers can manage to get food under the top tray and onto the main tray anyway, and care must be taken to clean food out of the seam on the main tray.  One major problem with the tray is its height.  The height of the tray in relation to the chair is not adjustable, and is too high for smaller babies just learning to eat solids.  I like putting the bowl on the tray as I feed, and it\'s difficult for me sometimes to navigate around the tray to get to my baby\'s mouth, since her mouth aligns right where the tray is!  It would also be nice if the tray could get just a little closer to baby to minimize mess.The folding legs feature is quite convenient to keep floor space available when not in use.  It\'s also been handy for us when eating out on our deck -- folding the legs allows us to roll the chair through the door and onto the deck with no trouble.  The tray can store on notches on the back of the legs, too, for an added space saver.The adjustable chair height feature is nice because as the child gets older, it allows you to push the chair into the table (sans tray) as if he/she were a ""big person"" like the rest of the family.The only other thing is that I wish this chair had some sort of storage compartment for wipes, bibs, etc.***UPDATE 12-31-08: Our younger daughter is now 2.5, and she still uses this chair, mostly without the tray, pushed into the table.  However, the vinyl pad underneath the cloth pad has ripped at the seam, and she has begun to reach under and pull out bits of the foam inside it.  This began after about 3.5 years and two daughters of use.",3
BABYBJORN Diaper Back Pack - City Blue,"I bought this backpack about 5 years ago.  It has been on MANY trips, including to Asia, and it looks as good as new! It is a very functional bag, the bottle insulator pockets on the side really do work, and the bag is very easy to clean by throwing it into the washer.  It\'s attractive in design and  stands up to the Baby Bjorn name.  Well worth the investment!",5
Baby Bjorn Diaper Backpack- City Black,"I ordered this product on Nov 5th of 2006.  It still has not arrived.  When I ordered the product, it was in stock with an expected delivery of two weeks.  Amazon now believes that the diaper bag will arrive at the end of February or early March.  This is also a product that is supposedly sold directly through Amazon.  One would think that they would have better inventory control over their own merchandise, but apparently not.",1
Just One Year Bouncer,"My baby really likes this. It\'s really soft, and the toys are cute and fun. I like that the toys can come off also so she can play with them.",5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Puma","I absolutely love this seat. The Britax seats I\'ve purchased have been my absolute favorite. The print is so cute. The cover is so soft. Installation is a breeze compared to other seats. Buckling the seat is easy enough for my 3 year old to do. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 is lack of cup holders. My daughters have seats w cup holders and having those is so awesome. If you\'re on the fence about this seat, don\'t be. It is a great, great seat!",4
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Toy,"I love the Einstein toys and this is no exception.  My daughter is 6 months old and likes to listen to the music, look into the mirror, and chew on the fins.  The only problem I have is that it is a little heavy for her to pick up yet.  But as you can see in the picture I submitted, she likes playing with it on level ground just fine.",4
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Toy,"Grandma was delighted to give this to our little boy for Christmas when he was 3 months old.  He fell in love with it and ""Neptune"" is the go-to toy to get his attention.  I\'ve seen him closely examine the crinkly parts, play with the little plastic beads.  More recently he\'s started teething at 7 months and chews on the soft plastic yellow fish.  He loves it.Unfortunately, I\'m here because I have to buy another one and its the primary reason that it isn\'t getting 5 stars.  Five months after he has gotten it, Neptune died and the music doesn\'t play anymore (yes, I changed the batteries AND correctly).  The music started becoming distorted, so I knew this day was coming.  The other downside is that you can\'t put it in the washing machine and the center part that plays the music is hard to push to make it play.His attention should be spread out to other things and he is getting along just fine without it, Neptune however makes him light up so I plan to buy another one.",4
Aura Select Travel System &#150; Sierra (5501616A),"We have had this carseat since 2006, and I hate it.  The stroller is ok for the most part.  Everyone said to get a carseat with the z-handle, so we did.  I don\'t know if I like the handle or not, because it is such a heavy carseat to lug around that the handle hardly seems to make a difference.  It doesn\'t fit my kids very well for whatever reason....they are both long-waisted though, so maybe that is why.  We have had a lot of trouble getting the base to remain ""safe"" in the car.  Also, the straps are a little hard to adjust- I\'ve gotten better at it with all the practice from two kids, but still....The stroller is also big and bulky, although I love the storage it has, and it has held up pretty well (we have not been gentle to it!) overall.  But yes, the carseat is not so great.  Perhaps the newer models have improved, since they seem smaller and hopefully a lot less heavy.",2
Aura Select Travel System &#150; Sierra (5501616A),The stroller in this travel system is pretty good but I have a problem with the car seat. I find it very difficult to adjust the straps to keep them fitting snugly on my daughter. To start with you have to adjust them in the back which is awkward to reach anyway (especially in the car) and it takes so much strength to pull them tighter it\'s almost impossible for me to do (loosening them is easy enough). Even my husband has a very hard time tightening the straps. I would recommend getting a car seat that allows you to adjust the tightness of the straps easily in the front.,3
Evenflo Simple Effort Metal Gate Taupe,"We bought two of these gates for our house.  They worked wonderfully for a few weeks.  Then one button started to open both gates.  We reset the gates and they worked again for a few hours and then the other button started to open both gates.  Once when one button opened both gates, our baby made it out of the family room and into the foyer area and halfway up the stairs before we found her ... luckily before she had fallen and hurt herself.  After a number of phone calls with Evenflo, I was finally told that there is no way to get the gates to work correctly in close proximity to each other (ours are about 25 feet apart).  We will be replacing one of the gates.  This seems like a huge liability for Evenflo and I\'m suprised that they don\'t make it more clear that this is an issue.",4
Evenflo Simple Effort Metal Gate Taupe,"I bought two Evenflo Simple Effort gates for my kitchen and hall entryways, to occasionally restrict my new 9 mo. old dog from certain parts of the house.  Having a ""door"" on the gate has provided ease without having to climb over the gate (and fear of falling).  It was simple to set up and being a pressure gate allows me to easily move it if I want to. What a dream come true--well worth the money.  And for fun, the remote control door opener is in my living room to automatically open the gate to let the dog out of the kitchen--pretty nifty!",5
Evenflo Simple Effort Metal Gate Taupe,"We tried three other brands and types of gates on the market. Two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing $66! The two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install. This Evenflo Gate was put together, installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs haven\'t been able to budge it one inch. Plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls. Great product at a bargain price - we\'re ordering three more! (Oct 2006)Review update - Jan 2009 - I am SHOCKED at the increase in price for these gates. When I bought them in 2006, I paid $48 each and now they are almost $80. That\'s just insane!",5
Evenflo Simple Effort Metal Gate Taupe,"This gate works just fine; however, my 2.5 year old stuck his leg through the bars during a game of hide n\' go seek with the sitter and she had to call 911 to have the fire department get him out.  He weighs 30 lbs.",3
Evenflo Simple Effort Metal Gate Taupe,"This gate has some good points and just one negative.Pros - good price, easy to operate. Mine are very easy on the batteries, I replace them about every 2 months. They are located on the kid\'s bedroom doorways, about 8\' apart from each other. We use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs, and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister\'s room when she wants some quiet time.For those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both. So simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other, then set up the second gate seperately. I have never had them malfunction following these steps.Cons:I also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door. I found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough. It was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back. We nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this. But since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems. It has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are..right down to bare wood. I will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down. The also should be a little taller IMO, and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open. Always check the gate when you close it to make sure it IS closed..a few rare occasions I have found it not completely closed. This usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it.Overall, 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching. Good price though and it is put together well.",4
The First Years Premium Single Electric Breast Pump,I bought this a s a gift for someone. They really appreciated it,5
The First Years Premium Single Electric Breast Pump,"i am usually one of those people who thinks that just because something is less expensive doesn\'t mean it is worse than something else. But I was wrong with this breast pump. First off, it is so loud, I have actually woken my baby in the night when i have used it and he is a very good sleeper. Also, it is super bulky- it is a big case to drag along everywhere on top of all the other things you have to carry around. Third, it is PAINFUL to pump! OMG  it hurts! if you put on low setting, you never get milk so you have to turn it up and then it is painful. it has ridged suction cup and every time i have marks on my breast for up to an hour after. i have actually chosen engorgement over this pump before and have also woken my son to have him feed to relieve me instead. if you can\'t afford a fancy eletric one- go with a manual- i got one and it is much less painful!",1
The First Years Premium Single Electric Breast Pump,"My wife is really happy with this product, since it has different level of suction, second comes with a lot of different, very useful, products along, and  finally you can carry it anywhere since it comes with its own carrying bag.We are using it in Chile (220v), son we just needed a very simple current adaptor and worked just fine.",5
The First Years Premium Single Electric Breast Pump,I was absloutley blown away by how huge & heavy this pump was! I never even used it returned it right away. I bought it to help with nursing my 2nd child. The pump I had with my 1st child was electric very compact I could put it right in the diaper bag no problem. This one is a whole another diaper bag in itself! The description I felt was misleading. I would have never purchased it if there was mention of hoses and heavy motors(which it does state very clearly on the box)I don\'t know why the seller did not mention these key facts in the product description. I am very surprised it got as many good reveiws as it did. It make be an ok pump for a mother who doesn\'t pump much or stays at home most of the time. I do not recommend this product for a working or active mom.,1
The First Years Premium Single Electric Breast Pump,I had purchased a hand pump.They are fine if you need to pump occassionally. I needed one for everyday use. I thought it was expensive but it was so worth it! I found it easy to use. It worked fast and my hand didn\'t hurt like the hand pump. It was easy to take to work.It was easy to clean and I would highly recommend this one.If I had to buy another one I would get the double one for quicker pumpimg time.,5
The First Years Premium Single Electric Breast Pump,"DO NOT ORDER!!! PLEASE READ FIRST. I know what you might be thinking... Reading reviews and thinking that its not that bad of a product. When we read them we noticed that the product either worked or was defective but that if the product worked it was good. Now we are out $50. So as most women who are having a baby do I prepared and ordered all my baby stuff a little early and the pump was a part of that order (about 60 days from my due date). I was unable to test it obviously because I hadn\'t had the baby yet and my milk wasn\'t in. So when it came time to use the pump it fizzled out and broke leaving burn marks in the suction tube! FIRST TIME I WENT TO USE IT. We immediately called the company to request a refund and the asked us to submit an email. Ok, no problem right? So we submit the email request. The company never responded over a period of two weeks. We called to see what was going on and the lady on the phone told us we could not have a refund NO MATTER WHAT since we were over the 30 day from purchase period. It was exactly 49 days from the time we ordered it to the time we made the request. REALLY? COME ON... REALLY? She told us that we should have tested the product as soon as we got it... to which our response was that wouldn\'t have been possible since we had no breasts availible that had milk in them :) She said ""that is irrelivant to our company\'s policy"". So for being responsible adults and ordering baby stuff a little bit early to be prepared we got stuck with a broken pump. It didn\'t matter at all to the company that they had sold a product that was completely defective and actually could have hurt someone considering the look of those burn marks. Judging by other reviews on this product it looks like a high number of them are defective and don\'t work at all, I would venture to guess at least 10% of all pumps from this company. That combined with the aweful/upsetting level of customer service given and complete lack of caring would make it an easy decision to not buy this product. TRUST US GET ONE WITH BETTER REVIEWS, IT WILL BE WORTH THE EXTRA $20. DO NOT BUY ""The First Years"" Products.",1
The First Years Soothie 9 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,These bottles are great!The reason for the 4 stars is because they do leak if the cover isn\'t on right and size of the bottle is odd. They come in 5 & 9oz sizes. I use powdered formula so you can\'t make an odd numbered amount. (Too much or too little formula isn\'t good for the baby\'s brain development so it\'s best to use the full scoop rather than half to make odd numbered ounces. At least that\'s what I was told by my doctor! :) The starter set comes in a 5oz size but now that my son drinks 6ozs I can\'t really use the 5oz bottles unless I measure 6oz of water in another bottle then transfer it. It\'s a hassle since 6oz almost reaches the top so when placing the powder in it sometimes spills.Other than that...I love these bottles!,4
The First Years Soothie 9 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,I love these bottles and so does the baby. It\'s the only brand we use.,5
The First Years Soothie 9 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,very pleased with everything... my little man feeds so much better with these bottles... we tried the avent bottles first and they leak all over... it was a mess and he hated drinking from them... glad we found a good match for our little guy.,5
Evenflo Embrace Infant Car Seat- Sierra,This car seat was a last minute buy as the one we bought was supposed go either way. The price was right and it came faster than expexted. It clicks in and out with great ease and is used as an infant seat in the house. Would buy it again. Geraldine Levesque,5
The First Years Soothie 5 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,"I went through playtex, EvenFlow, and Dr. Browns (which i cannot stand...to much to clean and the parts are just agravating! Not to mention the paint on the bottle chips off easy and bugs me), ...and sadly all those bottles didn\'t work... Because we all know how expensive bottles can get! I love first years products. I have no pacifer or nipple confusion b/c i use different pacifers. He loves these bottles... We were having problems with a too fast flow or not fast enough. These are just perfect! Thank you first years!",5
The First Years Soothie 5 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,"Love it!  Love it!  My 5 month old has been breastfed with an occasional bottle.  I decided to move her to bottle only, and she refused any kind of bottle.  I tried Avent, Playtex Nurser, Evenflo Elan, and Gerber.  I even tried different flows and materials of some of these bottles.  I tried them over and over again, but when I tried the Soothie, she took it the very first time and hasn\'t even complained.  What a relief!!!!  Besides being relieved that she will take the Soothie, they are also very inexpensive, which is another plus.",5
The First Years Soothie 5 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,"We think this bottle is a poor design.  It\'s too wide for a newborn baby.  Like another reviewer said, it smooshes up against the baby\'s nose and you have to tilt the bottle way too far to get the last few ounces of milk to the nipple.  In addition, the vent does not seem to work as the only way air gets back into the bottle is when the baby stops sucking and releases the nipple.  We like the playtex drop-ins better.",1
The First Years Soothie 5 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,"I JUST LOVE THIS BOTTLES AND MY 2 WEEK OLD BABY DOES TOO. THEY ARE SUPER EASY TO FILL DURING DOES LATE NIGHT FEEDINGS BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE OPENING, EVEN IF YOU ARE HALF A SLEEP. VERY CONFORTABLE TO GRAB. I HAVEN\'T HAD PROBLEMS WITH ANY LEAKING, WE JUST LOVE THEM.",5
The First Years Soothie 5 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,"I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn\'t flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems.",4
The First Years Soothie 5 oz. Bottles 3 pk.,My daughter was being breastfed and given a bottle supplement since day 1 due to her low birth weight. She got use to the disposable nipples and bottles the hospital gave us but ofcourse I wanted to switch her up to regular bottles. My lactation consultant suggested the Breastflow also from first years because they simulate breastfeeding but she did not take to these bottles. They would drip all over her face and on her clothes and she would scream bloody murder everytime my husband would try to give her the bottle for her once a day bottle feed. We switched to Avent and once again my daugher screamed everytime we tried to feed her. Since she likes the soothie pacifier I found these at Wal-Mart and decided to try them. My daughter LOVES these bottles and I don\'t seem to have the leaking problem like others do. Also these bottles are a breeze to clean. These bottles are great. Wal-Mart also sells them with Winnie the Pooh characters on them. Very cute!,5
En Point 6 Piece Crib Set,"I fell in love with this set when I first saw it. I looked in Burlington Coat Factory\'s Baby Depot and they have a set almost exactly the same except it has castles and crowns and is called camelot. The ruffle is also different. I would still recommend this set, but there is an alternative if you can\'t get to Babies r Us.",5
En Point 6 Piece Crib Set,"this is a great bedding set for a girls room, it offers so many different colors to work with. this set is also made very well.the matching drapes are also now available for special order at babies r us.this is perfect for anyone who loves ballarinas and princess rooms.",5
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","This is the second flex loc infant car seat that we have purchased. I love this car seat. The triangular carry handle makes it very easy to grip on to. We purchased our first one three years ago for our son in green, gray and silver. This second time around I looked around and did my research all over again and found that I still like this one. The rear facing and then forward facing options are great. You do not have to purchase another seat after they get big enough to face forward but still need to be carried in the car seat at times.",5
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.Pros:-very comfy seat, good padding-the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely- the canopy stays in place; it doesn\'t fall forward or backward behind the seat- the tightening mechanism under the baby\'s feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it\'s a breeze.- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my EvenfloCons:I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It\'s a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.- The handle is thinner and doesn\'t FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn\'t had any problems-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I\'m still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo\'s was, so maybe that\'s why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I\'ll take the corners slower!Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it.",4
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","This is my 3rd baby, and this is by far the best infant car seat I\'ve owned. The latch system is heavy duty and makes me feel so secure. My favorite is the enclosure at the baby\'s feet. I hated how baby could kick off socks and shoes in other seat\'s, and this also gives a protection from the elements. The handle is also comfortable. The seat is slender and easily fits between my toddlers front facing seat and my 4 year olds big boy seat. CAN\'T SAY ENOUGH HOW THIS IS THE BEST VALUE AND QUALITY FOR YOUR DOLLAR.....",5
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer",We bought this because of the good safety reveiws. We also liked it because it is nice looking. We get comments on how nice it looks. I don\'t recommend it to people because of the handle. It\'s VERY hard to put up and down. You have to crawl in the car and grab the release with both hands while pulling back and wrestling with it to get it to go down. Not very easy if you have small hands. My husband even has trouble with it sometimes. Also if it is raining and you are trying to get the baby in the car and the handle down you will get soaked. It\'s not a fast chore. Other than that it looks nice but I probably would get something different.,3
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer",4 stars because base doesn\'t tighten down using the latch system only with seatbelt. absolutely adore and treasure the seat itself!,4
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","The only reason I have a 4 star review instead of 5 is that handle. And possibly it\'s weight.I hear so many people say they LOVE the triangle handle. I really don\'t like it! But it could be because I had a natural inability to carry a car seat. They\'re too heavy. Too bulky. My husband loves the handles! He hooks them on his arms somehow and hauls the twins around like it\'s nobody\'s business. Me, I have one with one hand... two hands... to my side... to my front... no matter what, I don\'t know what to do with that handle!! I just have a love-hate relationship to infant carseats, I guess. :)SO EASY to use. Easy to adjust the straps. SO nice to be able to turn a knob in the back and raise the shoulder straps. This car seat is just awesome! :)Also, I love that there is a \'window\' on the bottom of these seats that show you how it should be tilted. SO NICE!They\'re incredibly easy to snap on and off of the base. Sometimes I struggle with getting car seats unhooked from the base, but it\'s ridiculously simple to take these off!Not going to lie, though, I can\'t wait to buy convertible carseats once we get our tax returns so I don\'t have to carry around 600 pounds of baby+seat anymore. ;)In a nutshell - if you buy it, I think you\'re really going to like it. :) REALLY easy to use. Plush, and seems incredibly safe. Easy to get in and out. The stronger you are, the better. ;)",4
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","My daughter was 25""long and 14lbs at 2 months so she out grew her infant carseat FAST. I wasn\'t ready for her to be in a convertable carseat yet, so I started on my searching for a hopefully longer infant seat... when I came across this one! I bought it right away because of the weight and height limit. It is the best carseat EVER! It is very simple to adjust the straps, you simply twist a knob that actually extends the back of the seat, So Cool!! I have read reviews on this saying that it didn\'t come with instructions, But they do they are in a slot underneith the carseat (not the base).She is now 4 months and 26"" and 16lbs and I know she will still have quite a few more months in this carseat :)",5
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","For our second child we bought this car seat (previously had a Graco) to fit into the matching Sit N Stand double stroller.  Wish I found another seat that also fits, even if it won\'t be the same color.  Great safety ratings, the triangle handle looks weird but I thought was comfortable, and easy to clean.  However, it is very difficult to move the handle back (which you\'re supposed to do for safety) once you put the baby in the car.  It takes a few tries to get it to move and is a real hassle.  The strap length isn\'t very long either and my baby only weighs 13 pounds.I agree with other reviewers and would not buy this again despite the convenience of fitting well with my new carriage by the same brand (which I love and highly recommend).",2
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","This seat is narrow and compact and fits well in a three-across the back situation like we have... but it is a royal pain to get buckled! the plastic buckles must line up perfectly and couple fully  before being secured in the crotch buckle. Hard to do if baby is squirming at all, not completely seated with tail bone ALL the way back in seat, wearing bulky sweats/full pee diaper, etc.  It made me miss our Graco snug ride that could be buckled with one hand, with its two male buckle teeth that could be clicked one at a time.  Its also difficult to tighten and loosen.  Also that whole triangle handle thing is a bit of a joke- infant seats are freaking heavy and impossible to hold in any other way besides the crook of one\'s elbow.",2
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby\'s low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby\'s buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby\'s backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I\'m not going to take any chances.  Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.",2
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer",Overall we really like this car seat.  The only problem we have with it is that the handle to release the seat from the base is located in the front of the seat.  This makes it extremely difficult to release the seat if the base is latched snugly into your car (as it should be!)  Bit of a bad design move if you ask me.,4
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","We bought this carseat when we were pregnant with our first child. We used it for for our first three children and it was adequate. We were never in an accident so I can not speak to its safety. The reasons I did not purchase another like it when this one expired was that we found it very difficult to get the handle pushed back on it (the buttons were difficult to press) and it was a bit hard to adjust the straps for a growing baby. We purchased a Chicco Keyfit 30 for our latest addition and have been very happy with it, the issues that we had with the babytrend have been nonexistent with the chicco.",3
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,"I bought this several years ago for my infant son.  we were going on our first family vacation and were going to be out with our stroller in the sun most of the time.  The canopy on my jogging stroller doesn\'t really extend that far and this sunshade does a good job of really protecting him from the heat. I have also used it to protect him from the wind as well. It attaches easily and can be adjusted easily.  The only down side is trying to get it back into the carry bag it comes with because its floppy, Im sure someone with more patience than me wont have any issues with it, but it\'s pretty comical to see me wrestle this thing to finally just wad it up and shove it in the bag.",4
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,"I like this product. It works as promised. I have a Jogging stroller and this item works great with the frame (baby trend). My girlfriend purchased this too but returned it as she did not like it for her phil and ted\'s stroller. the frame and ties did not match up well - she likes the shade that comes with that brand.Back to protect-a-bubit seems hard to work with at first, but if you fool with it - and give yourself time (not when you expect to go for a walk) to try it out - you\'ll love it.I have the 3 position shade and all work well. My baby fusses when the shade is down unless i adjust it so he can see out - again, just tinkering with the stroller and item to figure out what works best for you.i live in chicago - and we get some serious wind around these streets and the protect - a - bub stays on and does not blow around like others - i think because it\'s breathable.the material is soft and stretchy. the shaping wire (or whatever is used to create the curved shape) is flexible which is nice for adjusting it or not breaking it.I have not used the dark over/3rd postion, it just seems too much or in the summer when your strolling around, like it will be too hot. I\'m sure i\'ll use it in the winter.",4
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,"I am so happy with this 3-in-1 sunshade.  It is easy to put on, easy to use and easy to adjust from full coverage to top coverage.  My baby was bothered by the sun in her eyes and would wake up if the sun was shining on her face.  I do not like the idea of putting sunblock on her sensitive skin, so this sunshade is the perfect solution.  This is a must have in Southern California.",5
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,"We used this a lot in our first summer with our daughter as she was sensitive to the sun as a lot of new babies are.  It allows the air to flow freely through it, versatile and adaptable to most if not all strollers.  Later on as our daughter grew bigger, she would play with it too, constantly pulling on it.  I would say you will not use it much after your child grows past the 6 month mark.",4
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,I love this shade.  You can pull it out so the baby stays well protected from the sun.  I don\'t have to worry about putting sunscreen on him.  The sun doesn\'t get in his eyes or make him get too hot.,5
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,It provides all the necessary protection to my little one. She falls asleep in her stroller easily after I put this sunshade on. It gives the perfect shade that she needs to take a nap while we are outside.,5
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,I have the Guzzie and Guss 102 full size stroller and this fits perfect. I love that I can pull it down and protect my LO from sun but she can still see through- then lay the flap down when shes napping to keep it dark ;) Everything I thought it would be and more!!! My only complaint is I paid a higher price and it went on sale 2wks later! Ack. Oh well- still well worth it!,5
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,Does not fit our jogging stroller; falls off during use all the time; doesn\'t serve it\'s purpose; badly made unlike the clear one for rain and wind..,1
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Twin - Black,"I have a baby jogger city mini double stroller. The protect-a-bub sun coverage would be good, but it is kind of unwieldy and does not fit that well on my stroller model. It might work better for other models.",2
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Twin - Black,"Our stroller (strolair) had an umbrella that was very annoying to use and never really did the job of blocking out the sun as much as was needed.  This sunshade was lifesaver!  Very convenient, and compact.  It fits in a tiny bag and will fit any stroller.  I only wish I didn\'t choose it in black, but even in this color I didn\'t notice it heat up too much on the sun.  Would be nice if there were more light, bright, fun colors for this product.",5
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Twin - Black,"Not sure why it\'s hard to find such a good stroller cover. I do really like this one, and have had people ask me where I got it.Why I like it...- Good size - covers my Graco Fast Action Jogging stroller well.- Has netting and solid fabric... provides great protection from the sun. Only my baby\'s feet peek out... less sun screen to slather on her!- Option to be just a larger shade, or go over the baby like a screen. Both come in handy.- Folds up pretty small for storageWhat could be better..- When you use it as a larger shade, can flip back in the wind or when going over bumps- Minor, but I\'d prefer a different color since my stroller is black",4
Graco Cleo Single Stroller - Truffle,"I needed a new stroller to replace a travel system.  I wanted something smaller, but still with some features - cup holder, basket, etc.  I chose this one because being taller the handle was a good height.  It does fold down to a great size.  Now the problems - I have to put the brake on to fold it up and that\'s a two step process.  It is not easy.  The latch doesn\'t work very well - it certainly doesn\'t latch the other side of the stroller, so it does ""open up"" when you\'re transporting it.  It does not have shocks on the back, so it shakes up the drink in the holder pretty good.  And last, but not least are the handles - I thought at first they were pretty cool, but they\'re not functional at all.  I\'m used to being able to push a stroller with one hand.  Because the handles are not connected, you cannot maneuver it with one hand, so you have to stop to do anything - ie: take a drink. If in need of a compact stroller, I would look elsewhere.More - I bought this 6 weeks ago - I would now give it one star.  The tread on the back wheels are already gone.  The wheels are also squeaking.  Time to move the front wheels to the back (if we can) and get the WD-40 out.",2
Graco Cleo Single Stroller - Truffle,"We like this stroller because:-It\'s very light and easy to maneuver-It folds up very small-It\'s comfortable to push-It is affordable.-It looks sharp.-The carseat hides stains.We don\'t like this stroller because:-It doesn\'t take bumps well at ALL.  First time we went over a bump in it with out newborn son, I thought he was going to get whiplash.-It squeeks after only a few months of use.-It\'s takes practice to unfold it without a struggle.-The carseat makes my son hot if the sun is shining on him.-It doesn\'t seem like it\'s going to last us more than one child.",4
Graco Cleo Single Stroller - Truffle,I bought this stroller at Target while they were having a big sale so I only paid $49 for it!!! So for the money I paid for it I love it and think it is worth every penny although there are somethings that I do not care for. I do not the fact that there is no tray for the baby..it\'s just a bar that goes across?? I also find it kind of hard to sit my son all the way in this seat since you have to pull the string in the back and I can\'t get it to where I want it so he sits pretty much laying down. I also don\'t like the canopy I think they should have made it bigger so that the baby gets protected more. And I also wish that the basket was a little bit larger but other than those few minor complaints I love this stroller. It is lightweight enough for me to carry up 3 flights of stairs since I live in a 3rd floor apartment. It take up very little room in both the trunk and in the house. I use this stroller around the house alot since my son is not yet sitting up on his own yet and is very heavy to carry with me it makes it convenient for me to just wheel him into the room. and it is small enough to manuver around the house. I also like that the stroller handles are alot higher than other strollers so its easier on my back when we go for walks. So I do recommend this stroller for light travel like walks or shopping but when we go out on an all day trip or are doing alot of shopping we usually bring our bigger stroller.,4

Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,don\'t buy - go for the city mini if budget allows. this stroller has manueverablity & is clunky...,1
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"My wife and I have been quite pleased with our BabyTrend Snap-and-Go stroller and FlexLoc Infant Car Seat. We have used these items since our daughter came home from the hospital over four months ago, so this review is based on quite a bit of use.We concur with others who have noted the portability and foldability of the stroller. We have found the stroller/carseat combo to be quite easy to travel with on both car and plane trips. The car seat, while a bit challenging to get out of a car (owing to the difficulty of moving the bar from the ""ride"" position to the ""carry"" position -- it\'s too stiff), has proved comfortable and reliable. In fact, our daughter now prefers being in her car seat to being in any other contraption we own--crib, bouncer, and swing. She actually sleeps better in this car seat than in her crib!Unexpectedly, we use the stroller/carseat combo extensively in our home. It allows us to transport our daughter easily from room to room, to rock her to sleep (a gentle back and forth push works best), and to allow her to be part of the action wherever we are (it puts her closer to our level).All in all, I\'d highly recommend this stroller with the BabyTrend Flex Loc car seat. Since we use the stroller so much in the house, we are planning to buy a second unit so that we don\'t have to clean the wheels off every time we come in the house with it!",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,No ndeed to wake baby from car seat to get into stroller.  Just pick the car seat out of car and place in this infant seat carrier / stroller frame.  GREAT invention.  Received as a shower gift and it was greatly appreciated and used often!,5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,I love this stroller!  It is so nice to have a quick and practical way to transport the baby in the car seat.  I use this stroller almost every day and I wish we would have had it for all of our babies!,5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"You can tell by the price and the very basic features of this item that it\'s not a fancy, high-quality stroller, but that\'s not why you\'re buying it. You\'re buying it because you NEED this thing--it will save your arms from that cement-laced infant seat you\'re carting around the store with you because your baby fell asleep in it and there is NO WAY you\'re going to wake that baby up just to stick it in a Moby wrap. Trust me on this.Here are the pros:- It has cup holders and a little compartment on the console you can snap shut that you can store your keys or an extra pacifier in- As long as you\'re pushing it on a smooth surface, it handles nicely and pushes easily.- Baby is rear-facing, so you get to make eyes at her and address her needs while you walk.- There\'s a good size basket to store your diaper bag in with room to spare.- Car seat fits in snugly.- Stroller collapses and sets up easily and quickly--there\'s no learning curve on this one!- It\'s quite compact and easily fits in the trunk or back seat of your car.Cons:- My husband is tall, and the handle is just too far down for him. Even my sister in law who\'s 5\'9"" says she has to slump to reach it.- While the stroller is supposed to be a ""universal"" fit for infant seats, my car seat, the Chicco Keyfit 30, does not actually ""snap"" into the Snap N\' Go. It does slide right in and feels nice and stable--I\'ve never had a problem with it. Chicco does make their own (Chicco Keyfit Caddy Stroller Frame), but since this one was half the price, I opted for the cheapie.- If you want to access anything in the basket, it\'s almost a guarantee you\'ll have to remove the car seat first. I don\'t find this too big of an inconvenience most of the time.- If you\'re on anything rougher than smooth asphalt, you and your baby will feel the bumps.It\'s true that you won\'t use this stroller for more than a year (my daughter isn\'t even six months old yet and she already prefers her front-facingChicco Liteway Stroller, Moss), but you\'ll get a lot of use out of it those first few months. I used it almost every time I left the house, and I still use it when I need a light stroller for the store. I definitely consider this item a must-have for any new parent.",4
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"This is so worth the money! I purchased a very fancy, expensive stroller for my first child that we used a handful of times. This is all we needed. It\'s very light weight, so I can easily handle it with one hand in and out of the trunk. It folds up and down with one hand and my foot. It also has two nice size cup holders and a lidded storage area by the handle. The basket under is wonderfully large. It\'s very fast and easy to put my infant seat in and out. It\'s a life saver at the airport as well. I really believed I was going to love my super fancy expensive stroller before my kids were born, but this has been the best thing ever. I got it when my daughter was born, and I am still using it for my son.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,It is very reasonably priced and is very portable but i find that steering the stroller is very challenging.  It doesn\'t have very good turning capabilities.,3
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"I love this stroller! I have a Baby Trend car seat, and I truly just snap it on top of this and go. I really like the cup holders and compartment - it\'s great for tucking away keys and other items that you need to access right away. It has a very simple fold up mechanism - although it\'s not intuitive at first how to do it, once you figure it out it\'s easy. I would\'ve given it five stars, but I don\'t like how the wheels are pretty much useless when you fold up the stroller. I tried taking it on the bus once with the diaper bag still in the bottom - the wheels collapsed up and it just dragged the storage area along the ground. I also have a Kolcraft stroller, but it doesn\'t do this - the wheels still work when the stroller is folded up, so I know it\'s just a drawback to this particular stroller.",4
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"I bought this stroller at BabiesRUs - it was one of two brnads/models they had for sale. (The Amazon price is about $10 less than I paid.) I\'ve used this stroller many times and find it very easy to unfold/fold, the storage basket is ample, and the parent tray is convenient. I have no complaints at all with it. In fact, I had some paralysis in my hands as a result of my pregnancy, and I bought this stroller when I still couldn\'t move all of my fingers and my hands were very weak, and I could still fold it with one hand. It\'s very easy to use. I see that another reviewer had trouble with hers/his tipping over. I\'ve never felt this stroller is unstable. I\'ve used it with a Graco car seat and haven\'t had any trouble with its stability at all.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"I love this stroller, it was a lifesaver because as a disabled mom on crutches it is the easiest way for me to take my son to do any kind of errands/get him into/out of the house.  It is 15 lbs without the baby/infant seat, relatively easy for me to open and close with one hand.  I purchased one for about $50 and my only complaint is that there is not some type of snap in seat accessory for when your child no longer uses the infant seat.  I may be purchasing another baby trend stroller as he grows.  I also highly recommended the double stroller to a mom with twins on the way.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"Highly recommend this stroller.Light weight, easy to carry and store, both at home and in your car.Space saver and practical.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"This stroller frame is light weight, compact and very easy to open up and use. However, the steering/control is a real issue. I wish the manufacturer would look into this because I think it would be absolutely perfect if I could push the stroller, look away for a second and not run into the grass. We use this stroller mainly when we go for walks around the neighborhood. The problem we run into is when two pieces of sidewalk are not the same height we have to lift the front of the stroller to get over them. I\'m talking about maybe an inch difference in height. Most neighborhoods do not have perfect side walks so we are either lifting the stroller every 2 minutes or we\'re walking in the street.Other than that this stroller is really great. Some people seem concerned about the security of the stroller and yeah, if the stroller were to tip over I\'d be very concerned that the car seat would slip out. However, if you\'re doing normal walking and everything is tight like it\'s supposed to be I don\'t see how safety is a concern. I have never been worried about safety when I have my baby in this stroller. The belt is very tight and goes right under the little plastic hooks on my snugride.",4
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,wheels are cheap and it is not compact when folded I would go with the maclaren instead. I have both and now we never use this one,3
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"I am a first time mom so in the beginning I did not know how to choose a stroller. My friend recommended the baby trend snap N go stroller. I go out for a walk with my baby everyday. I have used it for almost 4 months now. I have never bought any other stroller before so I can not compare if this one is more light weight than others. However, the worst thing of this stroller is when you go to some slightly uneven pavement, the stroller is not very stable and sometimes it can statle your baby. There is only one bar to secure the car seat. I don\'t feel very secure going with my baby in this stroller. There is also some problem with the wheels. If you are going straight, it\'s fine. But when you want to turn left or right, you need tremendous maneuver to push the stroller. I would not recommend this stroller.",1
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"I bought this for my daughter after borrowing my sister in law\'s on a walk. We had been using the large and cumbersome stroller that came with our Chicco Keyfit 30 travel system and it takes up so much space in the trunk of our car it\'s insane (and we have a trunk big enough to fit a 250lb 5\'11"" man in there semi comfortably!). So after using my sister in law\'s almost 3 year old snap n go stroller I decided I needed one... NOW!This thing has been great. I can leave it in the trunk of my car, and just use the big stroller for walks at home around the community. I love that the cup holder tray has a compartment for my keys or cell phone. you can open the stroller single handed as you\'re pulling it out of the trunk and it will lock into place on it\'s own.There are a few things I wish were part of the stroller, like the snap in feature that the bigger stroller has instead of the strap to attach the car seat to the frame. This would be a huge thing, as when you\'re unfolding the stroller you have to mind that the straps do not get stuck in the ""hinge"" areas and make it difficult to strap baby in. I also wish that the basket on the bottom was turned around. It\'s kind of silly to either have to lift the car seat up to access the basket, or go to the front of the stroller. A little bit more thought should have gone into that part of it.Overall I am really excited about this stroller. We will be making a trip from TX to CA in the coming months, and this will make traveling through the airport and around town much easier.UPDATE: 10/01/12 - We had to make a trip to CA early for the funeral of my mother in law, and this stroller was so easy to travel with, and go through security with at the airport. It folded easy for screening, and gate checking. It was much easier manuvering the airport security lines and the crowded Dallas and San Francisco airports with this smaller stroller than it would have been with the bulky Chicco stroller we have.It also fit very well into the trunk of our rental car, and still allowed room for all of our luggage (3 large bags for 4 days for the 3 of us!) - I would recommend this stroller frame to anyone looking for something a little simpler than the standard stroller while their child is still in a car seat.",4
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"We found ourselves at the airport and realized we forgot our daughter\'s stroller.  I had a car seat and that was it, and she was only 8 wks old.  We found this and were so relieved when our Chicco Keyfit30 car seat fit! We took it on the plane and it passed for a ""one item travel system,"" so we didn\'t have additional charges. It has a pretty big basket, but you have to lift the car seat up to fit larger items in it.  But I use it now in our smaller car, that has zero trunk space, because it folds up so well.  There are no bells and whistles, but it gets the job done and is lightweight and small for travel or a quick stop into a store when you want to leave baby in the car seat.",4
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"I have the Chicco keyfit 30, which is a great car seat, but rather heavy.  This makes my snap n go indispensable.  It isn\'t the equivalent of a high end stroller of course, but its pretty sturdy, and quite light.  One of the reviewers complained that the keyfit isn\'t compatible, that the seat gets scratched by the stroller.  If used properly (there are little red tabs which have to adjusted to a larger car seat like the keyfit 30), it may still cause the most superficial of scratches, but certainly doesn\'t endanger the integrity of the seat.  I agree with the complaints that you have to go around to the front of the stroller to get things in and out of the lower basket, but this is a minor complaint.  It handles pretty well.  It takes some assembly, but nothing too complicated.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N\' Go Stroller,"I received the Snap N\' Go as a shower gift and have loved it for 6 months and counting!  It was super easy to assemble, but that\'s just the beginning of its benefits.  We use it with the Chicco Keyfit 30 carseat and it fits perfectly.  Living in the city makes it hard to lug around a large stroller (in fact, I still have the Chicco Cortina stroller in its box!), but the Snap N\' Go is lightweight and easy to maneuver.  In addition, it fits well in my midsize sedan\'s trunk with tons of room to spare.  I also love the cup-holders for my *cold* coffee and the little compartment for my keys.  Great features for a fabulous price. . .highly, highly recommended!",5
Graco Family Tree Play Yard,"I love Graco products and this one has the same great quality and value you would expect from Graco.We used this as a bassinet in our room when the baby was just born, and now we use it when traveling and staying at hotels or people\'s houses.The only drawback of this particular one is it seems larger than other Graco  Pack \'n\' Plays I\'ve seen.  If I had to buy a new one, I would still get Graco, but maybe look for a smaller model.",4
Baby Trend Expedition Jogging Stroller,"Baby Trend Expedition LX Jogging Stroller, SkylarI bought this stroller less then 6 months ago and now we are looking to purchase a differnt one. It was for our first child and we decided to buy the entire travel system. The car seat portion has been fine but the stroller itself has been a big disapointment.  First of all we were looking for a stroller that would work well in most terrain, as we are very active people. It is very tippy even on a regular sidewalk. Second, it is not ment for jogging or even a fast walk. It wobbles all over the place and is very annoying. If I were looking to purchase a Jogging stroller again I would definatly spend a little more money and get a quality stroller. This was not what I was looking for.",3
Baby Trend Expedition Jogging Stroller,"I have had this stroller for about a year now, and it\'s really great. I am not a runner, but I use it for daily walks in the neighborhood where sidewalks are uneven and sometimes broken.  It handles very well.  I have also used it at the beach, where it was also great.  The stroller is light-weight and maneuvers like most jogging strollers with fixed front wheels.  I also have a double jogger whose front tire swivels, and that one is much easier to turn.The basket under the seat is very roomy, plus it has another large pocket on the back of the seat and little zippered pockets in the shade.  The shade adjusts all the way to the front and back making it very easy to keep little ones out of the sun.I use this stroller a lot, and it has really held up well.  Aside from some rusting, which I attribute to the beach use, I have had no problems at all.",5
Baby Trend Chatham Sit N\' Stand Stroller,"I bought this stroller so that I could resume walking on a daily basis now that summer is here. I considered buying a double jogger stroller, but decided to get this one so that I would be able to use it indoors as well. I wanted something that would be pretty all-purpose. I liked the low price of this stroller since my older child is too old to really use it for more than about a year.Overall this stroller is very nice. It doesn\'t have any real major problems.The front seat is very soft and comfortable. Its sits straight upright when it is up, which is nice (my baby always want to sit straight up to see out). It reclines enough for an older baby to take a nap, but not to be laying down. I also like that when it is reclined and the baby is seat belted, he cannot sit himself up (very important when trying to get baby to nap!). The child tray is very sturdy plastic and can rotate open instead of having to be completely removed. The canopy works fine. The only problem with the front seat is that the back is pretty short. My 9-month-old\'s head is already level to the top so I don\'t know how he\'ll take a nap in it a few months from now.My 4-year old loves being able to sit or stand at will. He thinks riding in this stroller is fun, which is good. I do feel the older child\'s space is kind of long and could be more compact. The entire stroller is longer than I hoped and it is mainly because the older child has more room than he needs. My son is 43 inches tall (over the recommended height limit) and he has PLENTY of room.The main problem I have with the stroller is that the handlebar is too narrow. I feel like my hands need to be farther apart in order to control and steer the stroller better. The parent tray is very nice can fit two 24-oz bottles of pop, unlike many trays. I also like the little part in the middle that can hold my garage door opener inside. The basket can really only be accessed by opening the snap on one side, which takes a little longer.  The stroller folds easilly and more compactly than I expected.",4
Baby Trend Chatham Sit N\' Stand Stroller,"My wife and I are very happy owners of both the Latch-loc infant carseat and the Snap-n-go stroller base, both from Baby Trend.  For that reason, we were pretty excited when we got a hand-me-down Sit-n-stand LX from a friend.  Our toddler is 22 months and our infant is 4 months, so we could use a double stroller.  However, this thing has problems.  First, when the infant carseat is in its position in the front and nobody\'s on the back, the assembly is very close to falling forward on the infant seat.  The heavy infant seat hangs out farther than the front wheels, so it is (dangerously?) unstable.  Second, the rear seat is rearward-facing, so your young family looks like a two-baby crew team out there, with nobody facing forward.  On the other hand, if the toddler stands and faces forward, he is in the perfect position to throw things at the infant.  Finally, my toddler didn\'t find anything he identified as a seat, and ended up wanting to stand on the back, hold on to the handle, and lean back at a 30 degree angle until his grip almost failed and he suddenly stepped off the back of the moving stroller, or fell on his rear in the road.  A little teaching would probably help that point, but it seems that a seat that isn\'t very good at keeping the toddler in place is certainly not one to depend on to counterbalance the infant seat in front.  Overall, I definitely would not recommend this for anyone with a young infant.",1
Baby Trend Chatham Sit N\' Stand Stroller,"My 3 year old loves this stroller almost as much as I do.  She loves being a ""big girl"".  And I can strap her in when I need to.  I would highly recommend this stroller.",5
Primo Viaggio SIP,"I bought this car seat to match my Perego Venezia, and am extremely dissapointed. After everything I heard about how wonderful Perego merchandise is and my own experience (the Venezia is excellent, and the Prima Pappa highchair is a dream), this is quite a let down. My son was born 8lb 10oz at which point he fit quite nicely - without the newborn cushioning! Now at 4 months and almost 18 lb, he has outgrown it. He overheats in it as the seat is so narrow, and is uncomfortable after more than a half an hour, not able to recline more comfortably. I would reccomend the Graco Snugride for a first timer, and at this point we are moving into the Britax Roundabout. I\'m sorry to leave my Snap\'n\'go this early in my sons life though simply because the car seat is just too small. Perego needs to update itself some more in its car seat department!",2
Primo Viaggio SIP,"As with most safety related baby merchandise, we purchased our Primo Viaggio based on its excellent review in Consumer Reports.  My guess is that the folks at CR never tested the seat with an actual baby in it.  Our 3 month old cried constantly whenever we put him in this seat.  Normally he is a very happy, mellow kid.  He is always smiling and happy. But as soon as we put him in this seat, he begins to fuss and by the time we are pulling out of the driveway he is in full wail.  For the first couple of months, we didn\'t even think to attribute it to the car seat.  My wife would even put off or completely avoid trips in the car because she felt so bad about how uncomfortable he felt.  We happened to have an extra, unused, Graco car seat laying around and one day we decided to give it a try to see if it made any difference.  WOW!!!.  It was like night and day.  We put him in that seat and he smiled away. I should also mention that the Graco seems to weigh about half as much as the Primo.  Now car trips are filled with the pleasant sounds of his happy burbles instead of the anguished cries we heard while he was in the Peg Perego.",2
Primo Viaggio SIP,"I bought his car seat for my baby who was a preemie and only weighed 5 pounds. Though I have read all the negative feedback, I highly recommend this product. Not only is it stylish but my baby falls right to bed as soon as he gets put in. As for the sweating I have experienced none with my baby.",4
Primo Viaggio SIP,"i am a new mom of a 4 month old boy. we got this car seat based on no experience with children. i liked the way it looked, and all the car seats looked the same to me, anyway! our son hates this car seat. he cries almost every time we put him in it, i suppose because it is not comfortable for him. he is only 15 lbs. and already seems to be too big for it, even though it is supposed to go up to 22 lbs. it is awkward and heavy to carry. live and learn, i guess!",1
Primo Viaggio SIP,We have been using this car seat for 6 weeks now and I wish I hadn\'t picked it out because of its name. It\'s not very comfy for him. I always have trouble opening the canopy without it comming off the back. The straps don\'t pull out easily and I always have a hard time with my sons arms. I don\'t have trouble getting it out/in the base. It\'s very light weight.,2
Primo Viaggio SIP,"I was skeptical that this was worth the extra $$ over all other car seats. Once I unpacked it however, I was very impressed. It is extremely well made and well padded. The ease with which the buckles are adjusted and fastened is amazing. It attaches and detaches very easily from the included base, as well as the Pliko P3 stroller.",5
Primo Viaggio SIP,"We chose this model based on reviews as well as Consumer Reports. Although CR\'s carseat ratings are currently (Jan \'07) in a bit of turmoil, I still think we made a good choice.Our criteria in order: safety, convenience and styleThe baby accompanied us to restaurants and I don\'t see how this would have been possible without a take it with you-style carseat. The seat is moderately heavy as compared to other models, but I was under the impression that this was a safer seat than others I looked in to.Installation was no problem. I did take the seat to our local carseat installation center - available at many childrens\' hospitals and firehouses.We also switched the carseat from our car to grandma\'s car (she bought her own base) quite frequently with no complaints.Our daughter is not tall (nor am I) and she has finally outgrown the seat at 8.5 months. We have now purchased a Britax Marathon and this seat seems HUGE next to the Primo Viaggio.",3
Primo Viaggio SIP,My problem with this carseat is that you can\'t use it without the base!  So if I\'m using it with the stroller and want to get into a car with a friend - I cannot.  When I traveled not only did I have to check the carseat - but the base as well.The hood is useless and often pulls off the back when pulling it forward.  And evenetually creeps back again.I\'m lucky enough to have a small baby - 13 lbs and 25 inches at 6 months.  Although had I known I couldn\'t use this until he was a year or more (height restriction) I would not have purchased it.  We purchased it because I wanted the light weight Peg Aria storller - which I love - and I didn\'t want to get a non-Peg carseat - I wanted it to lock in - which it does.  I hear Graco City Line or someting has a lightweight stroller and a fashionable carseat - it came out after I purchased my Peg.,3
Primo Viaggio SIP,"I really like the weight, color, safety ratings and package of the Peg Perego infant seat and stroller, but there are a few drawbacks.  The infant seat has low height and weight maxs, the handle is a bit hard to move and the latching into the stroller takes a bit getting used to, but the biggest drawback is needing the base to use the car seat.  When the Grandparents want to take her out, or friends offer to drive, they either have to use a different car seat or we have to move the base (a pain).  My daughter loves the seat and the strollers, but in retrospect I probably should have gone with Graco - at least the car seat.",2
Primo Viaggio SIP,"We loved the safety rating.  We loved how snug it fit our daughter.  We loved how long it lasted for her (height and weight limits).  We loved the look, color, pretty much everything about this carseat but how freakin\' heavy it was!  We hauled it in and out every single time since we had bases in each car and usually one of us was dropping off and the other picked up.  That became a huge chore, especially when you add in a 20-ish pound baby!.  As much as we loved this, we would not buy it again if it weighed the same.",3
Primo Viaggio SIP,"This is a great car seat for newborns and very young infants, but if you don\'t want to turn around and spend another $200-300 as soon as your little one reaches 4-5 months, then don\'t get it.  I have last year\'s model, which is only slightly smaller with a 20 pound weight limit, but the same holds for this one because there are very few changes.  The seat is narrow, which is great for a newborn, but the height limit is 26 inches, and our not even 4 months old, 12 pound skinny and tall daughter is too tall for it, so we have to get a convertible seat to accommodate her height.  If you are a new parent, please do yourself a favor and start with a good convertible seat for infant-toddlers.  Britax makes the Boulevard that adjusts from 5 pounds to 65 pounds, and at $300 versus $229 plus $300 in four months, you\'ll save in the long run.  As much as I like this seat, it\'s safe, fits easily in the car, and snaps in and out of the base easily to transfer to the stroller, I would have rather started with the convertible from the get go and saved myself $229 to spend on diapers.  I echo another reviewer, live and learn.",2
Peg Perego Ultimate Lightweight Stroller- Black/ Toffee,"I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son.  Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.  The stroller is also extrememly ""wobbly"".  I was shocked as I figured such an ""upscale"" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little ""envelope"" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn\'t fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I\'m back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don\'t rely on the name)",1
Peg Perego Ultimate Lightweight Stroller- Black/ Toffee,"I had a Combi until a few days ago, I loved it but the basket was just too small, it was the net kind. I also wanted a snack tray for my one-yr old son.  Also I felt that my son was already growing out of it. I did alot of research, wanted a light, easy-to-handle stroller and a bit bigger than my Combi. I purchased the Aria a few days ago, after ALOT of steering in the store, with my son in it. I found no problem with the steering, as a matter of fact it was so easy to steer, even with one hand. My son has more elbow room in his new stroller, and the snack tray is great. I don\'t use the 5pt harness much, but the times that I have I had no problem with it. The basket is great, lots of room.  As far as the cup holder for the parent, it isn\'t big by any means, but I never carry around a 32 oz big gulp, so it isn\'t a problem for me. I usually have a small bottle of water or small Starbucks cup. Unless you travel with large cups or bottles, it works just fine.I am very happy with this stroller, the weight of it and carrying handle are both wonderful.",5
Peg Perego Ultimate Lightweight Stroller- Black/ Toffee,"We used this stroller four times and it broke (the connection for the car seat).  It was fixable, but my fear is I will be travelling and have the stroller break again at which point I will have a lot of unusable plastic to carry around while trying to get home.  Some of the cosmetic features have also fallen off.We have had no luck with the business where we purchased it or the manufacturer.  I have no faith in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.",1
Pliko P3 MT Stroller - toffee,"After heavily researching strollers I decided on the pliko.  This is my third child and I have had many gracos, evenflos and even peg peregos but this one is great!  I love the way it pushes and the adjustable handlebars.  I took it out for a walk last night and it steered so easy that my other kids could do it.  It has a large hood which is great for a sunny day (that is why I picked this over the aria).  It is easy to transport, lightweight and the child tray is a must have for a little one.There are a few things I don\'t like about it-the cup holder is worthless.  Especially in this day of starbucks-you could never put a hot drink in there.  Also, the basket is pretty inaccessible from the back.  You have to access it from the front.  Also, I tried the peg perego car seat and was very disappointed.  It is big, heavy and hard to get into the stroller.  I ended up getting a graco and using the universal strap and it is much easier but not as nice looking.Overall, I would highly recommend this stroller.",4
Pliko P3 MT Stroller - toffee,"We purchased an older model of this stroller because my husband hated our Graco Quattro Tour and its large size.  If you are in the market, a word to the wise - hold out if you can for when the current models are clearanced to allow for new colors next year - same features, better price!  Plusses of this stroller - it is lighter and narrower than the Graco.  Also the sunshade can be stretched all the way to the snack tray so you truly can shade your child from the sun (the Graco\'s only goes overhead). However:  While folding takes up less net space, it is longer - it must be diagonal in my Jeep trunk and is too long for trunk-to-backseat.  I used to be able to have my Graco all the way to one side and carry a lot of cargo, but now I have to bury my stroller if I need to do it.  Also as many have said, the storage basket is hard to access...what were the designers thinking?  In the next update I\'d love some accessible storage for things like change, napkins, etc. at hand-level like the Graco\'s had.  The cupholder is horrible, it won\'t hold a cell phone or keys without the danger of them slipping through.  Again not sure what they were thinking.Overall I would love to merge the features of the Graco with the lightness and maneuverability of the Peg Perego.",4
Pliko P3 MT Stroller - toffee,"I just bought this stroller for my 4th child. He is 7 weeks old and I wanted a stroller that the car seat would fit in, but still be light weight. I LOVE this stroller. I didn\'t have any problems locking the car seat into it. It just locks right in. Also, I can actually hoist the stroller up in my SUV. It doesn\'t take up near the amount of room that my other stroller did. Very manuverable. I took it into a small shop and had no problems. It also has a stand on the back for my 2 year old after the baby is sitting up. I just wish they made a double stroller like this one where you can use the car seat. You won\'t be disappointed with this stroller. I have had a TON of strollers and like this one the best.",5
Pliko P3 MT Stroller - toffee,"I have this stroller in the mint color.  We\'ve had it for alittle over a week now.  I originally wanted a maclaren but thought it would not be enough support for my 4 month old.  The P3 looked comfortable and is a nice looking stroller.  So far I like the stroller but the best judge is my baby boy.  The first time I sat him in it he hated it, I felt horrible I thought I made the wrong choice, but as the days went by he liked it more and more.  I guess the change from a car seat travel system to a spacious stroller took some getting used to.  It\'s not as light weight as I would have liked it to be but for the size of the stroller itself it closes up pretty compact.  The wheels started to squeak alittle, I used WD40 and that did the trick.  The ride is nice and smooth and the stroller is easy to manover even with one hand.  Closing it was alittle of a challenge until I got the hang of it, closing it with one hand it not easy but not impossible.  I guess there isn\'t the perfect stroller out there the important thing is that your baby is safe and comfortable.  I feel that with the P3.  When he\'s older and stronger I will get something lighter and compact.",4
Pliko P3 MT Stroller - toffee,"I have the toffee color and it is gorgeous.  The color is really a greyish silver tan with black, cream and a tiny bit of red detail. The matching car seat was very expensive ($230 - yikes) but my husband loves that it matches the stroller and it has the Side Impact Protection.  The stroller handles very well.  I love how easy it is to fold up and store in the back of my SUV.  My only complaint is that the hood doesn\'t cover enough and sometimes it does take a little while to attach the car seat.  By the way, the car seat is VERY heavy by itself and I don\'t recommend hauling it around very much without attaching it to the stroller.",5
Pliko P3 MT Stroller - toffee,"Even though we still have a few months before it will be used, I already love my Pliko P3.  After doing a lot of comparison shopping and looking at the Graco, we decided to get something that is light and easy to use is well worth it.  We also purchased the Primo Viaggio SIP infant seat, which is also well worth the money-since talking with a coworker, his son would still fit in the Peg infant seat and not in the Graco.  People have said it is hard to latch the car seat on may not have the latches in the proper position, because it is very easy after the first time.  I am hoping our little guy will like it as much as we do!",5
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"I bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story.  Luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted.  I bought it because it was lightweight, had a front tray, adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color.  I was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size Gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk.  Well, after a couple weeks, I changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my Graco for longer trips.  Here are the negatives I experienced with the Peg Prego Aria:- Poor steering.  Can not handle quick turns.- Sun shade only works for direct overhead sun.- 5 point harness is poorly designed.  The plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled.- My drink holder broke.- Overpriced for features and quality.My positives are:- Nice looking- Easy to fold- LightweightI keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company.  Thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room!  I would not buy a Peg Prego again.",2
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"The Aria is the finest lightweight stroller I have found and I have done TONS of homework.  It has every feature I need, especially the child snack tray and a good-sized storage basket.  My eight month old can sit in total comfort completely upright, she can lay all the way back, and it adjusts anywhere in between.  She\'s so happy in it.  And it is EASY to steer, even with one hand.  I don\'t know why anyone says it takes force to steer, because it just doesn\'t.  The front wheels have a ""no swivel"" lock, so make sure that\'s not on and it steers wonderfully.  I now wonder why I bought the heavy, bulky Graco travel system (comfortable for baby, but a pain for me to take anywhere).  I adore this stroller.",5
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"I can hold my 24 months old one hand and drive it the other hand. Much easier to manuver than my Graco single stroller. It\'s very sensitive to your movement and you can control it really well by just using one hand. Compare to the Graco, the only drawback is there\'s no parent\'s tray (but I found it fine and you can buy a accessory bag if you want)and the basket is not able to be lowered (if you have a medium size bag, it should be no problem). They use a very study string to make the recline mechanism. The good thing is under this mechianism, you can recline however you want. The partly removable 5 point harness is good for those who are not very active. Overall, a very high quality stroller. Not perfect but I recommend it.",5
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"I got this stroller about 1 and 1/2 years ago. After only 6 months I havd to send it back for repairs. They replaced the frame and sent it back. I am dealing with the same problems again. It is very hard to push, and you can hardly turn this stroller with out using all of your body weight to do it.This stroller will be going in the trash and I will buy another GRACO. DONT WAST YOUR MONEY IT IS NOT WORTH THE $200.",1
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very ""user-friendly.""  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn\'t meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.",2
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"Positives:- very light weight, 9 lbs.- folds flat (but not as compact as a Combi)Negatives:- need two hands to open/close (holding a baby, good luck!)- small basket - can barely fit a very small diaper bag- sun shade is a joke, not even sure why there\'s one- wheels sometimes ""stick"" not always smooth- cup holder does not stay on, threw it away after one dayThis is an umbrella stroller on steroids (and the price reflects that). The only reason to get it is the light weight. My lovely wife, is 100 lbs. so there was no way we were going to buy the mega travel stroller. Some of the name ""stick-ons"" fell off in 4 months, that\'s not too bad, but it does reflect a little about the quality. The worst part by far is the two-handed operation. Had to set the baby on the cement one day to get it open. Both of us were not very happy.",3
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"We\'ve had this stroller for over a year now, and are very happy with it.  The main thing I wanted a light weight stroller with a tray. I have an old Peg-Perego Pliko, but it didn\'t have a tray.  The tray makes all the difference.  It\'s so much easier to feed the baby while you\'re out somewhere.  It\'s easy to fold and unfold.The basket is big enough to store a diaper bag.  It\'s a great basket for this light stroller.The only thing the adult cup holder fell off after a couple of months of use. It\'s not very sturdy.",4
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"It\'s not worth it for paying for $199 for this stroller.  So save money for soemthing else!1) It\'s very hard to stire (drive/move around) the stroller only after using 3 months.  Wheels keep going to one direction and you have to constantly apply the force to redirect the stroller.  It\'s very tireing.  Everyone who ended up pushing olur stroller ""noticed!"" about it.  Something that cost you almost $200 should not have such a problem.  Easy to move around is Must HAVE quality for the stroller.FYI, I didn\'t abuse the stroller, by taking to mountain or trail walk, this start happening after the normal usage of shopping and light neighbor walk.2) The cup holder on the handel keep pupping off!  Unbeliable cheapo quality!  I couldn\'t believe it!3) Harnest is keep crambling off from the back seat area, because there is only one hock to keep the harnest. The hock is short and doesn\'t lock, so everytime, you take harnest off from kid, it easily come off the hock.  It doesn\'t stay in the position.  It was so annying to set it back everytime before you put kids back on the seat...so now, i gave up and my kids just sit on them.  I wish they designed in a way the shoulder straps come out from the back of the seat pad and stable position.BUT IFyou don\'t care about money, and above low qualities, it\'s great one to have for the reason for a light weight and big and easy to use storage after all.",2

Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"I\'d read the negative reviews, too. But in the end I was swayed by the name and the style (and probably the price - surely something so expensive MUST be good, right?) WRONG!! If you think the sunshade isn\'t such a big deal, IT IS - I spend at least a few minutes on every walk trying to rig up something w/ blankets to get the sun out of my boy\'s face and then he can\'t see anything as we walk. The 5 point harness isn\'t permanantly attached at the back; it\'s just held in with a flimsy piece of fabric and comes loose constantly (am I missing something here - what is the point of this design???) With a squirmy kid, one can easily imagine the child tipping forward. As mentioned, you can neither fold nor steer with one hand and, yes, in case the message hasn\'t been adequately driven home, the cup holders are terrible and the basket isn\'t easily accessible. So what if it\'s light. . .it doesn\'t work and it\'s garbage for the high price - shame on them. I just resold it for $65 and I feel guilty having charged that much!",1
Peg Perego Prima Pappa Diner High Chair,"but not so great after the menu becomes more elaborate.  Just too much of a pain to clean the straps,rims of the tray, and all of the crevasses in the cushion - food gets deaply set in and when you feed a messy 10 month old 4 - 6 times a day - that\'s all you do - clean up.  We are going to just get a simple wooden swedish highchair now that he is older and just consider this a lesson learned.  Granted the wheels are great - it\'s comfy, etc but the cons outway the pros for us.",3
Peg Perego Prima Pappa Diner High Chair,"We ordered this chair in April 2006 for our then 4 month old. She is now 11 months old.  We have been very happy with this chair so far.  It\'s not too bad to clean, you just have to really dig in there and the cover does come off so that helps.  We just recently saw a crack coming in under the tray and the cushion where baby\'s bottom goes has a huge tear where it split right at the seams.  Our baby is only 19.5 pounds and not super active in the chair.  We ordered from Amazon but will try to return to our Babies R Us Store.  Stay tuned.......we probably will try another chair and see how that goes.",4
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea",This cup is great!  No leaking and it keeps liquids cold for quite a while.  I had milk and one ice cube in this cup for a play date and it kept the milk cold for over 3 hours.,4
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","We have three of these currently and I am tempted to buy more (have been looking at the Foogo, we currently have one of those, but it is just as effective as those, and doesn\'t have a straw to leak).  There are some pros and cons to these cups. They do keep liquid cool (maybe not fresh from the fridge cold, but we always add ice and that helps too). They don\'t leak if they are properly sealed (you need to go past the arrow on the lid, and yes I have sometimes had issues where it took me a couple of times to get the lid open, but it\'s a rare occasion). If there is liquid that comes out, it is usually from what is left it the little hole where they sip from (or from me not tightening the lid properly). Looks like a grownup\'s coffee mug, my kids sometimes prefer these to other cups that we have. Although I do like a straw, those can be a hassle to clean, these just have the single plug that goes into two slots in the underside of the cup\'s lid. Colors are nice (we have a dark blue (my daughter calls it indigo) and green and turquoise, all can be unisex. Tapered bottoms that will fit into cup holders. And for the price you can pay for one Foogo (which will leak, trust me, we\'ve been using ours for three years, can\'t count how many times I\'ve had to clean up a whole 10oz of liquid that have spilled from cups being on their sides), you can purchase three of this one at the same price. BPA free (that\'s a plus) and will withstand any number of hard falls. These really are good little cups.",5
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea",This cup is impossible for myself and my husband to open! We were only able to use this cup once since it never opened again. I have a friend who is having the same problems with this cup.Also it is not what we were looking for it is to spill proof I was looking for a cup to transition from the playtex straw cups to a regular cup. I wish we had removed the valve before giving it to my daughter.,1
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","I use this cup for my 17 month old boy and he loves it!  He can drink as much as he wants without having milk all over his face and shirt.  The top is designed to look like a real cup.  The valve included is the same as all Playtex spill-proof cups, it doesn\'t leak at all.  The cup itself is made of thick, sturdy plastic that is double-walled so that the drink stays cool and no condensation forms on the outside of the cup.  The tumbler also is slightly contoured for little hands to get a good grip on it.  It can withstand multiple throws on the floor just fine with no cracking or breaking.  The Playtex Tumbler is available in six colors: pink, purple, blue, turquose, green, orange.  There are plain cups and those with cute prints such as flowers, fish, frogs, butterflies, dots, sports balls.  These are recommended for ages 2 and up, however, a one-year could handle this cup just fine.  My son has always hated traditional sippy cups because of the spouts.  These are absolutely perfect for him!  I definitely recommend these for anyone whose child is ready to move onto a different type of cup.",5
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea",These are easy to clean and the kids enjoy them! We have bought this brand before and they last. Just make sure to keep up with the flow valve.,5
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea",My 15 month old loves his big boy cup.  He has no problem drinking from this sippy.  We thought he might be too little but he\'s not.  Does not leak and keeps his drinks cold.  Easy to clean only 3 parts.,5
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","This is a GREAT overall cup.  Some points of interest:- This cup may keep drinks colder ""twice as long as regular cups"" as it claims but PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THAT IT WILL KEEP PERISHIBLE ITEMS COLD (OR HOT) FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME such as a Thermos type of insulated vessel.  I have a Thermos type of vessel with a flip cap that I use for keeping ice water cold throughout the day - I can leave ice water in it all day or all night and there is still ice in it 12 hours later.  In the hopes that I could send milk with my preschooler in these cups (which we have been using for three years), I did an experiment.  At 5 pm I put 4 ice cubes and cold water from the refrigerator filter in the cup.  I stirred it around with an accurate digital thermometer until the ice was almost melted and the temperature read 39.2 degrees f.  At 10:14 pm I opened the cup and again took the temperature of the water - and it was 70.7 degrees f, in a room that was air conditioned to 70 degrees.  That\'s right - ROOM TEMP IN 5 HOURS!!  Just so you know, it may be insulated but it is not serious insulation.  Like I said, we have used these cups for 3 years, and I always thought they kept drinks cooler than non-insulated cups but never really paid attention to how long they stayed cold.  Knowing that I wouldn\'t be there to check my child\'s milk and if it was kept cold, I just had to know for sure HOW well it worked and if my child could sip from it all day long.  Because of the results of this experiment, I send water in his cup instead of milk.- Do not overtighten.  When I tighten the lid so that the arrow is on the tighter end of the ""closing range"" delineated area, it is difficult to open.  I use a clean square of that non-skid flexible rubber grid that you can put under rugs so they don\'t slip when you walk on them.  It works better than any other commercial made rubber type of jar opener, at least out of the ones I have tried.  I usually tighten the lid just so the arrow is almost to/just at the looser end of the ""closing range"" delineated area.- Make the holes in the rubber stoppers bigger.  I take a razor sharp knife and make the ""minus"" sign shaped slits into ""plus"" signs.  This allows for more flow and easier drinking.  This also can allow slight leaking, just so you know, but usually only a few drops (if at all).  Just do it a little and then test it - actually drink from the cup to see how easy or difficult it is to get liquid out and adjust accordingly.  I personally test drive ALL my kids\' cups first - you would be surprised how difficult it is to get any liquid from many kids cups!- I have read other reviewers say they take the rubber stopper out when their child is at the table, etc. so they can drink more quickly.  I have found this also to be true and it works great in that capacity.- Beat the heck out of them.  These things are virtually indestructible!- There is no plastic smell that I have noticed from the six or so that we have purchased in the past 3 years.  I like that.  I also like the design and the colors, and they don\'t have dumb pictures or monkeys on them or any of the otherwise ridiculous crap that manufacturers plaster all over baby products.  They are simple, attractive and functional.",4
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","After reading the reviews on these cups I decided to invest in 14 of them for my two Autistic daughters. They were probably a lifesaver for me. It took my girls almost three years to figure out that there was not an invisible shelf that they could sit their drinks on.The first couple of months trying to transition from a bottle, with the help of a occupational therapist about fried the last of my patience. But on the therapists advice, one night I couldn\'t sleep I trolled through sip-pies reading up on reviews and decided to invest. Out of the fourteen, one leaked on the lid screw joint, and two eventually leaked through the valve stem. I made a mark on the one that leaked and kept it for meal time only, and I ordered a replacement pack for the valve, and have had no problems. I too had some problems with the lid sticking, usually swelling from change in temp. If putting it back in the fridge for an hour didn\'t loosen it, then I would resort to an oven mitt that had a rubber griper and could then get the lids open.",5
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","After going through several brands and styles in the last 4 years, these are the ones I like the best! Simple 3 pieces (unlike munchkin\'s straw cup with 5 peices, which would be a runner up, except kids can\'t open them). My pet peeves about these cups are that that are a bit top heavy. So when they aren\'t filled they tip over easy, yes a little milk from above the valve drips out...but NO PUDDLES of milk/water. I wish the inner part was clear and not gray, so I could see how much is left/and what is in it. The flowers on the purple cup wears off, love the glitter ones, aqua is unisex color (we have all the colors in the pictures listed plus orange).

"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","My son is 2 1/2 yrs and would not part with his bottle (for drinking milk). I removed the flow control thus making it free flow.  So far he is happy drinking juice and other liquids.  The other cup is still in its packaging - no headway yet with drinking milk.  To address some of the concerns raised by other parents.  The lid does collect the drip back when he\'s drinking which can lead to a wee bit of a mess, nothing major.  For him, I had to remove the flow control as he is able to drink from an open cup so he\'s comfortable without it. I previously bought the Avent 1st grown up cup (with the two lever like handles) but that was a disaster,This cup is also quite durable and the colors are definitely attractive. I tried other cups and so far I am pleased with this purchase. Note the spout is free (not tiny holes) so you would need to know what your child will be comfortable with.",4

Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out.Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well.",1
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I love this stroller!  I hunted high and low and it came down to the Aria Twin or the Maclaren Twin Techno.  Both were great but we settled on the Aria Twin because of a few things.  Ultralight weight...I am 5\'1"" and this is easy to fold and load in to my SUV.  Also, it has a great basket underneath, steers easily with one hand and each seat reclines to almost flat.  It also has a tray that does two things, keeps the kids in the stroller and it\'s easily utilized for snacks, etc.  When we tested the Maclaren my older daughter who is 3-1/2 kept on leaping out of the stroller because it did not have a tray.  Of course you can buckle them in repeatedly but it can become a pain if you are using this stroller at let\'s say the mall or Disneyland like we do.I\'ve read many reviews on this stroller and I must say that if you are looking for a ultralight weight stroller with great style and durability, this is the only choice.  We used this stroller traveling to Maui just recently and it was perfect.  We also use this stroller at Disneyland frequently (we have annual passes and go almost every weekend)and it definetely gets and A+!  We also have a Graco DuoGlider and this is a 1/4 of the weight.  We enjoyed the DuoGlider, too but that was a beast!  Something like 35 lbs. without kids and stuff in it.  Yikes!  Try pushing that around for 8 hours at Disneyland!  The Aria Twin is a stroller well worth the money, you won\'t be disappointed.",5

So thought the product quality would be the same.  Used it for 2 years with no problems.  But have to say stay clear of the aria design.  Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc.  Its not durable at all!  We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too!  We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off.  My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product.  She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno.

Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I am writing this review 18 months after I purchased this stroller. I bought it when my daughter was 15 month old and my son was a newborn. We are very active and I fly quite often by myself with the kids. I would give this stroller high marks for the fact that it folds flat and it lightweight. I give it low marks for the wheels. There is something wrong with the design in that they get turned and you will get stuck. You need a walking start to get through tight doorways and if you stop, you then have to back up and try again. Sometimes it takes me 3 tries to get through doors and I have been using this for 18 months! Overall it has been okay, but if I am paying more than $300, it should be fabulous! Get either the Graco model or the Combi model.",3
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby.  I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive.  I don\'t mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller.  It doesn\'t turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck.  There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn\'t stay upright.  There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack.  They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow.  the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep.  There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all.  For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed.  I actually use my orignal ""cheap"" single stroller, instead.",1
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"This stroller is super light weight, and it is perfect to take in and out of the \'ole minivan for those daily errands.  It is not designed to jog around the neighborhood, and it wouldn\'t last if you tried.  But it has an ample basket (only designed to hold about 7lbs), and it fits through doorways.  **Note** I have noticed a lot of people on other sites complaining about the way the 5 point harness connects to the back of the seat.  Before I purchased the stroller, I called Peg Perego, and they told me people are not using it correctly.  The tag of material on the back of the seat is only designed to hold the harness while your little ones get in and out of the seat.  It is NOT supposed to stay in that little piece of fabric while the child is in the seat.  The shoulder straps merely fit over the shoulders, it isn\'t anchored on the seat.  She assured me this type of harness has been tested, and it is very safe.Also, because my husband and I are both about 6\' tall, we love the fact that there is no middle set of wheels for us to kick as we walk.  The handle could be a couple of inches taller for my taste, but I do not have to bend over to push.I love this stroller, and my 5 month old twins and my 2 year old all love it too!",4
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I got this stroller when my daughter was 2 and my son was a newborn and I have been trying to use it for a year now.  It is VERY difficult to use. When there was a weight difference in my children it would always pull to the side of the heavier child.  The wheels do not work well at all. We recently took it to Disney World with us and used it only one day at the park and it was so hard for me to get around with it that I ended up paying $18.00 per day for the remainder of our trip to rent one of their strollers.  The positives are that it is lightweight and folds up flatly, though it is difficult to open at times.  I would not recommend this product.  The cost definately does not equal the value.",2
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I can\'t believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It\'s terrible.PROBLEMS:1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies\' eyes, and you\'ll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory.2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It\'s hard to steer in a straight line, so it\'s easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks.3. IT\'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week.4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don\'t even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing.5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn\'t be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said "" don\'t know.""Yes it\'s lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that\'s difficult to steer.My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren\'t an active parent -- I\'m not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at ""stadium seating"" strollers.",1
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I thought Peg Pegero was suppose to make strollers that were really good. So I decided to purchase the Aria. I wish I hadn\'t. It is light and folds easily. However, my wheels get stuck so it\'s hard to get going. Next, the cup holder didn\'t even clip on! Never mind being to small. The stickers fell off the stroller. I really am disappointed with the quality. Like many other moms I have the graco stroller which I didn\'t like because my kids would kick each other\'s chair.",3
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Do not buy this!!!! I hope you listen because you will be very very very sorry.  I was attracted to it because it is sleek and cooler looking that the bulky frumpy Gracos, but once it arrived I was sorry I bought it. The cupholder broke the first week and is long gone. The fold up and stand option never works.  It falls over everytime.  However, the worst and most annoying part about this thing is that the stroller has absolutely NO manuverability. The wheels constantly get stuck. The plastic is so flimpsy and they used such cheapo materials.  Peg Perego should be ashamed they are charging so much for such a junky stroller.  I am tossing it and buying a different one.",1
K\'s Kids Learning Shoe,"I bought this for my grandson\'s toybox at my house (8 months old).  He loves the bright colors, chews on the red nose, looks at himself in the mirror, and examines the features he can\'t do just yet.  I think it\'s a really cute addition to his array of toys and something he can grown into.",5
K\'s Kids Learning Shoe,"I thought this would help my granddaughter with learning about buttons, zippers,etc. However the button hole is not large enough to really fit the button and frustrate all  of us toddler and parents. I am not as happy as I could be with this toy.",2
K\'s Kids Learning Shoe,Received this as a gift about a month ago.  Keeps my 9 month old entertained.  He likes to chew on the shoe strings and look at all the other features.  I imagine he will find more to do with it as he gets more coordinated.  So far he loves it....which means I love it.,5
Pigeon Baby Infant Feeding Soft Tip Spoons Made in Japan,"We got this as a gift from my husband\'s colleagues. They shipped it all the way from Singapore and I am so glad they did it!I use the green handle spoon to feed my baby who is 6 months old. The yellow spoon holds very tiny amount. (I guess it would be perfect for some babies because mine liked to eat solids when I started giving him cereal and the yellow spoon quantity was frustrating for him). The green spoon has a flat surface where he can easily eat from the spoon instead of me swiping it against his upper gum for the food to go into his mouth. It has a softer tip than the handle and he wants to hold it and eat by himself too!The only thing is that when I fed him carrot, it stained the spoon :(I use the yellow handle spoon to mix his food but rarely use it to feed the baby.",5
Alex Toys Stickers For The Tub - Space,"I love this for my son, he is 32 months old. Soon after the package arrived my son start to play with this. He lined them up next to the wall and play with them. Later he stick them on the tile in the bathroom, learning there names. I am very satisfied.",5
Rainbow Timber Game,"I discovered this game at a creative friend\'s house.Her son, age 5, introduced me to it. Rainbow Timber is made in Germany, of solid, painted wood. Recommended age on box is 6-99. There are ""54 wood blocks in 6 colors, one multicolored wooden die"" per the box. The box comes with a cardboard stacker. Pull out the blocks, one at a time, and hope the tower doesn\'t fall. The game is interesting and suspenseful, but it is also versatile: it can also function as an add on to blocks collections or become whatever children create.  Parents will have fun playing the game and perhaps welcome the challenge. Don\'t feel bad when your kids win!",5
Rainbow Timber Game,"I am a science teacher and was lucky to receive a grant from our PTO to purchase six sets.  I\'ve used them in an Ecosystem Jenga activity to have students learn about the impact on an ecosystem when plants, animals, or other aspects of ecosystems are negatively affected (such as a species extinction).  The kids love playing the game and the blocks are a great learning tool.  The blocks are sturdy, well made, and will be used for years of teaching.  Now to develop other activities for them in the classsroom!",5
Rainbow Timber Game,"Timber is a wonderful game. It is loads of fun for everyone. You can have many players. They each take turns. You can use the blocks for lots of other fun stuff too. We have a player who is too young for the game, but he really enjoys stacking the blocks to make lots of different things. You can\'t go wrong with this game and the enjoyment last for hours and hours.",5
AWABUKUMITON Free Size 1piece infant bath glove,"Maybe it\'s because I am using a foam wash and not liquid, but this did not lather at all.  Also I have small hands and when I put it on dry it fit nicely, however as soon as I put it under water the weight of the water made it stretch and it kept slipping off.",1
K\'s Kids Musical Pull Bee Hive,"This is a great musical toy. It is soft, colorful and very much fun when the bee is going back inside the hive.",5
K\'s Kids Julia 7.5&quot; Doll,"I bought this doll for my granddaughter\'s first birthday because her name is Julia. It is very soft, washable and she loves it. I would buy this again.",5
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,"We received this as a baby gift a few years ago.  It is still in regular use.  It\'s adorable, but I hate that my kids have such a hard time turning it on.  The music and lights are activated by these tiny buttons hidden under a felt layer.  The felt moves around occasionally, so the button is hard to find.  Forget using the ignition key to turn on the music.  It took two years for us to realize that the horn actually makes noise.  Our son managed to hit the button by mistake.  It is virtually impossible to press the button through the stuffed bear on the steering wheel.  I would really like this car if I wasn\'t obligated to sit down and press the button for my kids every fifteen seconds when they want to play with it.  In my opinion, if I have to own an electronic noisy toy, it had better occupy my kids while I am in another room where I don\'t have to listen to it.It does work well as a support for a soon-to-be sitting child, but I personally prefer a boppy pillow.",2
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,"I bought it for my 8 month old grandson, thinking it would be ideal for him, to sit up and watch what was going on, but it offers no back support at all, we put him in it and he just fell backwards, so was a lot of money spent and he can.t use it",2
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,Gave this to my 6 month old grandson for Christmas & he absolutely loved it!  He can sit in it even though he cannot sit up by himself yet.  The interactive parts are easy for him to reach & the sounds are soft enough to be entertaining ... not annoying!!,5
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,"Don\'t get me wrong.  It is a nice place to set DS down, and it does keep him entertained for a while; however it wasn\'t until I read some other posts about it that I learned the \'ignition\' plays music.  I\'ve had it for over 6 montsh and all this time I thought it only honked, and even that was a challenge to get it to work!  I had to feel around in the \'ignition\' to discover there was a tiny button there.  The activation buttons are so small and unresponsive it\'s a wonder they ever worked.  I still can\'t get the music going using the \'key.\'  I\'m glad it was given to me \'cause it\'s not worth the money.  It\'s a shame because this could have been a great product!",2
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,"I didn\'t listen to all the reviews I read regarding this toy. I just had to buy it and now I am living with the remorse and disappointment. My child is bored to death and it\'s unstable. First the \'see me\' mirror is that plastic stuff that distorts so you really can\'t \'see\' anything but a blur. Second the \'key\' can be turned by a baby but it won\'t get the sounds and lights to work, as it requires nearly sub-human strength by an adult, not to mention coordination. Third if your baby likes to \'move and groove\' there\'s no back support so they can flip right out the back. It\'s cute, but a complete waste of money.",1
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,We got this for our daughter when she was about 6 months old.  It never held her interest and she didn\'t even care to sit in it.  6 months later and she still doesn\'t like it.  It\'s very floppy and the key is nearly impossible to turn without force.  My 3 year old can\'t even turn the key.  I wouldn\'t buy it again.,2
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,"This shouldn\'t even be called a toy. It is just a big waste of space ( not to mention a lot of money). There\'s nothing baby can do with it! I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to save someone from making the same mistake I made.",1
K\'s Kids Jumbo Go Go Go Toy,I ordered this car for my grandson. It is just the thing!! He loves it!! From just sitting up until they outgrow it.... Hours of fun!! Don\'t forget the batteries!!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This ladybug has helped my 2 year old daughter stay in her bed when she wakes up suddenly in the middle of the night. It is very comforting to her. There are many times I come to check on her before I go to bed and she has re-illuminated it. She sleeps with it right next to her and can turn it on whenever she wants so if she is frightened in the middle of the night instead of coming out of her room screaming she turns on her ""bug""The red and green do not illuminate as well as the blue which doesn\'t matter to us because my daughter prefers the blue everynight.Great Gift Idea for any age.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","this thing puts stars everywhere, ceiling and walls, i mean lots of stars. I haven\'t nor do i plan to look for any constellations, so i can\'t comment there. however if an astronomy lesson isn\'t what you\'re looking to give, i think you will be most pleased with this product for your little ones.i bought 5. my granddaughter and her cousins just loved them, so did their parents, better than the sandman.Update: 6/15/2012a year and a half later and believe it or not, all the turtles and ladybugs (5) are still working. all the buttons are still attached and working. the lights, all 3 colors, amber, green and blue still work. We\'ve had maybe, 2 - 3 battery changes, which i feel is very reasonable considering they fall to sleep with them on every night. They have a 45 minute sleep timer on them which helps to conserve battery life, and that\'s more than enough time for the kids to drift off to sleep with stars above.the five night lights went to five kids in 3 different homes. boys and girls currently ranging in ages 2 to 7. the boys seem to like the turtles while the girls favor the ladybug. the youngest was 7 months old at the time of purchase and he, even then, would lay staring at the stars until drifting off to sleep. and at 7, the oldest is still enjoying doing the same.Five stars...still!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This item is cute. My child likes playing with it. However, it has to be close to the ceiling to reflect the stars, otherwise just think of it as cute toy that changes color with you pressing a button and that gives some light.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We got this for our baby. While he was sleeping in our room in his bassinet when he first came home, we got used to the stars on the ceiling while both he and we drifted off to sleep.  Now we\'ll turn it on and use it to go to sleep even if he\'s not in the room.  We may have to buy another for his nursery when he moves over to his crib so we can keep this one in our room.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I see some customers got defective products, which is unfortunate. I got the Ladybug one for my daughter\'s second birthday, and she LOVES it. For her, falling asleep is difficult, and this helps her tremendously. Now that she is 2 1/5, she gets out of bed at night to turn it back on when it\'s off. It\'s easy for her to work. She even made up a story to go along with the booklet that came with it.You won\'t regret buying this, as long as you get one that works properly, like ours does. We will purchase one for our son when he is old enough, as well.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Our son had been having trouble staying in his bed at night; claiming to be afraid of the dark (although his room is quite bright). We bought this at the recommendation of a teacher and a friend. While I can\'t claim that it has banished the fears just yet, I am hopeful. My only complaint is that, despite being in original and sealed packaging, the shell arrive with several scuffs and scratches; not worth the time to package up for an exchange (and not knowing what the condition of another would be) but when ordering a new item, one would expect a few less blemishes.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This turtle makes a great gift for a little one.  Both my son (4) and daughter (6) got one (daughter has the ladybug) for Christmas last year and they love going to bed with the stars!  It has helped to alleviate the need for the hall light to be on which is great!  I have given it to my nephew this year for Christmas because I know he will love it too!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This turtle just arrived not too long ago, and after giving it a once-over I gave it a whirl.  Honestly, for the price, I believe they should have offered some more options with the item.  A soft music box feature, or an actual ""twinkle"" effect would have been nice.  The shell of the turtle is made of plastic, but its extremely light weight, so its not that bad of a deal when used around young children that like to explore new things.  The head, arms, legs and tail (Cutest part, if you ask me) of the turtle are made of very soft material, so it can pass as a child\'s cuddling toy.  When switched on, the turtle offers three colors: Blue, Amber and Green.  The blue and green work fine, but the amber color is a lot harder to see on the walls and ceiling.  Overall, all of the colors are slightly difficult to see without complete darkness.  The closer to the wall or ceiling the turtle is, the clearer the stars are.  Overall, its a night light, that\'s about it.  It serves it purpose, even though the ""brightness"" of the light isn\'t that great unless its right next to the child.  Don\'t plan on raiding the fridge in the middle of the night with this thing as a source of light.  Mr. Turtle runs on 3 ""AAA"" batteries, so I\'m not sure on how long he\'d/she\'d last with constant usage.  I recommend this item for younger children, more prone to be satisfied with a light effect toy.  I\'m not really sure if I agree with the price, but my final verdict is this:  If you\'re looking for a soft, cuddly, light weight night light, go for it.  After all, you\'ll never know how cute this thing really is until you purchase it.  Plus, shipping was fairly quick (I got him overnight, he shipped the next day).",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my almost 2 year old daughter.  We recently moved into a new house and she was having some trouble falling asleep at night.  Our new place is much quieter and darker than the old apartment.  Enter the Twilight Lady Bug!  She LOVES to fall asleep looking at the stars and will change the colors and turn it on and off.  It makes her feel secure to know she has a light she can control.  Her favorite thing to do is ""spot the moon"" on the ceiling while we are star gazing in her bed.  If the moon ends up on the wall she says ""oh no!"" and turns the bug until the moon is above her bed.  The stars look best in a dark room so this doesn\'t really work for nap time.  The three color settings each have their own brightness: blue (brightest), green (middle), red (least bright).  When shopping for night lights I was glad I came across this.  I have a feeling I will be ordering one for her baby sister soon!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is a great sleep aid for a 5 year old as it turns itself off after 30 minutes or so.  This feature, together with the low-draw LED lights result in long battery life.After three months it\'s holding up well, too.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This was a Christmas present for our Grand daughter. She uses it every night to go to sleep. Since purple is her favorite color she was especially excited.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I like the product.  It will be perfect if theres is the option to left it on during all night.  I\'m forced to the 45-minutes turn off function.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My Daughter and I LOVE this. I actually saw this before I was pregnant and loved it because I love Turtles. I always said I would buy this. I know that it\'s a bit pricey for what it is, but I justified it by making it my daughters gift for her first Christmas (she was only 1 month old).  I put her to bed with it turned on in blue light and play soft relaxing music. She honestly goes down pretty well. It casts starts across her crib and up her walls and both my mom and husband complimented on how soothing I made her night time. the only thing is that the Amber light doesn\'t seem to work well in showing the stars, but there is Blue and Green. There is actually star constellations that it casts and it comes with a little book showing which ones they are.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I\'ve given this as a gift several times, and just purchased this for my little girl.  They all love it!  I wouldn\'t mind having one for myself too!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Was completely adorable and is so cool the way it projects stars on the ceiling. It also had a little story and pictures to find in the stars. Absolutely loved it.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 2 and 3 year old girls love their night lights (lady bug and turtle).  Made well - after 6 months of regular use, both still work wonderfully.  Highly recommended product for kids.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this cute little guy for my daughter. It is to replace the ""turtle"" version of the same product that the light has burnt out in. She can\'t go to sleep with out these guys, she loves them! She is seven. They make the most beautiful stars around the room! I am going to see about a replacement bulb to bring turtle back to life.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I got this as a gift! It was a big hit! they still use them every night! Everyone who was it loved it and wanted one!!!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Soft glow of green, blue and amber. Amber is very soft, the other 2 are much brighter. Also, fun for babies to investigate. Stars are more defined if only about 3 feet from a wall, but still neat looking even if further away. Will probably use ourselves for ambiance when our son outgrows it. :)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my six year old for Christmas.  He along with my other kids who are younger really like looking at the stars as they fall asleep at night.  The stars are bright and clear - in a variety of colors you can choose between.  The body is soft and the shell hard, but it doesn\'t keep him from cuddling with it at night.  My little girl now wants one for her room.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this item few months before my daughter turned 3. We moved from a townhome where she shared a bedroom with her brother and she could look out of her bedroom into mine and my husband\'s room. In our new townhome she now has her own room and her bedroom is upstairs with me and my husband\'s bedroom on the main level. With this change she went from going to bed every night reasonable well to a making every bedtime a battle.  I tried many things and nothing worked. I saw this item at Barnes & Noble but found it cheaper at Amazon. After I bought this she thought it was so interesting and loved looking at the stars that she stayed in bed.  It is now over a year later and we have a few nights where she wants to still sleep mom and dad but for the most part she goes to bed and we haven\'t had the problems since.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I love Cloud B products and have been a faithful Cloud B customer for several years.  My oldest daughter is in love with her twilight turtle and has had it for 2 years.  I bought the twilight ladybug for my youngest daughter and it completely fell apart (stuffing coming out), the battery prongs busted during a battery change and the stars won\'t come on after only 6 weeks.  I emailed Cloud B customer service directly, including pictures of the defective ladybug and they emailed me a packing slip to return the item for a brand new one.  I disclosed in the email that I bought the item from an Amazon online retailer and that it arrived new in the box with no problems from Amazon.  Cloud B customer service has been great to work with and my daughter\'s replacement ladybug is on it\'s way.I gave this item 4 stars because of my experience with Cloud B items in the past.  I am certain the one I received was just a dud and am confident in Cloud B products as a whole.  The other products we have purchased have held up over several years.  They are a reputable company that stands behind their product.  I was contacted by customer service within 4 hours of sending my email to them.  I would not let my defective ladybug deter anyone from ordering, but wanted to mention it so anyone knew if there was a problem that the company would stand behind it.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I loved this turtle when I saw it at a book store. I found it a few dollars cheaper/free shipping on amazon.Bought one for my cousin who is expecting and myself who is also expecting. The turtle is so cute and the lights are great. The only thing- this smelled really bad...Im not sure if it was from the packaging/shipping. I did leave it out of the box to air and seems like it has gone away.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I think this is a great bedtime toy for any child. Or any adult child for that matter. Nice plush toy and the projection changes colors slowly. Really quite charming!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Our 4 year old loves this and refuses to sleep without turning this on at night. We like the product so much, that we have bought two more to gift; and they were very well received. You cant go wrong with this turtle. have it for more than 2 years now and no issues. I don\'t like the other models, they look a little silly. The green turtle is elegant and the kids love it. Very pleased with the product and its durability.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The first time we turned it on both my husband and I said, ""Wow! We should get one for our room!""  It\'s really soothing and lovely, and so cute.  We use it, in addition with a bedtime CD, to let our son know that it\'s bedtime.  Sometimes he gets the message, other times he\'s like, ""I don\'t care how many stuffed animals you turn on and project onto the ceiling, I am NOT going to bed!""  But I hope he grows to love it, \'cuz if not, I\'m bringing in into our room!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is much better than the &#34;name brand&#34; version. It\'s durable, less expensive, comes with a back story, you can switch it to &#34;off&#34; to avoid wasting the battery and has a timer to turn itself off. 3 different color lights. I put it in a different spot each night and we make a game out of finding the moon.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We love the color options.  Our 4mo old lays in her crib watching the stars til she falls asleep and even I love to looking at them. + Wish we had something like this when I was younger!  Amber is a little hard to see if its far away but otherwise this is a great buy!!! Love that as our girl gets older we can sit before bed and use the star chart provided for some extra learning and bonding time. Product says 3+ years since children could easily break it but I dont feel like its an item to be used unsupervised until much older than 3. WE love it and will use it for years to come!!  btw nice surprise to see it already had batteries installed :),5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We received this as a gift when our daughter was born.  She stayed in our room for a few months, then moved to a crib in her own room.  We used a projector-style nightlight with the planets and this turtle to put her to bed, and then the turtle would eventually turn off, which worked well.  I would absolutely love for the company to make an actual lamp like this with an electrical plug, as it\'s a wonderful night light.However, the turtle has stopped working after about 6 months\' of use.  We tried changing batteries:  rechargeable, alkaline, it didn\'t matter, it doesn\'t light up.  I haven\'t tried to contact the company as I figure it\'ll be a good toy eventually for our daughter, but it seems the mechanism can eventually fry, fyi.  For the time we used it, it was wonderful, so you can judge whether the price is worth the possibility of it not working later.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I am very pleased with the Twilight Ladybug, My 2 1/2 year old daughter just loves falling asleep with it on! I also Love that it has an automatic shut off after 45 mins!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My review is more on Cloud B than the product itself.  I know many people with the product, have had zero issues, and love it.  However in our case the Turtle we got for Christmas is defective and my son has been really disappointed.  Only the green light works and the other lights are dim, flickering on and off but still dim.  I believe the turtle has a short.  I contacted Cloud B and they gave me a canned response.  Their solution was for me to first send my Turtle back to them with me paying the shipping so they could examine it and then IF deemed defective they would send me a replacement.  I am not going to drop $10 on shipping to see if they might send me a replacement.  I followed up and said if they sent me a replacement and paid the return shipping I would then send back the defective Turtle but so far have heard nothing.Again most people I know love these products and say they are quality.  However if you have an issue and try to resolve it through the company do not expect great service or support.  If they eventually respond and make things right, I will be sure to come back here and adjust my rating and comment on what they have done.",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 2 & 4 year old boys use this twilight turtle and we love it! We can\'t actually pick out constellations but we don\'t care. It works great - there are stars PLASTERED all over the boys room - we even take it with us when we travel!! I would buy it again!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I ordered this product for my granddaughter on Saturday and received it today - totally amazed at the speedy service.  However when I opened the box I discovered that the batteries were not included and the Storybook, Adoption certificate and Star Guide were all missing.  Clearly this is a returned item!This is the first time I received a sub standard item from Amazon.  In fact I tried to make sure that it is sold by Amazon to ensure I receive good product and I am very disappointed.  I do not know what else shoud be included in the box - all I received was a turtle that would not work.",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my 2 year old niece. She absolutely fell in love with it and talks to its sweet face. It works well at night, lighting the room with the stars and moon making it a perfect night light for her. It is easy to operate so she can choose on her own the color of lights she prefers.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This little turtle is great for our one 10 week old child.  We turn the turtle on at bedtime and he just can\'t keep his eyes off all the stars around the room.  Blue stars show up best, green a close second and the amber stars are a little fainter.  I think it all depends on your paint color on your walls and the amount of ambient light in the room.  Good option to have 3 colors, one will fit your decor.  45 minute glow time is good, plenty of time to get to sleep.  Great buy, use every night.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I wanted some stars to stick on my ceiling for my little one.....But i loved this idea of portable stars. My little one stares at the stars all the time at night and it helps her fall asleep. I Love the green and Blue colors. The Amber is not very impressive color as you cant see it clearly, but otherwise great product. I have ordered one for my nephew who enjoys Astronomy. He loved it too. Overall very happy with my Turtle.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my son as a back-up night light. I had seen it at Babies-r-Us and Target, but Amazon had it much cheaper. I was hesitant at first because I was looking for a night light that plugs in and stays on all night, and this is not like that. I ended up finding a night light for really cheap, and I bought this with it because it was so cute. As soon as I got it out of the box and showed my almost 2-year-old how it works, it became his favorite thing ever. It shows stars and a moon sliver on the ceiling and walls in the dark with an option of 3 different colors - amber, purplish blue, and green. The light stays on for 45 minutes unless you turn it off. However, it is not a toy. The hard shell is kind of thin and seems easy to break if stepped on.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Bought this for my 6 month old niece, she loves it at night and also plays with it during the day. She loves watching the colors change.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Our first daughter had the turtle in this product line and loves it so we wanted similar for the second one.  Someone gave us a gift of a different product like this and it just wasn\'t as good - in our opinion.  We returned that and got this instead.  They work great, batteries seem to last long enough, and as I said our first daughter won\'t go to bed without it on.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I am giving this 3 stars because the wrong one was delivered to me. I ordered the blue one and got the green one with it\'s eyes closed which does not make me very happy. However, it works so I can\'t complain too much.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 11 yr old wanted this for xmas.  I think having the real constellation configurations makes this more special than most,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 2 year old daughter received this as a Christmas present in 2012. SHE LOVES IT and she gets so excited to pick out one of the 3 colors for bedtime. I was very impressed with how bright it was and how it literally covered her ceiling and walls with the stars.  It does not work as well if you just place it by the bed side; it works BEST if you can sit in in the middle of the room, even on the floor if you have to. I was worried when all of the sudden one of the colors wouldn\'t work and after reading teh FAQ from cloud b\'s web-site I learned it was one of the ways to tell that it\'s time to change the batteries.  No, with that being said, I did see some complaints about the turtle still not working after batteries have been changed and the solution from Cloud b is as follows, "" Try a brand with a longer ""neck"" on the positive end of the battery. The longer neck will make better contact with the battery terminals. Although Cloud b has no affiliation with any battery manufacturer we have noticed that Rayovac or Kirkland batteries usually have longer necks on the positiive terminals and work well in our products"" I NEVER heard of ""longer neck"" batteries in my life until I read this, so it kinda bothered me that this was even a ""solution"".  I think that Cloud b might need to just change the way the battery pack! I have not had any issues with the batteries thank goodness, and I hope I never do!I actually thought about buy the tranquil turtle too.  I also have the Cloud b sleep sheep and it\'s WONDERFUL as well!! This company, in my opinion, makes great products!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my 4 year old grandson, and this Christmas I bought it for a friend with a one year old grandson.  It\'s a great night light, and the older ones enjoy seeing the stars, like a constellation.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This nightlight was well made and a nice alternative to the turtle. It was really cute. the receipient thought it was great and her other children thought so as well.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I have this night light in my baby\'s room and it\'s perfect for when I have to get up in the middle of the night and feed her. The three different colors are great and I think it\'ll be perfect for our little one as she grows up.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The Turtle Night Light is a great idea, combine a night light with star projections that light up the walls and ceiling. As soon as you unpack it, you\'ll realize that there\'s not much to the toy. It is very lightweight, has no sound, only three colors (one of which is very hard to see), and a hard plastic shell that makes it less than cuddly. The constellations are not easily recognized, because the stars spread out as they project away from the unit. This means that stars might be one inch in size on a nearby wall and ten inches across on a far wall. Shortcomings aside, the nightlight does work, spreading stars around the room in every direction. But as I examined the quality and features, I couldn\'t help but think that it could have been sold for about ten dollars. That said, my daughter likes it okay, and if it helps her to get to sleep, then it was a wise investment.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of ""Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family.""",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This product does exactly what it says it does, but I found that the stars do not really show up very well on the ceiling without being placed on a higher surface, which then makes a smaller area in which the stars show up! When just placed on the dresser, the stars cover most of the ceiling in a small room, but are very dim, esp. the yellow/gold stars! The blue stars show up the best, but still so dim when placed on a normal surface! The batteries died very fast in this product also, thankfully we use rechargeable batteries! No movement of the stars or sounds from the turtle! It is also not a toy I would let my child play with, so it only has on function!",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My daughter needed a night light in her bedroom and so I bought this thinking it would be a good idea. So glad I did!!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My niece and my sister-in-law love the lady bug and the illumination at night. My sister-in-law really liked it to calm my niece during her first 12 months, and now my niece is recognizing the world around her much more and requests it at night herself.Definitely a good buy.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We just received this for our adoption shower. We have been mezmerized by the beauty of the projection and our daughter seems enchanted as well. I didn\'t know there were actual constellations but once you do, you can start to pick them out. Beyond that detail though is the sheer coverage that the turtle shell produces. Literally the entire room becomes a night sky; ceiling, side walls, everywhere. I am sure as our daughter gets older, 14 months now, it will be a nice educational tool.For now though we have blue stars, green stars, and very faint amber stars. The underside of the turtle is soft and plush, the plastic shell is very lightweight and a soft plastic. So it can easily become a favorite stuffed animal as well. We have had projector clocks before but none has produced such a fantastic projection as this. Highly recommended.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son is 10 years old and loves this nightlight.  It is not that he is afraid of the dark; he is a social person that doesn\'t like to be alone.  This helps him relax and go to sleep.  He likes that he can select the color for his mood and that it turns off when it is done.  His previous ""nightlight"" only put stars on the ceiling.  He loves that the stars are on the walls now too.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 2 month old started cooing for the first time when I turned this device on.  We now use it nightly and it helps her to sleep.  She loves ""talking"" about the stars each night.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this product for my niece who is 3 1/2.  Overall this is thing is awesome!  She loves it.  Only buy batteries to use with the product, as the included batteries are ""display batteries"" which will die pretty fast.So let me tell you a little story.  Once I gave this turtle to my niece, we turned on the lights and she immediately dragged it close to a wall.  On the wall she saw the stars in varying colors.  She really liked it.  A couple of weeks later, I get a call from my brother (the father) who tells me about what she\'s doing with the toy.  She loves it when she\'s in bed.  AND when she gets out of bed in the night to go to the bathroom, she brings it with her and looks at the stars in the bathroom!  Sometimes during the day, she brings the turtle close to the wall to see the stars too.  Moreover, it does help her sleep (or at least call mommy and daddy over a little less by distracting her with something to do).  Overall this thing rules and it makes me look like an awesome uncle!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is the second turtle that I have gotten. I got the first one for my daughter and she absolutely loved it so I figured this Christmas I would get one for my son. Even though he is just an infant I put it on the setting that rotates the colors and he looks at it until he drifts off to sleep. Would definitely recommend this to any parent and child.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for my 4 mo. old as a night light and she loves it. this product has made going to bed a much easier transition for my daughter and myself :),5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This was a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old granddaughter.  She loves it.  Not only does it give her nightlight at a time that she is scared of the dark, it has stars and the moon.  She likes someone to swing it while she chases the stars.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Lets just say the advertisement is decieving.No the stars are not bright and are rather small. I think it is an over priced nite lite.It is however cute and will help lil ones in the dark but thats about it.,3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is a great light - shines stars all over the room.  Constellations aren\'t quite right, but they\'re close.  The different color options are great.  For the price, it\'s a great deal.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is a favorite baby shower gift of mine.  The parents love it at first, but I\'ve seen many kids grow to love it within the first year and long into the future.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I got this for my child who was affraid of the dark and this product was helpful.  The turtle gives bright enough light and that soothed my child.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I sent this to my friend as a gift. And he loves it! He will give this one for his new baby.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I registered for this item and received it at my baby shower, and couldn\'t be happier.  My daughter is now almost two and still uses it every night.  Batteries last quite a while (I\'ve changed them maybe four times), it\'s durable enough that it stands up to her playing with it (she is not gentle with toys), and it travels easily.  I\'m looking for a star projector for my bedroom and after reading the reviews on others I may just buy myself another of these.  Love it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Beautiful stars all over the room, kid loves it very much! Will consider to buy another one soon for myself.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this expecting to use it as a nightlight for my child.  The light turns off automatically after 45 minutes and there is no way to set it to stay on all night.  There is also no AC adapter provided which means you go through batteries quickly.  If you are expecting a nightlight that casts stars on the ceiling and can plug in and stay on all night - this product is not it.,2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my soon to arrive grandchild.  Both my daughter-in-law and son think it is great.  After viewing the ""stars"" at their house, I want one too. What a fun item.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We bought this for our newborn. She seems to dig it.The lights are static and there\'s no music, so you don\'t have to worry about the kid getting riled up.It\'s on an automated timer, so it won\'t bother anyone in the middle of the night.It has three adjustable colors that all have relaxing hues.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is a great item. The stars look great on the walls. It\'s adorable!  a great purchase, I would recommend to any parents to get for their child\'s nursery/room.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","As everyone else, we love the Twilight turtle. We switched to different LED light every night. Unfortunately, one of the LED light went out after 2 months. I contact the customer service and they provided some trouble shooting and then repair/replacement in a timely manner. Hope the next one can last for 3000 hours.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Brought this for our 18 month old Granddaughter after we came home from visiting her in North Carolina. She had one in her crib at her house and we thought that it was so cute. Loved the way it shows the moon and stars and was so cool the way you can change their colors. We wanted her to have one here at Nana\'s and Pappys house when she comes to visit us. She really loves ""Her Lady-bug""! Thanks!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","It came in a timely fashion!  Thanks.  This is something our granddaughter has wanted for quite some time.  What fun it will be to give it to her this week end.  She is a cute little ""drama queen"" so we are thinking it will be priceless to see her expressions!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this to replace a similar turtle that I ordered from one of those discount sites.  On the turtle, after a week or so of use one of the buttons popped in so it couldn\'t be used anymore.The turtle had four colors of lights, and you could choose to have them all on, one on constantly, or automatically fade between the colors.  The constantly changing colors kept my children amused, and was really pretty to look at.  The turtle also played some pretty celtic music.This ladybug has four buttons: one on/off switch, and three colors.  That\'s IT.  You can only pick one of the colors to be on (blue, green, or red which hardly even shows up) but unless you want to sit there pushing the buttons it won\'t change between them.  No music, no other features.  For the price, that really surprised me.This ladybug is built well, it doesn\'t seem like I\'ll have to worry about the buttons poking in like the turtle, but I am very disappointed by the lack of features, and so are my kids (twins, age 14 months).  I recommend trying to find a similar product that does more, as children get bored with this one quickly.",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",i have purchased the twilight turtles many time for baby gifts and think they are great gifts and i would recommend them to any one.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This was a Christmas gift for our 2 1/2 year old daughter, and she absolutely loves it!  We have been using the Homedics SoundSpa since she was an infant, but we had been wanting to transition her to something that doesn\'t play music.  I was having images of her listening to that thing for bed until she was a teenager! The yellow setting is quite dim, but she always wants to use the purple/blue setting, so that has not been an issue.  We have it sitting on her dresser, and it works just great to illuminate the stars across the room. It is ideal to have it in the middle of the room to see all the stars clearly, but for our purposes it works where it is placed. My daughter also likes the fact that she can easily turn it on herself and even change the colors. I highly recommend this!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This little turtle has been an outstanding device that catches my little boy\'s attention. He was 8 weeks old when we got this and he loved to look at the stars on the ceiling. He still does to this day four weeks later!I would highly recommend this item to anyone with babies or toddlers.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",this turtle is awesome. makes going to bed fun for 4 yr old. she spent half an hr in bathroom playing with it when she first got it.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is a great reliable toy. My son uses it every night and it is wonderful that it has a timer. I love the timer feature so I don\'t have to try to sneak in later to turn it off to conserve batteries. It is a must buy!!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Purchased this for my great niece & nephew (9 month old twins.)  It fascinated them with all the stars and moons on the ceiling and walls.  Fascinated all the adults too.  Only thing I would change is the red did not show up nearly as well as the other colors.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for my neice for her 2nd Birthday. Now she refuses to go to bed without the sky (ceiling) lit up by the bug.A great gift to add to any kids room.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",It is battery opperated and last quite a while.  Still using same batteries after 3 months of use.  It automatically shuts off after around 30 minutes so it will not wear out the batteries that fast.  The kids like this when going to bed and the stars are really clear and are in the formations of the constellations.  I think it is soothing to them because they were getting affraid of the dark and now they can\'t wait to turn the turtle on.  I would recomend this to anyone with any age of children.  I think it was definetly worth getting.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Great product!  My son loves his turtle, and turns it on almost every night.  The colors are great.  The blue and green stand out the most.  I would suggest this to any parent.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 2 year old granddaughter really likes this.  Her mom turns it on for her at bedtime.  The stars show up very well on the dark ceiling.  I like that the color can stay the same, or it can rotate through the colors.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This was a nice gift to buy my son for christmas, however I purchased this product 1 month before Christmas not aware of the exploded battery that was in the turtle. Fortunatley the turtle still works and the exploded battery didn\'t ruin the electronic components. I would recommend to make sure this doesn\'t happen to you when purchasing this item. Otherwise I like the turtle itself it\'s a very nice night light!",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This was a great price for this item, I just wish they offered more colors. Very well made. Packaged very well..",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My husband and I bought this for our 2 month old who has been having problems going to sleep at night and seems to hate the dark. After sleeping with a light or tv on we wanted to get some type of night light. I was weary of this since it doesn\'t play music and it looked kind of generic to me. However this is the best thing we\'ve bought our son yet. The first time turning it on, his eyes lit up and he got really excited. We use it every night now and turn it back on during our middle of the night feedings. He immediately looks up in awe and starts to get sleepy again. I\'ve put this on a shelf, on the floor, and even in his bassinet when he wasn\'t in it and it\'s always worked perfectly. For the amber glow to work you need a very dark room, but hey that\'s what the middle of the night is. The amber glow also seems to be the most calming and puts him to sleep quickly. Worth every penny! Highly recommend for infants who are fussy about going to sleep at night.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","You are going to love and hate this little bugger...Look at his face! And never mind the spectacular star show he throws on my daughters ceiling each night. She loves, it. I love it. But my wallet hates him. He eats batteries. A lot of them.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","this toy was a cute idea. my baby loves the color of the turtle when it lights up, but he isnt very interested in the stars that are projected. the stars dont move, it is just a light bulb under a plastic shell with star shaped holes in it. i thought the idea of having real constellations was cute but you cant see them! in a small room the stars are spread out on the ceiling and the walls making it impossible to identify. in a big room the stars are so faint, it again, is impossible to identify. i would recommend this, b/c the calming color lighting the room is a great night light and does help my baby to go to sleep.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son loved this. It really calms him down at night before he goes to sleep. We lie in the dark looking at the stars together. Really good for common focus before sleep time. Recommend this to all.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I had this gift sent to my brother and sisterinlaw for their new baby. They said they loved it! They also have an 8-year-old son, and he loved it too. Sadly, their new baby died. But this was the only gift they were still able to use and not pack away!",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Loved the music, stars n moon! Very soothing and entertaining for my little one at bedtime . He adores it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This was the best.  My grand daughter just loves it.  It has become her new prized possession and she takes it with her everywhere.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My kids loved to look at the constellations on their ceiling.  The colors were blue or green.  It helped them to get to sleep.  It does not work at all after a few months.  The lights do not burn brightly enough to shine on the ceiling.,2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This little turtle night light has really made going to bed a lot easier for my 2-year old. He loves the stars and finding the moon. The different color options is a nice touch. I just wish it was a little brighter.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 3 year old had been begging for a Dream Lite. After seeing lots of negative reviews for the ship time, etc for that product, I decided to go with this one. My son did not know any difference and has been carrying it around for weeks now. He uses it every time he sleeps. Works great, other than the amber color being dim, but blue and green are perfect.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This turtle is amazing for little ones. My son has had one for over a year now, and this year it was purchased for my nephew. Both at were purchased at age 3 for them. They love them, my son (now 4) turns it on as soon as he gets into bed at night.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for a Christmas gift for my grandson and also bought the Ladybug for my granddaughter. These are fantastic! I want one for me ;-)P.S. The kids loved them too!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is absolutely the best night light I\'ve bought so far. We only have blinds covering the windows, so there\'s always quite a bit of outdoor light shining in, but this little lady bug really works! It projects perfectly shaped stars onto the walls and every night my little one positions it so that the moon is right above her head. It\'s her little nighttime routine to &#34;find the moon&#34;. Ladybug is right next to her pillow and even though the light shining through the little holes is quite strong, it\'s not bothersome. The plush is very soft and the quality is very sturyd. The colors (red, blue, green) are very nice and soft, which makes the whole atmosphere so magical. We now have a little game every night where we try to &#34;catch&#34; the stars while singing &#34;Twinkle Twinkle&#34;... Absolutely love it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My daughter\'s old Twilight Turtle stopped working after five years, and she nagged until we bought another.  The stars are a little bigger, and it is easier to see the constellations.  She has spent lots of time reading the small book that came with it, and that has sparked an interest in constellations and stars.  I love that turtle fades off by itself, and there is an on/off switch on the bottom to prevent accidental turning on at other times.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 3 yr old grandson spent the first night camping under the stars (in his bedroom:). He loves his turtle! A best buy!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My daugther loves to look at these stars on her ceiling. After about a month of use, the turtle lights seemed to become even brighter. The blue and green stars are perfectly shaped and clear even when the turtle is set on the floor. The amber lights can still be seen, but are more subtle. When my daughter wants to play with the turtle, she actually prefers the amber lights because it\'s easier to look at directly. This is a great product for any young child.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I spent FOREVER trying to open the battery holder! It has a screw on the outside and then a washer on the inside keeping it closed. I understand wanting to childproof the toy, but the way they did it was kind of excessive. Also, nowhere in the instructions does it state there is a washer, so I was just spinning my screwdriver like a moron instead of trying to pry the thing open.Once that obstacle was overcome, the turtle is great! The green and blue stars are much brighter and visible then the amber, but I already knew that from other reviews.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",The turtle has a hard shell and is very sturdy. The head and arms are very soft. The instructions were easy to read and follow. I appreciate that it came with a relaxing CD to listen to at bedtime. My son likes to be able to turn it on himself and change the color. I like that it stays on for 45min and turns itself off.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought the purple turtle for my 4 year old daughter when she showed a lot of interest in the commercial for ""dream lights"".  I thought these looked similar, but cuter, and the price is comparable.  I selected standard (3 business days) shipping but it showed up the next day.  It is much prettier than the pictures online.  There are 3 settings for 3 different colored lights.  The yellow doesn\'t show up on the walls very well.  I read another review that says they show up well on dark colored walls but the green and blue are good on lighter colors.  My 4 year old and her 18 month old sister keep running off to the bathroom (the only really dark room in the house during the day) with the turtle.  I have yet to see how long the batteries last and how much abuse it can take.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",my 3 year old must have this turtle on each night before going to bed.  the soft light makes him feel safe and comfortable and not be bothered so much by &#34;ghosts and monsters&#34;.  i like the auto shut off feature after 45minutes.  the different light colors are nice too.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","What a fun night light for kids of all ages.  Casts nice starts and the moon on the ceiling and auto turns off during the night.  The buttons are big so an older child could turn back on easily if he/she woke in the night.  My 20 month old loves it, we lie on the floor and give it lots of ""WOWs"".  Plus its battery powered so when you travel you don\'t have to worry about where it can be plugged in.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I have bought 3 of these now 2 as gifts for babies and one for my 3 yr old step daughter. I love them they are cute and educational also works as a good night light that turns off! The turtles are my favorite!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We had an older version of this same concept that just wore out.  Our daughter LOVES her new ladybug!  The colors are bright and vibrant and we love that it fills the whole room.  We didn\'t realize just how inferior our old version was until we got the new one.  Two thumbs up!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We have had several blackouts this winter, and our kids Twilight Turtles have saved us from tears and fears every time! The light from them was bright enough to light our way upstairs to their bedrooms, brush their teeth, change diapers, and with the green stars, even bright enough for a bedtime story :) We started with one but loved it so much we got one for each of our kids ages newborn to 5. Love it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","If you are looking for something that has three buttons and simply projects light through the cut outs of stars on its back in three different colors, that is what this is.  Maybe other people expected this, so they weren\'t disappointed, but I had expected more based upon the description and all of the positive feedback.I felt that although this is definitely cute if you are just looking for a neat nightlight for your kids, it is pretty cheaply made and isn\'t as exciting as described.  I was also under the impression that it made sounds and told a story, but there is simply a little booklet included with the ladybug.  It isn\'t necessarily the manufacturers fault that I misunderstood the description, but I thought I would clarify this for others.Summary:This has a cheap plastic ""ladybug"" shell and three buttons that project light through the cutout starts on the ladybugs\' back.  Don\'t expect any more than this.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son both love this turtle.  The blue and green stars show up best on the ceiling but to address some of the comments made about the amber stars not showing up, I disagree.  They aren\'t as vibrant as the blue and green. They aren\'t quite as defined as the blue and green either, but my kids actually like the amber colored stars to fall asleep to. The other colors are very bright and more for enjoying before bed rather than actually trying to fall asleep to.  My kids keep the turtles at the end of their beds (which aren\'t particularly high beds either) and the stars show up great at that height. I have regular height ceilings, nothing vaulted.  Their bedroom walls are light green and a light beige with white ceilings and the stars are defined and perfect.  I like this product so much I\'m going to get one for both of my toddler nephews.  It would be cool if it had a setting where the stars can move in a slow circlular pattern or twinkle or change colors randomly rather than the manual change of color buttons, but I still love it just the way it is.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 2 year old loves this light up ladybug.  We used it as an addition to her ""big girl"" room and she thinks it\'s great.  My husband wonders why we don\'t have one in our room too!  The red light really doesn\'t project stars on the ceiling, but is good as a night light.  The blue and green stars show up really well in her room.  I think this was a great purchase and well worth the money!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Bought my son who is now 4 the turtle two years ago at Christmas. It has been a Godsend. Only requires regular batteries which actually last quite a long time. Very easy to use and maintain. Soft for cuddling and yet durable. Has nice star display and he likes that he can choose the color. Feature I enjoy is the auto shut off after about a half hour...this typically allows ample time for him to fall asleep with it and yet not waste unnessary battery life. It is also just bright enough to light up his room and comfort him.  Would buy this again 100 times over.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Good nightlight.  The brightness is good (not too bright).  I haven\'t tested out the timer feature yet.  The stars can be difficult to see clear when the turtle is on the floor, and they may not cover most of the ceiling from on top of a dresser.  It doesn\'t seem to affect my kids being able to go to sleep (except sometimes they fight over who can play with it).  It has a pretty cool story and star chart included",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We got this as a gift and my daughter didn\'t care about it much when she was younger, but now at 1 she enjoys turning it on in her room when she\'s alone, lights on or off.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I have been trying for months to figure out something to help my Meth-exposed 7 year old adopted son relax and fall asleep after his ADHD medication has worn off, and he is rewired and unable to calm down his brain.  I found it!The stars on the ceiling have been just the thing to keep him relaxed and still in his bed as he waits for sleep.  We have used it as an educational tool by teaching him the constellations and then looking at the real ones in our huge rural ND skies.  But he has also just used the stars to count over and over, stare at for no particular reason, check out the different sizes, and notice how they brighten as the night gets darker, or we close his door and curtains.Meth-exposure is a huge unknown.  It is hard.  It can be trying.  It can be frustrating and hard to understand.  But when you find a product that helps, it deserves 5 stars.  Definitely buy this for your sweet little babies at home, but also consider it for therapy.  We were very happy to find it.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My two under-five grandchildren have gone nut-so over the Twilight Turtle, fighting over who\'s gonna have it in their bedroom at night. It has been most beneficial for my four year old grandaughter who doesn\'t like to go to sleep in the dark.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought two of these for my boys for Christmas.  They love their turtles and so do I.  They sleep with them every night.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Very cute and came with batteries a very nice touch as I had forgotten to look ahead of time. My son who is 6 is extreamly happy with his turtle and the beautiful moons and stars that now shine all through his room. Highly recommended!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I now own 2 of these ladybugs after the 1st one helped so much settling my 2 year old down for bedtime. I have 2 ladybugs, one for my two year old, and one for my 1 year old.  These are durable because my girls walk around with them all day often dropping them on our hardwood floors.  You don\'t have to worry about them getting to the batteries because they cant be taken out without a screwdriver, & I dont let them stand on them as I can see that breaking the plastic shell, but they have be launched across the room hitting the hardwood floors & been fine.  It honestly helps relax me too when they are not wanting to go with the bedtime program, as well as helping sooth my girls back down when they wake up scared.  Honestly why would you want a product with a bunch of bells, whistles & swirling stars when you are trying to get the little ones to relax & go to bed?  You are not trying to stimulate them.Both of my bugs have green, blue, and red lights.  The red is pretty much useless, but both other colors work well.  I set the bug on a dresser about 54 inches tall that is up against a wall, it shoots at least 50, 4 inch wide clear stars on the ceiling, a half moon, a spray of smaller stars on her curtains, and at least 10 more random stars on the walls (our rooms are about 10x12).  This bug will shut off after 45 minutes of use so it is not a true nightlight, but a small little LED nightlight across the room does the trick for us in that dept.My two year old was a demon before at bedtime, now she gets super excited to go see the moon & stars, she even tells me when we are out at night ""oh mama stars are out, it\'s night night time!""  My girl happily trots to her room now to go see her ladybug.  This is a really simple product that I wish I would have gotten a really long time ago.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This item is a lifesaver! My daughter used to put up a fight about going to sleep..this ladybug has made her less afraid to stay in her room alone. The stars on the ceiling are so cool!.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for a friend of mine who loves it.  It is a great product and highly recommend it!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My daughter needs to have this thing on at night! lol its totally cute! and she loves it! :) makes a nice gift too!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has an infant or a toddler.  They are so cute and help my granddaughters fall asleep.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is a really good night light.  The only thing is that I wish it had a cord or that the automatic timer can be shut off.  It automatically shuts off after 45 minutes.  When my daughter wakes up in the middle of the night it\'s pitch black and she\'s afraid.  Other than that, it\'s a nice product.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",He zones out on the stars while mamma gets him ready for bed and he seems to just love it!  Would buy again :),5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This turtle is so cute and perfect for a baby\'s nursery...or your own room! I love that you can have it rotate through the three colors, it\'s so soothing a pretty.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The timeline went something like this...We bought one of these for my sisters first born.  He absolutely cherished it and loved going to bed because of it.  He even wanted to turn it on during the day just to look at the stars. It stopped working after about three months.  Tried replacing the batteries.  Checked internals..  Heck, I even cracked it open and checked out the board for bad soldering..  It just didn\'t work any more... We wrote it off as a dud and a tough luck blow tour nephew...Flash forward to our first born.  We buy one.  He loves it.  Exact. Same. Thing.  After a few months it just stops working.  Lasted a bit longer for us...  Maybe 7 months or so...So disappointing for such a great conceptual product to be such a dud...",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My daughter received this as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised. My daughter is 9 months old and is facinated by the stars on the ceiling. My 3 and 5 year old nieces also love it.  I usually place it on our spare bed or on our bed. It also works great if my daughter wakes up at night. I\'ll turn it on and the subtle light is great and will automatically go off after 45 minutes.  It is soft and light weight. She likes to play with it during the day, too!  I would\'t say it is a necessity, but it is cute for a child who has everything.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This was just what I wanted as a \'nightlight\' for the nursery. My son isn\'t yet using it as he\'s still in my room but my visiting nephews loved it so much I had to pick up the turtle for them. Great price plus it comes with the batteries.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This turtle has helped with night time fears of the dark! The original turtle is the one we purchased and all of the stars show up great! The timer is very useful (it goes off automatically in 45 minutes).,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","After 2 1/2 years of our kiddo sleeping with a low-light lamp on, this finally soothed our 5 year old\'s fears of the dark. We\'ve tried multiple types of night lights before this, and they were never enough. The fun stars in multiple colors combined with the fact that it\'s soft and cuddly so she can sleep next to it, is the perfect combo to help her fall asleep without all the nightly freak-outs. She\'s sleeping better now and she chooses a different color of stars to fit her mood. We love the Lady Bug night light!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is a great product! It is bigger than it looks and really does take up the whole ceiling. It provides a good amount of light (enough for you to see while walking through the room, but not enough to keep your little one up). Really a beautiful product worth all the rave reviews!!!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is a super product! I loved it and so does my 6 mo old great grand daughter! It was a good value for her birthday gift, arrived quickly, worked fine, and she and his parents love it as much as I do. I especially like that it shows the star groupings, an opportunity for arousing interest when he is older.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Bought this turtle night lite to replace one that was broken. The star constellation it casts on the ceiling is beautiful and my 4 year old daughter loves it. The light shuts down automatically after 30 minutes or so.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We got each of our toddlers one of these for Christmas. One turtle and one ladybug.  One of the colors on the turtle went out the 2nd night and we returned it and got a replacement.  It\'s been working ok so far.  But then last night, 2 of the colors on the ladybug stopped working.  We haven\'t even had it 60 days!!  I wrote the company and they said the LED lights should last up to 3,000 hours...but they don\'t and you can\'t replace them.  I can understand one bad egg but two?  I\'m sad because my kids love those and they are so cute...but they\'re turning out to be a total waste of money...",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The stars project on the ceiling much larger than I expected. It would also be wonderful if it played some type of soothing music, waves, etc.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 2 year old son was going through a stage where he needed someone to help him close his eyes.  The truth is that he had a hard time slowing down at night for bed time.  I bought him this turtle and it gave him something to do while winding down in bed and it is now a daily bedtime buddy who helps him close his eyes!Highly recommend and it\'s adorable!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Bought this after my 18 month old saw it at a friend\'s house. He enjoys seeing the starts on the ceiling and seems comforted by this.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This ladybug is very cute. The constellations it illuminates really helps to soothe a child to sleep and keeps them calm even if they wake up later in the night.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Well i got the real deal :) the clouds one and we all love it. My daughter loves everything about stars and moon so it was the perfect gift for her. She just loves it... i agree about the orange light being too faded but the other 2 works perfectly fine. Long life batteries too!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","my daughter begged and begged for this. at first i kept saying no because $32 plus tax is pretty expensive in my opinion. but i finally caved and let her buy it. she was able to test it out at the store and had a hard time choosing between the bluish/green one and the greenish/brown one. she finally decided on the greenish/brown because it had more stars on it. the newer blue/green one had less stars due to the fact that it had endangered animal buttons on it that light up (but doesn\'t show on ceiling). one thing super cool about the blue/green one is that it lets you light up both green and blue stars at the same time. while the green/brown one lets you do amber, green and blue...BUT separately. still super cool tho and daughter didn\'t regret her decision. her and her brothers absolutely loves it and is just so awed by it. turns off in 45 minutes. you can turn it off and on whenever you\'d like unlike the older model that some reviewers owned. only thing missing is some soothing noises/music to come w/ it.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My daughter has outgrown her crib and therefore also her crib light up toys.  She was used to having something soothing to distract her.  We got the turtle and she loves it.  We make choosing which of the three colors she wants as part of our bedtime routine.  I really like that the light lasts for 45 minutes, not just 5 minutes like many other night time toys/lights.  The only thing that would make it completely perfect is if it also made night sounds.  We ended up getting a separate sound machine also.  Would highly recommend",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son loves his new turtle. I wish it was darker at bedtime for him to enjoy it but I\'m sure he will in the fall/winter. I also think there should be music. The turtle is a perfect night light. The turtle is soft and has a flap over the bottom to cover the battery cover. Fantastic idea!,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I thought this might have some other features like sleep sounds. But it\'s just three different colors that project on the ceiling. I did like the fact that it came with batteries though. :),4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We got this for my daughter\'s 2nd Christmas and every fall/winter (when it\'s dark enough to use it), it\'s her ritual to turn it on and go to sleep with the stars.  She\'s 4.5 now and I can\'t imagine bedtime without the Twilight Turtle!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",3 colorful led lights covered by a plastic with simple star shaped holes (not constellations!) on top of a plush toy. If you\'re a bit creative you can make your own.You have to place it relatively high in order for it to reflect on the ceiling (on a table and not the floor)Our newborn was not engaged even when we reflected the stars on his bassinet sides.,2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Before we bought this, my 3 year old was scared of the dark and getting up at 3am every night to turn on her bedroom light. This nightlight/toy saved my sanity! It\'s bright enough to give my daughter a good sense of security, but not so bright that it keeps her awake. It has several color modes to choose from, it\'s cute and it makes stars all over the ceiling. It really adds a sense of comfort and wonder to an otherwise dark scary room. What more could you ask for?! The light stays on for a decent amount of time before automatically shutting off, so your child won\'t have to turn it on every ten minutes while trying to fall asleep. Better than any standard nightlight, since this one goes in the bed with them. My favorite part - is that it doesn\'t play music! Some of the other bedtime soothers play music so loud no one else in the house can sleep! It can\'t be taken apart without a screwdriver so I don\'t have to worry about batteries popping out. LOVE IT! Highly recommend it for any child who\'s afraid of the dark!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I clicked five stars - ""I love it"" - but really, ""WE love it."" Since she received this as a present from her gran during her second month of life, my baby has adored staring at the stars and moon projected onto our ceiling before bedtime. She is very attracted to light anyway, and this seems to soothe and calm her at the end of the day. She\'s also fascinated by my husband waving his fingers over the turtle\'s body to create ""clouds"" passing over the stars. Because she loves it so much, my husband and I are pretty fond of it, too.The turtle itself is kinda cute but my mom was hesitant about giving us the ""military"" colored one. I think it\'s a nice neutral and prefer it to the turquoise.The batteries are behind screws, which makes them more difficult to change but keeps them away from little prying fingers.One set of batteries, the set that came with it, lasted us about three months with almost-daily use. Battery life can be extended by using the on/off switch on the back between uses (we did not).I will keep this in mind for future baby presents - it would be a nice change from the typical onesie.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",What an amazing creation!  My granddaughter fell in love with this.  And this actually has some of the constellations that glow upon her ceiling.  Nice job!  Very well done...,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I got this for my two month old son because he loves looking at lights. I should\'ve read the description more closely, because I thought the stars would move around or at least flicker. The stars are stationary. I have to use it on the green light because the amber light doesn\'t show up on his light blue walls at all. The stars and moon show up decent enough with the blue or green light. Its very cute though, hopefully he\'ll enjoy it more when he\'s older.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Love the product. my 2 year old son who is in a bed kept unplugging night lights and he was afraid of the dark. The first night we used it he finally got a full night\'s sleep! Product shipped quick!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","All of the reviews I read say that this is a great product. We received ours yesterday. I bought it to help sooth our 8 month old when we put her to bed to get her to fall asleep faster on her own. She has white walls and the colors didn\'t show up well at all, even when I placed it on her night stand. The stars were too dim for her to take any interest in it. I turned on the red light, it only lights up the shell (which is more than the other colors do) and put it in the crib with her. She watched the glowing ladybug for a few minutes. My husband moved it to our room and placed it on the dresser. We could see it a little better but some of the stars just looked like wedges. It would be a great product if the lights were brighter, had music and turned.",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I ordered this product for my grandchild, it was delivered as promised, however, there were no operating instructions in the box.  It worked fine for 2 months and then it just wouldn\'t come on or do anything, changed the batteries, and still nothing.  It would be nice if there was an ac adapter with it, but there was not one.  The item was returned over a month ago and still no word on refund or replacement!  I cannot recommend this item!",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","my daughter is just 8 month old, but she stares at it when i turn it on before bed time. I think she is not fully aware or interested in it right now. But it is lovely. I pretty sure she will too when the time comes.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought the twilight turtle and sea turtle for my 4 year old son and the ladybug for my 3 year old daughter and they totally LOVE it!! I\'m extremely happy with this purchase for it is totally worth every penny!! My son was afraid of the dark and the twilight turtle has totally helped him overcome his fear!  We showed everyone the wonderful light display at our Christmas party when it had gotton dark and EVERYONE, especially the adults all wanted one!! Great gift for ALL AGES, even adults!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this to help my 2yr old on sleep on his own. It worked! He is no longer afraid of the dark. It is really cool and there are a few different colors to light up the ceiling with. It\'s a nice nite-light which even turns itself off after an hour or so.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 4 year old niece absolutely loves her turtle night light...and the best part, even after a year it still sits right on her bed!  She uses it every night and loves counting the stars on the ceiling to sleep.  Great battery life, super easy to use and has 3 different color settings.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Since the baby is sleeping in our room we set it up and fall asleep to a constellation of stars. It has three seperate color settings, red, blue and green. We usually leave on blue and most nights I am fast asleep before the timer turns off the light. It\'s battery opperated and would you believe they batteries come with? I know unheard of it today\'s world but true. We were so impress we bought two more for our nieces. they are going to love them..",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought the first one for my older granddaughter for her second birthday and decided her younger sister would like one too. She will get it for Christmas and I\'m sure she will like it as much as her sister likes hers. I got the tan and green one since it looks more like a real turtle. Do look at the shipping rates for the different companies. some are more expensive than others.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This little turtle was a holiday present for 2 of my grandaughters, ages 7 and 8. They both absolutely adore it! One of their mothers actually wants one for herself! So, come her birthday, another little turtle will find itself another home! Great gift for all ages!Because of this little turtle i am one cool grandma :)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We love that this has 3 different colors to choose from. I didn\'t realize it had a timeout auto turn off feature which is both good and bad. Good because it saves the batteries and bad because when the little one wakes up in the middle of the night she likes to have a little light to see. After about 2 years of steady use, the amber color light stopped working, and then another year later it suddenly worked again. Not sure why.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","ProsThe quality of the item is outstanding.It is cute and fun.ConsExpected a better constellation book for the price paid.It stays on for about 45 minutes.  When it shuts off my son (3) comes running out of his room crying.  If he wakes in the middle of the night he screams in terror because it is no longer on.I think it is a great concept, but do not start this dependent cycle for your child.  I wish it stayed on until I could shut it off in the morning.  Save some money and purchase a night light.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The babies we know really like seeing stars on their bedroom ceilings. Babies and starry night constellations go together like puppies and naps. You just can\'t go wrong giving this as a gift, to help create a tranquil and happy, happy, happy baby! :)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I gave this as a Christmas gift for my great grand daughter.she loved it. it was a big hit. Thanks,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Got this as a gift for a 5year old boy and absolutely loved it.  My daughter has Brite Lites and in comparison I liked that this one had more brighter lights on the ceiling than the Brite Lites and that it\'s less fabric to spot clean. (less fabric to get dirty).,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son really loves the Twilight Turtle.  We just bought it and he is 21 months old...wish I had seen this earlier on. He loves looking up to see all the stars...he walks around the house during the day looking up for them. Sometimes he\'ll just sit with the turtle & change the lights to see the different colors on the ceiling. We definately recommend this item.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My grandson has the turtle nightlight and loves it. I bought the Lady bug nightlight for my granddaughter and it\'s the cutest and best nightlight there is.  It has different setting so turn off automatically after 45 minutes or stay on all night...very convenient.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!  This is THE best children\'s night light ever.  The three different color settings are wonderful; not only does your child get to choose which color they want each night (which makes it fun for them), but the colors are soothing (the amber is very conducive for sleep), and the effect of the stars on the ceiling and walls creates a sense of awe (I wanted to have one in my room, too!).  The automatic shut-off after 45 minutes is awesome; the perfect amount of time for your child to peacefully fall asleep while the light is still on.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Wonderful, I like that it turns itself off after about 20 minutes.  Grandson loves it.  He\'s 6 and doesn\'t like complete dark when he goes to sleep.  It is perfect!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This product is excellent - all three kids ages 10 - 7 - 8 all love it and use it every night!!!  The quality is great, and the lighting effect is wonderful!  Couldn\'t be more pleased!  Thanks!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 13 mo. old seems to really like this turtle.  Only complaint is that the lighting is not bright enough.  Needs to be on a surface close to walls to view the stars.  Could be improved.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son is 4 and he has used this since he was a baby.  He loves it!  It\'s a wonderful soothing light toy good for all ages.  It actually has real constellations that you can find!  Super gift!  We bought this one for a shower gift!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",The Twilight Turtle with its soothing star and moon shapes on the ceiling is a great bedtime lamp for both my granddaughters (2 and 5 yrs-old). It has lived up to my expectations and has made bedtime a lot calmer.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This turtle is a cute concept, however, the buttons to turn it on are poorly designed.  I purchased two...had to send one back because the button had fallen inside the turtle...After a week use, the other turtle\'s button fell inside also.Very disappointing",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My twin boys, now 6, have had 2 of these since they were 2.  They have loved these since then.  Still to this day, they turn them on at night.  I can only name a handful of toys that have stood the test of time in both durability and desire.  Great item.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I just bought this for my 2 1/2 yr old who is afraid of the dark and he LOVES it! He shares a room with his 4 and 5 yr old sister and brother and they think its the neatest thing.  My 11 yr old asked why we didnt buy him one.Since having it in my 2 1/2 yr olds room, he falls asleep with no problems, doesnt get out of bed or cry because hes scared of the dark.  We had a regular nite light in his room but he still was just afraid to fall asleep.The display of stars is so awesome, hard to describe unless you see it for yourself.  My husband and I layed in our kids\' room for a long time, just staring at the ceiling and walls.I would 100% recommend buying this - its worth every penny!!!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my daughter\'s first birthday...although too young to fully appreciate it, she loves looking up at the ceiling at night and seeing all the pretty stars....it\'s become part of her going to sleep routine to look at the stars as I change the colors...she really loves this and I\'m sure will be more into identifying the constellations once she is old enough to talk and figure this stuff out...for now, I can barely identify the constellations...but who cares, this is a really neat toy!  Get one...",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Absolutely loved it! It came exactly as advertised. I\'m actually hoping these Twilight Turtles are going to be available for awhile as they make perfect gifts for loved ones.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I have bought this for my daughter (4 yrs), and she loves it so much.I still could remeber the happiness on her face when my daughter looked the stars projected at the ceilings and walls at the first time.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my just turned 3 year old boy last year for Christmas, and he still today LOVES IT!  I just decided to write a review as I was going to order them for Christmas gifts this year for other family/friends.  We use it every night - the original set of batteries didn\'t last more than a month or 2, but have only had to change them 2 times in almost a year since then.  Although I don\'t see where you can actually pick out constellations with the pattern on the ceiling, it is a great nightlite for a little one.  Even had to heartily wash it after it got in the way when he had the flu, and haven\'t had any problems - it\'s been great!!  Would highly recommend as a night lite!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The lady bug is super cute and my girls loved watching the stars and moon on the ceiling each night, it made for great bedtimes, tv and lights off!  Sadly the red setting went first after a couple of months and now after six months only one setting works which is a little disappointing.I still gave it four stars as we really liked it when it was working and it isn\'t the most expensive toy on the planet.  I am on the fence whether to get a replacement.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this item for my daughter\'s 2nd birthday.  She had just moved to her own room and has recently become very interested in the night sky.  I thought this would aid in sleeping by herself plus she would get to see something she loves indoors.  It is really awesome!!!  The red doesn\'t show up as well but that\'s totally fine by us.  We prefer the blue anyway.  I love that it has the timer on it and stays on for quite a while after she goes to sleep.  I would definitely recommend this to others.  She loves it and shows it to anyone who comes to visit.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This product is fantastic except for a few things:1. The batteries get eaten up quickly, especially if it\'s used as a nightlight. The batteries ran out half way through the night and I was not going to put fresh ones in each night!2. The buttons are flimsy. One of ours broke off when the turtle was being played with.So, if you want to have a planetarium on your kids\' ceiling at night for a few minutes, it\'s great. If you want to use it as a nightlight, it\'s not great.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Love - Love - Love this product!! My 2.5 year old was resisting going to bed until the Twilight Turtle! Our bedtime routine now includes the turtle with stars/moon & she practically jumps into bed so she can lay there and fall asleep! I\'ve been so pleased I wrote about it on my blog and facebook page and had several other friends/family ask more about it so they could buy one for their kiddos. Great Product!The blue light shines the best & green is pretty good too. The orange light requires it be really dark to show up, but its my favorite for sleeping because I don\'t feel like it keeps her room too bright. However, I let my daughter pick what color each night and none seem to be too bright. She always falls asleep without making a fuss now! Quiet as a peep! :-)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Our son absolutely loves this!  Every night he has to put his turtle to bed with him and turn him on.  Great idea.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",my 3 year old nephew adores this thing it is not to rough for him to play with and works as an excellent night light and keeps him entertained. it also holds up to the sometimes brutal handling a three year old can dish out. i have not noticed anything that can really fit in his mouth or really concerns me but this.because of the plastic shell it can break! and that could be a potential problem i think using a light metal and a rubber coating would probably held up better for the shell than the plastic which can break admittedly it is rather difficult to break it but i imagine a few kids will find a way.i would consider this a strictly bedroom only toy for carpeted bedrooms so the shell wont break and possibly cause harm when you are not there. Not a toy to take outside or eat with because if it gets dirt it stays dirty which also means he/she shouldn\'t sleep with it in case they have an accident.all around a good interesting toy to keep them mentally stimulated and relaxed.My nephew did not like dark places at all and this really helped him he has relaxed over time so i have to say it is a nice transition easing device now turns off all the lights in his room during the day and turns on the turtle just to see the stars.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Great product at a very decent price. It has three different colors but they are a bit weak. Great for toddlers and young children. I recommend it.,3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Be aware that if you copse to buy the purple turtle with closed eyes, that\'s not what you\'ll get.  I paid extra and for shipping for that turtle and received the open eyes style. Thankfully, amazon had been easy to deal with in taking care of the return. Otherwise a cute item.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The first item I ordered for my son last week came with one of three lights not working right out of the box. I had to return the item (which basically made my son quite upset) and to order a same new item with 1-day shipping for extra charge. The second item arrived today and it has a pretty visible scratch on the top of the turtle\'s shell. It\'s quite obvious this is not the result of damage in transit, but rather very low quality control at the manufacturer.If it was an item for myself, I would have returned it right away again, because it\'s simply insane - tho hits and both with pretty obvious issues. I simply don\'t want to make my kid upset again, so I\'d better live with the scratch, but frankly I don\'t expect this light to last long. I would be very careful ordering anything from Cloud b in future as it seems that they don\'t care at all about the quality of what goes from them.Other than that, the whole concept of this light is wonderful. My son liked it really much and that\'s the reason of giving this 3 stars out of 5. From the pure quality point of view it does not deserve even one star, IMHO.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I have purchased Turtles for the newborn boys and Ladybugs for the newborn girls that have been added to our family over the past few years. The are well received and a bit unusual. My 6 year old grandson has both the turtle and the ladybug. He loves that they have different colors and shines them both on the ceiling at the same time. He does his own little light shows. My most recent purchase now resides in England with our new newborn granddaughter.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I don\'t even have children and I love this thing. The turtle itself is adorable and surprisingly light weight. It throws beautiful stars on your ceiling and walls. In blue, amber/yellow, or a green. Frankly the amber/yellow isn\'t as bright as I\'d like it, the stars are faint- but if you or your kid needs dimmer light, that\'s the color. The blue is a cobalt and is very calming. The green is a mild kelly green and is also very pretty. It shuts itself off, so no batteries wasted. I\'m a big fan of Cloud B products. They make really good gifts, and are quality enough to last and be heirloom toys.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 8-month-old son loves it. Some people said they can\'t see the yellow stars, but we can; even though my walls are beige. Its good when you want to put your kid in bed or just to play with it. Its a perfect gift for a little one.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is toy is absolutely outstanding. Children love it. It has very convenient features. When your child is in the bed trying to fell asleep and switched on the toy after some period of time it will turn off itself so you don\'t have to bother to come in and turn it off. It\'s very convenient you don\'t have to worry about it and you will not wake up your child entering the room.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",i did not get my product that was for my little cousins an they are very disappointed that they didnt get anything it said that it is in lathrop an it had past tracy were i live,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this as a gift for my friend.She loves it!It is really lovely and I even want to keep it for myself:P,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My almost 6 yr old son got this when he was 1 or 2 and it is still working great.  We\'ve replaced the batteries a few times, but since getting it, he started staying in his room easier and still  turns it on if he wakes up in the middle of the night.  My younger son is not as enthralled by the turtle (they each have one), but does like it.  He has never been as concerned about being in his room alone or in the dark like my first son. Great product.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is allegedly a child\'s amusement for their room.  But the truth is that it\'s a fascinating little turtle which projects stars onto the ceiling of he room.  Not only do the two grandsons love it (you must get one for each child or trouble in River City) every adult I\'ve shared it with wants one of their own.  Lots of fun.  Too cool.  Additionally, it can be a cozy, huggable turtle without twilight.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My child loves this night light!  It lights up his room with a moon and stars all over his ceiling and walls.  It is just the right amount of light and it automatically turns off after 45 minutes, so I don\'t have to worry about going back in to turn it off. We have used it every night since Christmas and the battery is still good!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son was so excited to get his twilight turtle.  He received it for doing well in swimming lessons and just loves it.  My only complaint is the amber is really not able to be seen well so we don\'t use it, but other than that it is really a neat idea.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I was a little worried about how much light it would put out.  I was really impressed, the stars cover the entire ceiling.  You can change the colors and it works so much better than I thought it would.  My son is finally sleeping in his own bed!  :)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I really like the Twilight Turtle but the amber lights can barely be seen on the ceiling.  We have to use the green or blue.  The blue is definately the brightest (not too bright) so we use it the most.  The green is pretty good as well. Unfortunately, the amber is so light that we can\'t use it.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We bought this for our now 20 month old son as a night light and not only has the beautiful light display helped him sleep all this time, but this turtle is now his favorite snuggle buddy",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My children love the ladybug and turtle that we have.  each child can turn on thier light and veiw the stars or look at the colors depending on thier ages.  Great product and I love the timer aspect of it!Great Job!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 4 year old and 1 year old love this turtle!  They love looking at the stars every night, and choosing which color they want them to be (red, blue, green).  It automatically turns off after so long, so the batteries don\'t run out right away.  Overall, it\'s a great night light for my little boys!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Our child loves this Twilight Turtle! Works as a nice little nightlight and you can also teach your little one the constellations or practice counting the stars. Also changes colours to keep it different.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Three different color stars projected on the ceiling.  It really is neat.  Only issue I have with it, it works best when on the floor in the center of room.  What kid wants to leave their stuffed animal in the middle of the floor at night.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We just picked up the Twilight Turtle for ourselves and the Twilight Ladybug for a friend.  The turtle is great, no complaints here. Regardless if we put the turtle on the floor, window seal or dresser we get and excellent display, it all depends on what size stars you want.  At any level the turtle emits a nice pattern of stars and they are crisp, much better than expected.  The turtle arms and legs are fluffy and the shell portion is light, and not at all bulky.  I do not think this item would make for a good snugly friend.  The illumination is bright enough for my wife to leave on at night to check on our infant without being bright enough to wake him.  I think it would also do well for little ones who are less fond of being alone in the dark.  Our friends were also very excited and said they had never seen such a nicer thing.  I will be purchasing another turtle for my sister and her baby.  You will not be dissapointed!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought the Twilight Turtle for my niece\'s birthday. She absolutely loves it. It is very peaceful at bedtime looking at the stars. I think newborns to grade school children would enjoy this little turtle.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","When this night light is turned on the room is lit up with stars that cover the ceiling and walls.  It is the best night light ever.  My grand daughter loves it.  It is not just for kids, when I showed it to my 82 year old neighbor she asked me to order one for her and she uses it every night and loves it.  You push a button to choose the color you want your stars to be (blue, green or amber)  The light shuts off automatically.  This is a wonderful product, I highly recommend it.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The only problem we have at all with this product is that it does, from time to time, run out of batteries. Our son loves it so very much, he would not dream of going to bed with out it. He talks to it at night, and has learned how to turn it on over and over again until he falls asleep. Projects a very well defined set of stars and moons on the ceiling and walls. If I\'m being honest I wouldn\'t mind having one myself. It is a bit fragile, however. We were letting our son \'cry it out\' at night, and he rewarded us by throwing everything in the bed out. The Cloud B Blue Twilight Turtle fared well for the first night However, after repeated abuse has stopped fading from color to color. It flashes now, I assume it is on the way out. We will get a new one for sure. Our son now sleeps soundly through the night and has ceased throwing all items out of the bed.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 4 year old loves this toy. He loves changing the star colors- really lights the room. The red/amber not so bright though.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 15 mo. old daughter loves this light.  It only takes her a few minutes to settle down at night to go to sleep now that she has the moon and stars to look at.  When she\'s really tired and doesn\'t even want to read any books before bed she will point at the ladybug then at her crib to tell us she wants to go to bed!  This has greatly enhanced our going to bed routine.  For naps when it\'s light out we turn on the red color which is more of a night light/glowing mode and at night we use the blue stars mode.  She figured out quickly how to work it and turns it on herself.  I only wish we\'d bought this sooner!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I purchased this for my kids to share (18m and 4 years) and have decided now I have to order the turtle as well.  It is so nice and soothing, I honestly wish I\'d gotten it much earlier... love it.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I can see why people complain about the low light of several of the colors and do not disagree. However, when displayed in a dark room on the green setting my nephew (and we) absolutely love it. It creates the coolest galaxy effect around the ceiling and walls. I find it very calming and soothing and fortunately so does the kid!I do not see how people would use this for an educational toy. Perhaps you just have to have a room with the right dimensions to actually make out the constellations but we haven\'t really seen them very clearly yet. Fun toy though.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Bought this for our new baby but all the kids love it!!  Very happy with this purchase!  Just wish it had music too.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We just recently decided to try letting our 2 year old daughter go to sleep on her own, so after reading other reviews, we tried the Ladybug. It\'s been over a month, and she hasn\'t had any problems falling asleep like a ""big girl"". And hearing her say ""COOOOL"" every night when we turn out the lights to see the stars never gets old. I only wish it would stay on longer, or even all night, but for the most part, this product is great great great!!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I have bought 4 of these twilight turtles two as gifts and the other two for my sons (age 2 & 4)These are cute and VERY durable and have stood up to lots of traveling....We bring them everywhere!I love how there\'s an automatic shut off and the light that it emits is perfect for promoting sleep.They are so easy to use which means when my boys wake in the night they can turn them on themselves.I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone with kids, and it makes a wonderful baby shower gift!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I got this for Christmas for my new born niece.  It\'s really cute, and much better quality than the pillow pet versions.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My babyy really liked it & he gets entertained by it ! He is scared of the dark when im driving & hes alone in the back ! So the turtle really helps .,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My little girl loves all the different colors, she even loves to hold the turtle, we even purchased the lady bug because she loved it so much.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I got this for my daughters 3rd birthday. It is so adorable both her and I love it. It illuminates stars and a moon all over her room (Her walls and her ceiling) It has 3 colors blue, green and red. Definitely worth the money! It is battery operated so no need to worry about the outlet.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We got this to help our son unwind and relax in his bedroom at night. He tends to be constantly on the go, and will continue to jump around and avoid sleep as long as possible. This toy shows stars and a moon all around the room, and one setting changes colors and is just cool and relaxing to watch. It definitely helps him relax each night!",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We have both the Mocha Turtle, and Ladybug Cloud B night lights, one for each of my daughters - one is 9 years and one is  9 months and they both use them every night!The thing I love most about them (other than how cute they are!) is how long the lights stay on. Both girls are asleep by the time they switch off. They are not too bright but the room is filled with a nice glow from all the stars all over the ceiling/wall.The Turtle glows blue, yellow and green and has an option to cycle through the colours automatically. The Ladybug does NOT have this option and I didn\'t realise it at the time, and was a little disappointed to find out, though it\'s more my fault for not reading carefully. Ladybug can glow red, blue or green.The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the batteries (3 x AAA) don\'t last as long as I\'d like before the lights start getting dim. The turtle will stay yellow and just flash instead of cycling when the batteries start getting low. The ladybug seems to run the batteries down slightly faster than the turtle, not sure why.Overall though, I do love them and would recommend these beautiful nightlights. I actually want to get another one for myself :)",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Even though I bought this turtle for my 9 month old son, my 4 year old daughter loves it at night. She can pick the color of the stars, and it automatically turns off after 45 minutes. It doesn\'t play music and the stars don\'t move like I thought they would, but I\'m glad I bought it.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son loved the product for the one day it was fully functional.  On day 2, he tried to turn on the star lights and the button fell right into the turtle, rendering the whole thing useless.  The buttons are very flimsy, and if your child puts slightly more pressure on the buttons then necessary, they will snap right off, and it is not possible to reattach.",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this as a gift for a 6month old. She is now 2 years old and still loves this turtle.  A great gift for any little one.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My boys love playing with this at night.  The closer you have it to the ceiling, the clearer the stars are.  A fun toy and useful night light.  Had no problems seeing the auburn like some people...depends on how much darkness is in the room.  Breakable? You\'d have to try pretty hard.  It\'s not as fragile as one reviewer led me to believe.  Just don\'t let your kids stand on it.  :)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I expected more from this product.  I ordered a similar product (the blue turtle) and it plays music and the water moves with it.  I would recommend the blue turtle over this one any day.  This product does what it says, but it is kind of cheesy.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I haven\'t given this to my Grandson as yet but I\'ve opened it and checked it out and I\'m sure it\'ll be a hit. I\'m looking forward to Christmas to give it and can\'t wait. I had fun myself and set it up in my own room... It\'ll be fun to see his face when he gets to use it... I know he\'ll love it as I did.Nana,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I got this for my girlfriend\'s birthday and now we just can\'t sleep without stars on our ceilings. This thing is great. It is the little things in life that make it special and our twilight turtle is one of them. Get one for everyone.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This lady bug was a hit. It has become a regular at bed time and the lights work great! Recommended!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","These dream lights are great, but get one that is a bit softer, like the puppy.  This one has too much plastic.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I seen this product and knew that my wife would love it. This product is already in our baby room.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","When one of my grandkids asked for this for her birthday, I was doubtful... it did not look cuddly to me!.  I thought it might be a &#34;fad&#34; thing and soon be put on the shelf.  So I hesitated at first.  Well, I was wrong.  I have 8 grandkids in all, and so far this is my 4th one that I have purchased because they all want one- both the girls and boys.  After the lights are tuned off at night, they can turn on the turtle and look at the constellations on the ceiling.  When the kids come to our home for an &#34;overnight&#34; they bring their turtles with them!  They seem to be of good quality and the 2 things I appreciate the most are as follows:  1.  It comes with batteries already to go!  and 2. It has an automatic turn off, so if the child falls asleep with it on, it will turn itself off after a certain amount of minutes.  Oh, and I should mention that it has different color selections too, so the light that casts the constellations onto the ceiling can appear in several colors.  Kids like that feature.  I have to admit, I play with it too.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son loves this- we got it for him when he was 4.  Recently bought another one for our other child.  I\'m planning on buying one for our nephew as well.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","my 3 year old loves his turtle and the stars.  Not too bright, the timer is convenient  He won\'t go to bed without it anymore",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this product for my daughter who is a young adult going to have a baby. She feel in love with it and had to have it. So I purchased it as a baby gift. She likes that it lights up the room and can be used as a soothing night light and she likes the turtle it is one of her favorite animals. Also I like that it is light weight so the baby will be able to play with it after it is old enough to hold on to. oh this is about the shipping from amazon..I love the air pockets you put in the box\'s now it is so much better than those messy peanuts.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift and I think it was just as loved (if not more) than her princess dress! She loves the different colors to choose from but loves the blue the best. She has a small room so it fills the walls and ceiling. I will definitely be buying one for our boys room next.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My husband and I bought this for our 3-1/2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it and uses it every night. I think we are going to buy a second one for our house.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I would like to say it was a hit.  My daughter just loves it.  It was exactly what I had expected.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I got this along with the Lady bug for my little niece and nephew, Wow, did they love it. They kept taking everyone into the bathroom, to turn off the light to ""see the stars and moon""  Highly recommend it!!  Still getting reports of how much they love it at bedtime!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","In a family with over thirty first cousins, you end up having lots of kids running around needing presents. For some reason, this Constellation Night Light turtle was a HUGE hit with the kids.I have purchased four of these turtles so far in the last two years, and the children always love them. While I\'m unsure about the soft plushiness combined with the plastic shell and a light source inside, the kids don\'t seem to mind and actually enjoy the turtle lying around their room at night, shining lights up onto the ceiling.If you\'ve got small kids who are fussy at night, give this a shot. You might find that you\'ll be buying yourself one - or at least sneaking it into your room once in a while.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 3 year old girl loves this thing. I take good care of this thing because i don\'t know what would happen if it broke . Probably have to buy another one and have it shipped one day express. weve had it about two months and still works fine. Bed time is much easier. I am back to edit my review. changed from 5 to 4 stars. My girl used the lady bug for about seven months and it quit working. Maybe she dropped it one to many times, i don\'t know.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We bought this for our youngest and its great! It gives just a little light in her room for us when we check on her and give her something to look at as she falls asleep.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This was a hit with my three year old granddaughter.  She loves the the stars all over her room and she goes to sleep every night with it on.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Gives children something to look at in their room at night and is educational with the constellations as well.  Also provides a small amount of light.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son is almost two and loves this turtle!  It\'s great because it turns itself off so if he hits it on again in the middle of the night, which he does, it won\'t kill the batteries.  He likes picking the different colors and playing &#34;Where\'s the moon?&#34;",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",A friend of mine got this to my daughter and she love it so much that now I got it as a birthday gift,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My grandson loved the light.  It is just perfect for his personality and he really enjoyed it a great deal.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The blue and green colors show up great on my daughters walls, the amber color shows up just a little bit. I\'m very happy with this purchase and my daughter uses it every night.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Kids love it. Lights up the room creating &#34;night sky&#34; of stars on the ceiling. Almost too bright on some of the colors.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I received this today.  Took it out and turned it on, not impressed.  Like other reviewers stated, you really have to have just the right place to put this.  I would say a high dresser right near the bed.  I couldn\'t make out any of the constellations.  The only thing this product really does, is show some stars on the ceiling.So, for me personally, and this is just my opinion that I am leaving this review on:Pros:  Shows stars on the ceiling if placed just right.  Colors aren\'t very bright, but if you have a pitch black room, you can make out the different colors.Cons:  That\'s all it does.  No music.  The stars don\'t revolve.  The constellations don\'t really make sense.  Also, I don\'t know why, but I guess I thought the shell of the ladybug would be softer.  It\'s just hard plastic.  In addition, you have to be careful how you look at this thing because if you catch it just \'wrong\' it shines into your eye.  Not something to put into bed with a child, or at eye level.I feel for this much money, it should do more than show some star shapes on the ceiling.I am going to purchase some glow in the dark plastic stars and attach those to the ceiling.  They won\'t need batteries or lights replaced.  Will also buy an inexpensive nightlight.",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is such a cute gift.  Purchased for my granddaughter.  The description on the website is precise.  The light is perfect for a toddlers bedroom.  Good purchase.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This was purchased for my grandson.  However his DAD loves it and is usinf it as the baby is only 3 months old...He will need to give it to the baby soon...,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I love this turtle. It is cuddly, easy to use, durable for a child who likes to have it in bed, and it projects stars! who wouldn\'t want that right? lol, I gave a review for this on my blog because it was so great to me. I would say it\'s a bit expensive but it actually shows real constellations. It comes with a map to read them, you can color choices, it turns off on it\'s own  once you put your child to bed, my son LOVES it and so it was worth every penny. I don\'t have any cons or dissapointments with this product. I would buy it again without a doubt.another great plus is that it\'s easy to travel with. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I gave this night light turtle to my 4yr old grandson for Christmas. He absolutely loved it! He is fascinated with all of the stars and counts them until he falls asleep. The different colors that it can project is nice and it also comes with batteries! For the first time, I didn\'t have to run out and buy batteries to include with the gift! I highly recommend this product!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I like ladybugs and this one is a cutie.  My granddaughter is fascinated with the stars so I think she will love this in her room.  I would definitely recommend it.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We bought this for our youngest son just after Christmas. Both of my sons actually love it. My oldest runs in to turn it on every night and there have been some nights I wake up and find that my oldest turned it on again as it shuts off after some time. We use it every night and I changed the batteries for the first time about 2 weeks ago and we\'ve had it probably 4.5 months now which I think is pretty good!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Great night light, helped to ease my son into falling asleep on his own.  The amber is a little faint, the other two colors are great.  My only recommendation would be to make the lights change.  Overall great product.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I haven\'t had any problems with any of the colors not showing up on our light tan walls. The amber, blue and gree all show up great. I personally find the green to be the most relaxing. I love to turn this on while I rock my kids, it is so neat to look at. The timer is the best feature so I can just leave it on for my 3 year old while she falls asleep. LOVE it! I\'m going to start giving these as gifts.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for a 5 year old family friend and she loves it! I kind of really want one for myself...,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My child loves her ladybug, and I think it\'s really cool. The red doesn\'t show up as well as the blue or green, especially when it\'s not centered in middle of the room, but I\'m afraid to leave it on the floor and risk someone falling over or stepping on and breaking. And my toddler insists on red since that\'s the only color she\'s ever seen a ladybug be. I put up on the dresser against the wall, so the red doesn\'t shine on all the walls, but she doesn\'t mind. The blue and green look really great, even when next to the wall, but like I said, she doesn\'t want those colors right now, lol. It has a 45 minute timer which is perfect for bedtime. Sometimes it will go off while she is still awake, but she knows how to turn it back on. We told her to be careful with and not play with it so it doesn\'t break, and she leaves it right on the dresser.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I researched similar toys/products for hours before finally deciding to order this one for my 3 year old nephew for Christmas.  I almost went for the $100-150.00 range thinking that a true ""scientific"" accurate product was better than a lower cost ""kiddie"" item - Boy was I wrong! My nephew is crazy for this and so are his parents - the stars are actually star-shaped and big/bright enough to really make an impact.  He loves being able to change the colors and have some control at bedtime - and when storytime is over he knows that if he\'s ""not tired"" he can stay awake and look at the stars for as long as he wants (the 45 minute timer is perfect - he hasn\'t been able to last more than 20 minutes so far).  He got sooooo many presents for Christmas - who knows which ones will last and which ones will just sit on the shelf forgotten - I know for sure that he will use this one every night.  His little brother just turned 2 the day after Christmas and his mom is going to order a turtle for him so when he moves from the crib to his ""big boy"" bed in a couple of months he will have the same bedtime routine as his big brother.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son really didn\'t like it he used it for a little while but he doesn\'t use it now! I think it was a waste of money,2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Our 4 month old loves this.  She if stares at it with amazement.  I think it feels pretty well made so I\'m happy overall,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Only took a few days to get and I love it cause I couldn\'t find the purple one in any stores. Work exactly like it says. Very pleased,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","If I had one complaint, it is that it turns off after 45 minutes. It helps light up the room at night and sometimes when my daughter wakes up she is scared of the dark.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I love this product!  Even though I purchase as a gift for 3 of my granddaughters, if I didn\'t think my husband would kill me, I would purchase one for my room!  They are adorable!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son is 2 1/2 and went through a stage where he was terrified of the dark. His nightlight I used stopped working and I couldn\'t find anything else that would suit him. I heard about this product from the daycare provider and I\'m so glad I ordered it! Every night my son has to have it on the blue setting but I love that there are other color options too. The on and off switch is easy for him to find and he is so proud of being able to do it himself. I also love that there is a timer set on it. We\'ve had it for a while now and haven\'t had to touch the batteries once. I highly suggest this item!! It\'s very sturdy and child friendly. As far as him being able to fall asleep with this on, I haven\'t had any problems with it. He likes to look at his blue stars and falls asleep in no time.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I have had this turtle for 4 years. My kid 4 year old and 1 year old love this. Depending on where you put it in the room it has a really nice effect of showing the stars and the moon on the ceiling in a dark room.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The color is a horrible brown, not like in the picture. Its eyes and mouth are straight line, and look slightly evil. It also says you can plug it in instead of use batteries but did not include the cord. Very cheap quality! I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone!",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I was skeptical about this at first, thinking it wouldn\'t light up my daughter\'s room very much at all, but I was completely wrong! The turtle itself is very soft and cozy. The shell lights up with purple, green, and amber. The purple shows up the best because of the shell color. Our daughter is three months old and was sleeping in our bedroom until a week ago (due to some issues getting a crib to an APO address) and would cry until we turned on some sort of light. The stars cover her entire ceiling, and it\'s not too bright but not too dim. She stares at the stars until she falls asleep every night now. This is a must have item for a new baby!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","While working, my son loves the turtle. Wish it were a bit brighter but still very nice. After having it 6 months, the green and purple lights stopped working and the orange only stays for about 5 seconds. Changing the batteries did not fix it. Their website blames it on batteries but I\'m seeing online that this is pretty common!",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",my  son loves looking at the stars while we eat his night time bottle. he is 3 months old and has really started to notice them. he talks to the stars while im getting stuff ready for bed! it\'s great entertainment,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my 3 yr. old daughter and it was a hit! When it first arrived, it was during the day and not dark enough to see the stars. We took it into our bathroom and spent half the day in there looking at the stars! I recommend this to any one with little ones, and especially if they love the moon and stars. It would really help babies and toddlers who are having sleep issues. They could learn to enjoy bedtime w/ this product.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 2 boys trade of on this every other night. It is awesome seeing the stars in there room, I even lay in there longer just looking at them. It is a great temporary night light for them.We were at a friends house one time and my 3 yr old was going to spend the night with my friends 3 boys. He was crying because he wanted to go home, really he was just scared, anyway I pulled the Turtle out and turn it on and the other kids thought it was soo cool this got my son to stop crying and he was happy being there with it. Made that night, and many other nights very peaceful.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Purchased ahead of time for our baby girl who came in November. We ended up purchasing a purple one at BuyBuyBaby...price was about the same but less at BuyBuyBaby without the shipping.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Four stars because this product is pretty expensive for what it is.  It would be worth the price if there was a sound option included. My son loves it though.Pros:-light weight-choice of colors-perfect amount of light in a dark room-cuteCons:-expensive-auto shut off...I think there needs to be an option to leave it on all night-no soundI\'d recommend it, but there is room for improvement.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My little girl got this for Christmas and loved it. It is cute and came ready to go. Great buy.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","this turtle is adorable and my daughter (2 years old) was amazed when i turned it on.  all 3 colors show up on her ceiling just fine.  the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i wish it had the option to stay on all night. and would be even better to have the option to plug it in instead of using batteries.  I need to have an additional night light in her room because she gets scared if she wakes up in the middle of the night and there is no night light.  when she gets older, i\'ll let her keep it by her bed so she can turn it on by herself if she wakes up. she\'s not old enough for that yet so it stays on the dresser.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I gave this to my friend\'s little girl on her 2nd birthday and she is absolutely in love with it.  The colors and the stars really spark her imagination and she refuses to go to sleep without it and even sings an unrecognizable little song to the turtle every night, its soooo cute.  I\'m going to give this gift over and over again to every child\'s\' birthday party I go to, it\'s a HUGE hit.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I decided to buy this Twilight Turtle after about 2-3 months of bedtime hell with my 2 1/2 year old.  I tried everything prior to buying it.  Tweaking her bedtime routine, moving dinner earlier, cutting out late evening snacks.  Still she would be jumping up and down in her bed at 9:30 (after starting bedtime routine at 8), finally asleep by 10pm.  This turtle was a last resort in my attempt to get my little darling to calm down enough to zonk out by 9:30.....and it WORKED!  We explained that the turtle would help her fall asleep and even gave it a name--Tulip.  It has been about 2 months now and the difference has been night and day.  No more lollygagging, no more excuses to get out of bed for the 10th time, no more jumping around.  She grabs Tulip, turns on the stars (her fav is purple) and gets in bed and is alseep BEFORE 9:30.  The light is soothing, looking at the stars calms her and just lulls her to sleep.  The good thing about this turtle is she will enjoy it for years to come!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Super cute!  My daughter is so happy to have received this lovely ladybug as a gift!  It projects so nicely, and the colors are gorgeous!  The automatic shut-off is great for conserving batteries, which makes me happy!  We highly recommend this soothing nightlight!  :)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 4 year old Grandson just loves this Night Light. This Turtle travels with him.  Mommy and Daddy think this is one of the best Items PA PA has ever given him.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 2 grandsons really loved this gift and it was at a great price.  It helps get them to sleep at night!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Arrived on time, this is the second one I have given as a gift. They are a huge hit! Parents and older kids like them too.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He just loves it. Such a sweet turtle. Shopping Amazon is the only way to go.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This product didn\'t work from the moment it first arrived. Only the red light would light up not the green or blue. It is the first thing I have ordered and been totally disappointed with and had to send back. Not worth it at all- wish I wouldve read all the reviews before buying!,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We bought the Twilight Sea Turtle for our son\'s 2nd birthday and it was a huge hit with both our 2 yr old and 4 yr old. I had wanted to get one for our oldest son, a few years ago, but never got around to it. Since he loved his brother\'s so much we bought him the Twilight Turtle for Christmas.My only regret is that I didn\'t buy this 2 years ago when I had first looked at them. It has helped them fall asleep and has made our 4 year old less afraid of the dark. I highly recommend this!If given a choice between the Twilight Turtle and the Twilight Sea Turtle, I prefer the Twilight Turtle. It shines twice as many stars, has more colors and it\'s brighter than the Sea Turtle.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I saw this and had to get it for my daughters room. Well she is 10 months now and we are on our third one...this is not a good thing.  The first one we got shorted itself out and we tried to fix it but forget it...also we must have gotten an older version because the second I bought was awesome- was so much brighter and you could make out the stars.  The second one did not last very long and this one sucked down batteries and again shorted out with in two months. We received one as a gift for christmas- which was fine...so far it\'s worked but still sucking down batteries. It\'s super cute and when the batteries aren\'t dying the light is perfect. Make sure you get a newer model if anything.,2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for a night light for my daughter\'s room and since her room is done in Ladybugs, it is perfect.  Love the different colors and how it turns off after a while on its own.  Love how it puts stars on her ceiling, she really likes it.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",It was exactly as I expected. My nephew had it and loves it so I bought it for my two year old who also loves it now.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Thought my year old was a little too young for this but he LOVES it.  He pushes all the buttons to turn on/off and changes the colors.  He looks at the stars on the ceiling and oohs and aahs.  The brown/yellow is a little too dim for the ceiling but if he has it in his crib this is perfect when he goes to bed since it\'s not too bright.  Great price too - cheaper than in the stores!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this so I wouldnt have to stick glow in the dark stars on the ceiling. Our little one is to small to enjoy it, but his parents love it! Great little gift!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Very good product. It came fast,  and everyone loves it even my grandmother. Its exactly as I imagined. I would like to buy some more in a future!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Overall my two daughters love these. We purchased one for my 3 year old for Christmas and my 20 month old loved it so much that we ended up ordering her one as well. They are durable enough that I feel comfortable leaving them with them overnight. It provides a decent amount of light, but my 3 year old still requires her lamp on during the night to ease her fear of the dark. So it doesn\'t do what I wanted it to do. Also we only had the first ladybuy for about 3 days when the green light stopped working. I haven\'t opened it up yet to see if it\'s just a bulb we can replace, but it seems this is a recurring problem for some customers.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Even though this night isn\'t what I expected it to be, my daughter still loves it and uses it every night. It has three color options, red, blue, and green. The red and green are pretty much useless unless your walls are painted black. The night light features a timer, which goes off probably 15mins after being turned on. It is a disadvantage really, because sometimes it takes my daughter awhile to fall asleep and she lets me know when it goes off. Another downside is that the stars do not move.  The ladybug nightlight would be perfect if it did not shut off unless it was turned off, if the stars rotated, and if the red and green where changed to yellow and pink or other lighter colors.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","great product!  Our 2 year old grandson has a star-type light at his home, but he was going to be visiting us.  this cloud blue turtle is sweet as a stuffed- type toy, but great as a star projector/light.  he loved it!  we totally recommend it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought it for my 2-year old daughter.  She loves it.  We would find the moon together every night. It\'s fun.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","NO timer on it , so we had to turn it off manually . Very inconvenient . Our grandson is a light sleeper . So his parents don\'t like to go into his room to turn this off after he\'s asleep for fear of waking him up. Consequently , it is not used.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Bright in blue and green lights, needs to go above bed. Orange is very warm and calming.  My child loves it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I BOUGHT THIS FOR GRANDSON,  HE LOVED IT.  IT GIVES SUCH A RELAXING GLOW TO THE ROOM THAT I ACTUALLY GOT ONE FOR MYSELF.  I WISH IT CAME IN A MORE ADULT VERSION, BUT I LOVE IT ANYWAY",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We bought three of these for our kids this Christmas. They have been a huge hit! I like that there are more stars than the ""Dream Lite"" and they are less expensive as well. My kids LOVE them, and I love that it helps them handle their fear of the dark. They now have power over the dark, and I love that!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My kids are actually older than the intended audience but I bought this product because I saw it in action and it works so well.  I  have bought my kids so many other similar products and they don\'t give nearly as good of an effect as this one does.  It is also really sturdy.  They are 9 & 10 years old so they may hid it when their friends come over but they love it.  I am amazed by the great star effect it provides.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","this little guy isn\'t so little he\'s actually rather large... but he is cute and the lights are just bright enough so you can see but not interrupt your sleep. my daughter likes it but shes really interested in touching it and throwing it, i guess I\'ll find out how durable it is. It\'s mostly a good product for the money I just didn\'t realize how large this thing really is.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I thought this product was the coolest thing for a babies room.  It was a gift to a friend\'s baby and they love it and have it in her nursery.  I almost want one for my own room.I am always happy with anything I have ever pruchased from Amazon.com.  THey have never let me down and I know that they can be relied on for great, innovative products and excellent customer service.  Amazon is my go-to site for just about everything I am looking for and I also use them as a searching tool.  If Amazon doesn\'t have it, then it probably isn\'t out there.  I love Amazon.com.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We got this turtle when my son was only 6 months old. For awhile he was to young to fully appreciate it, i would even say it was distracting. But,about age 3 he started having trouble falling asleep. We brought out the turtle and he loves it! He uses it at nap time and night time. The amber stars (yellow) are quite faint, but the green and blue are very nice. My son uses the blue most of the time. He likes to sleep with the moon directly over his bed. This is a very durable product, he is a big and tall boy, (56 lbs) and he has stood on it many times (even though he knows better!) and the turtle shows no wear and tear. We liked the turtle so much, we have bought the pink lady bug one for our daughter. Really helps with independent falling asleep.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Yes, it\'s true the amber colored stars really do not show up but the other do. I have a very fussy baby, who still has his days and nights mixed up. However, last night as I was trying to calm him down, we turned off all the lights in the room and turned on the turtle. Since he is just now able to see things far away, he was completely fascinated by the glowing turtle and also by the stars he could see on the wall closest to him. Needless to say he passed out within 5 minutes (after cooing and giggling, which he has never done before), slept for 6 hours, when he woke I just flipped on the turtle again and he went right back to sleep.Needless to say, I love this turtle.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Have bought two of these, one for each of my daughters children.  Works great as nightlight and both families use them nightly.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Our grandson loves to turn it on at night and go to sleep while it is on. Gives a tranquil feeling.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  He loves it.  I love it too.  The stars on the ceiling remind me of my sleeping-outdoors-under-the-stars-days.  I want one for my bedroom!!!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Before giving the little Turtle night lite to our grandson for his birthday, my husband and I tried it out in our bedroom.  It felt so soothing, we just loved it and can\'t wait to give it to him.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","When I come for a visit, I share a room with my granddaughter. I couldn\'t sleep with the glaring wall nightlight she had and she\'d cry if I turned it off, so I needed a solution.I was so happy when the Cloud b constellation nightlight arrived and I could actually see that it was soft and just bright enough that my granddaughter was able to fall asleep, and not so bright that it kept me awake. Now she falls asleep hugging it across her chest. She loves that she can choose the light color and that 45 minute timer saves on batteries. The added bonus was that it mimics actual constellations and the little book it comes with explains them. Functional and educational. I\'ve seen similar toys at Wal-Mart, but these by far are so much better! There is something so soothing about watching the stars before falling asleep.On my next visit, I asked my granddaughter if she liked her new nightlight.  She said, ""Grandma, I LOVE it!"" That\'s good enough for me.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I got this as a xmas present for my 5 yr old grandson & 2 yr old granddaughter (they share a bedroom).  It\'s not what I expected.  My grandson is interested in the constellations & I thought we could look at it together & find the constellations (it says it shows 8 of them).  We tried it placing it on the floor, & then on a dresser.  Either way it shows a quarter moon, & stars all over the ceiling & walls.  The stars don\'t look like real stars though -- they look like the 5 pointed star you would draw.  The only way it looks like real stars is if you put it up to only a few inches from the ceiling.  And that way you might be able to find some constellations, but who\'s going to be holding it up to the ceiling.  So, I wasdisappointed, & so was my grandson because I\'d told him it would show the constellations.  Still, he likes it, likes changing the colors.  My granddaughter likes it too.  Wish it were more realistic & that you could see the constellations.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Perfect for my 3 month old he watches it!!. Do not know what i would do without it. U have to get one,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We have been using our turtle for a little over a year now. Our turtle has been part of our nightly routine (and sometimes naptime), every night since purchase, and I have only changed the batteries once. Our son is almost two years old and he loves seeing the stars on his ceiling at night. He began noticing, and becoming super interested in, the real stars in the night sky around a year ago. So bedtime is just a little more exciting when we can tell our child to &#34;go turn on your stars.&#34; Clearly, the shell is hard plastic so this is more of a stationary \'toy\'. Don\'t expect much cuddling with your turtle. The nightlight does turn off after a certain amount of time, but that does save battery life. There is no option to keep it on all night. However, if your child is a little older, it is very easy to operate if they want to turn it back on. We have had no problem with visibility of the stars and they project onto our standard-height ceiling just fine. I\'m very happy with this purchase and foresee our turtle being part of the family for a very long time.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My little 2 year old loves it! We got it for his birthday and now he\'ll ask that we put it on every night before he goes to bed. Sometimes, he\'ll even wake up at night and fuss because it\'s not on :)",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My daughter has one of these guys that I bought from babies r us a year ago for almost double the price! I ordered this one a couple weeks ago for my son and it\'s EXACTLY THE SAME as the Cloud b Twilight Turtle I bought from Babies R US, but for half the price. I am ordering 2 more of these from here as X-mas presents for my niece and nephew :) All the little ones in our family (ages 1,4,6,8) LOVE this turtle! Other reviews mention ""knock offs"" being sold from ""Zeetron"" but I\'m thinking the problem has been corrected as now the seller is Planet Stuff, LLC  and they sent me the real deal!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought the turtle twice now, one for my godchild and one for a friends daughter. Both kids just love the turtle and since the stars are correct enjoy learning as well.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","First, the plusses:  The constellations are very cool. It comes with a detailed booklet which describes each one and locates them right on the turtle.  The booklet also comes with a cute little story about a turtle finding his way home by looking at the stars.  My only two complaints are (1) that it\'s not as cuddly as I hoped, because the plastic shell covers pretty much the entire top side and it\'s quite hard, and (2) the amber setting is very dim; so dim that it\'s not even worth using.  With my daughter, it was a fascinating toy for about a week, and then it quickly joined the pile of unfavorites.  For a soft, cuddly, glowing sleeping pal, you might first consider a glow worm or a glow Winnie the Pooh.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","this little guy has solved any bedtime struggles I\'ve had with two boys. they love the star pattern on the ceiling, and searching for the crescent moon has now become a cherished game. the batteries last forever, and the timed automatic shutoff function is great. Best $ ever spent on a night light, seriously.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this as a flower girl gift for my 5 year-old niece.  She loves it.  My sister even caught her trying to take it in the bathtub with her recently.  It is one of her favorite toys!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",when the kids first got this they loved it. I will eventually get one of those pillow pets that light up for each child so they don\'t have to share the lady bug,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My daughter stays in her bed at bedtime now.  She likes the variety of colors it displays and we are glad we got it.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","it makes a nice night light, it was a present for my grand daughter, she loves it. She likes to show it off to every one",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Makes a nice canopy of stars with a moon, the blue and green light will cover ceiling and walls of a large size room, the red just reflects on the ceiling and is less impressive, but at the same time it gives the room a warm atmosphere.It changes colors manually and turns off automatically after 45 minutes.I think is a bit pricey for so little features, but it is worth it when the reaction to the blue light of my 2 year old daughter was looking around and exclaimed :""wooooow!!!""",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is great for calming the fears of a little one when bedtime is near.  Lovely display covers the ceiling.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","After a post-Christmas cold, my grandson had developed the habit of sleeping restlessly and getting out of bed in the middle of the night. We sent him this toy because his parents thought he\'d like it and it looked interesting, but it has proven to be very effective at giving him something to do if he does wake up. Consequently, the whole family is getting a better rest since its purchase! We hope it will last a long time.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is awesome!  My grandson carried it around all afternoon. We had to darken every room so he could show it to everyone!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My grand daughter absolutely loves this night light.  She uses is every night!  Would highly recommend this product for any child who has a fear of the dark.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",this was the perfect gift for my nephew to brighten up his room at night.  It is very cute and useful too,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son loves looking at all the stars. It has different colors which is great. It stays on for just the right amount of time till he falls asleep.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The only reason I didn\'t give this 5 stars is because the amber color isn\'t that great. We have 1 turtle for each of our daughters, ages 6 and 3, and they both love it. They like to set it on their beds and sleep with it near their feet. Get it, you shouldn\'t be disapointed.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Was great while it worked.  My 1yr old loved it, but it died on us really quick.  Tried to change the batteries that I believe were included, but you first have get past the screw securing the batteries.  That required using a scewdriver and needle nose pliers simultaneously. Once I had access to the batteries I found they were corroded in there pretty well.  I tried to just wipe it down, but new batteries just didn\'t work.  Then I tried to take the whole plastic compartment out in the hopes of giving it a better cleaning and seeing if there was something else wrong, only to find out the rest of the screws were basically just holding back the stuffing and there is no way of taking it apart.  Just threw it away at that point.",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My 2.5 son absolutely has fallen in love with his turtle. He loves to turn on all of the different colored lights and changes it on various color settings. He loves the stars that light up the ceiling in the dark. It also helps him to fall asleep on his own at night too. A great buy!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My daughter loves this adorable lady bug and goes to bed with it every night. It is so fun to look at the stars together.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We bought this for our baby son but ended up using it in our room too!  It is so calming and beautiful to have the stars on the ceiling.  The timer feature is great so you can sleep with it on and it goes off within a set time.  It is a great way to get up and feed and change the baby without waking up the other person because you have to turn the lights on too.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Features:-It shuts itself off automatically in about a half hour after turning it on.-The body of the turtle is very soft (the back is hard though)-The lights are soft (a great plus since, let\'s face it, kids are going to get as close to it as possible) and doesn\'t seem to hurt the eyes.-It has three light colors to choose from: blue, green, and amber-It shows seven separate constellations (which it maps out for you in a guide that comes with it)I bought this for my daughter when she was about a year and a half (although I believe it is recommended for ages 3 and up) and she loved it.  I rate it as a four stars simply because it can be really tricky to find the right spot in a room to display it so that you actually get to see all the constellations.  (If you\'re too close to a wall the stars are very small and bunch together.)  Overall it has been a great addition to our nightly bed routine.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I love twilight ladybug!  She is amazing her lights work great, it makes an awesome nightlight.  My daughter is two and she look forward to going to bed now just so she can look at the stars all over her ceiling.  The lights are bright and the stars show up perfectly on the ceiling.  Its the best night light ever.  I wish I had something like this when I was a kid.  I highly recommend this for kids of all ages.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this specifically over the Dream light toy because of the reviews here on Amazon, and I am glad that I did. I let my three year old daughter pick out which animal and color she wanted, then explained to her that this was going to help her sleep in her own bed(which before this turtle was almost non-existant).Once we got it, I explained that it was only for bedtime, and that night I was able to show her how to use it at night, and the different colors. She has been falling asleep in her room regularly now, and I think this turtle has a lot to do with it.It says that you have the option to teach them some of the constellations that lights up, but know if you have lower ceilings you wont be able to notice them. The light is good enough that it will light up the room, and its not harsh where your afraid of it shining too brightly in your child\'s eyes.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I found this on line for $30 and up.  This was the best price, same item, for less than anywhere else.  Arrived a day sooner than expected.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",When I first received the turtle as a shower gift I was a little underwhelmed. Sure it\'s cute and it casts light but I didn\'t quite understand the hefty price tag and the rave reviews. I still don\'t completely understand the inflated price but I do seem to be getting my friend\'s money\'s worth since I use the turtle every night. My daughter is only two months old but we use it for middle of the night feedings every single night. I was having trouble finding a light source that wasn\'t too bright (which was keeping the baby up) but was still bright enough to see what I was doing while I learned how to nurse my daughter. This has fit the bill perfectly. I don\'t imagine this will be the item I use to teach my children about the constellations but it does seem like it will be a good nightlight when my daughter gets older. I know my 9 year-old would steal it to use if he could. As a child I had glow-in-the-dark star stickers all over my bedroom ceiling to achieve this same effect; the turtle seems much more convenient and homeowner friendly.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I got this about a week ago and my 20 month old daughter loves it. We added it to out night routine and she lays down in her crib on her back to stare at the stars. She absolutely loves it. She actually looks forward to bedtime so she can look at the stars. It is also great that it shuts off after 45 minutes. I would definitely recommend this turtle!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My daughter loves the Twilight Turtle.  She is 2.5 years old and loves to fall asleep looking at the ceiling at the blue or green stars the Turtle displays.  We put the turtle on a small table in the center of the room and play a lullaby cd and she fall to sleep in about 10 minutes.  Good Product!,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I sent this for my twin 2 year old granddaughters who do not like to go to bed. I\'ve been told the stars are just wonderful and the girls ooh and ahh at them until they drift off. How nice is that? It is cute too!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We bought this originally for the baby\'s 1st camping trip and we were so amazed on how it lite up the trailer now as he has gotten a little bit older he has learned to turn it on and hold it up to the ceiling and look at the stars, well worth the price",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is the perfect little night light.  The amber is a little dim, but has become our favorite as it is not over-powering and does not distract when our boy is trying to fall asleep.  He loves to turn his turtle on and get ready for bed.  Very cute and well made.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This toy is very nice and batteries were included!The leds can change colors and it does a really good job making the stars really crisp.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My granddaughter is one of those that fights sleep every night.  The lights on this turtle did grab her attention for a while and she enjoyed it. Even though the novelty wore off on HER quickly, hopefully for some other child that doesn\'t fight sleep so much, will enjoy this on a nightly basis.  The product was great though.  Just as expected based on other reviews - the amber color wasn\'t the brightest but the blue and green were great.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I\'ve bought a couple of Cloud B items and they always break too soon.  I\'ve gotten the star turtle twice.  The first time it didnt work out of the box. this second time i went to change the batteries and it didnt work afterwards.  We tried 2 sets of batteries.  My son doesnt play with it, we use it on a table as a night light so its not from wear and tear.  Now i have to get the same one again because he REALLY enjoys it.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This was a gift picked out for my 2-yr old. It\'s bigger but really neat. My only criticism is that the light does not stay on. It shuts off after so long. I\'m sure it is a safety feature, but it would be great to have the option of how long until it shuts off. We still like it, though!",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son will now sleep alone without any complaints. Before this turtle, I had to lay down with him until he fell asleep. The turtle gives off enough light to ease his fear, but not so bright that it would bother anyone else. Money well spent!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","She had/has fun with it, not only at night time, but also when taking it into the dark bathroom during the day and watching the lights on the ceiling and in the mirror.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I purchased this for my son and we love it!  It lights up his room well, and it\'s a perfect night light.  The stars and constellations are clear, and my son loves that you can choose different colors.  I love that it has an automatic shut off timer too.  Very nice Night Light and a great deal on Amazon.  Highly recommend this for any toddlers room.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my 2 yr old grandson as a replacement for one that had belonged to his 5 yr old brother.  He did not want to sleep in his own bed after the older turtle bit the dust, so I was delighted to find it still available.  The stars cast on the ceiling give enough light to keep the boogie man at bay, yet not enough for any other activity (reading, playing), so sleep follows. My older granddaughters (8 & 5) were fighting over their turtle, so I got the ladybug too.  One for each, right?  Now they argue over who gets which.  I highly recommend these for any child that is hesitant at sleeping alone at night - worth every penny.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My kids love this thing (girl 7, boy 5)... so much that I bought it for the little one (6mos) helps with late night feedings.... better that turning on the bright light and wake her up. This way the gentle light allows us to see... and she can lull herself back to sleep.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I purchased this for my son who is 11 months old. He loves it!! He actually looks forward to bedtime now and shreiks with delight when I turn on the turtle. He lays on his back and gazes atthe stars.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the third color-amber- does not project well. Otherwise a delight!!,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old. He absolutely loves it and it does light up his whole bedroom ceiling. My only complaint is that when it arrived from Amazon the batteries were dead. If it would have come from a store shelf I would understand but thought it was strange coming from a warehouse. Also within a month the batteries were dead again. He does turn it on a lot but I don\'t think it is on enough to die that quickly.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I purchased this item after seeing one at my niece\'s home. I thought it would help my 6 and 3 yo kids to sleep on their own instead of a nightlight. I got one in blue and purple. I have to say once I received it, I was a bit disappointed since it was much smaller than the one my niece had. I figured this was the &#34;baby&#34; version. I was pleasantly surprised that it lit up their entire ceilings quite well! Even in my daughter\'s room that has 13+ ceilings!! I would highly recommend this product. It changes colors and shuts off on its own as an option. My kids love it and it has made bedtime easier. Love it!!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I couldn\'t be happier about this purchase. I was squeemish about paying twenty-something dollars for a nightlight, but it ended up being well worth it. My 13-month-old and I sleep in the same room, so I wanted a soothing, not-too-bright nightlight to accomidate the both of us. This turned out perfect. It casts a sky of stars across the ceiling and even patly down the walls. The green and blue are gorgeous, and the amber is very soothing and muted for  sleeping. We both love the atmosphere it creates. The product is well made; it even has a built-in timer to turn it off after you fall asleep. And the timer lasts long enough that you\'re not reaching over to turn the light back on before you fall asleep. Wonderful product.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this ladybug for my daughter who is almost 3 and she loves it.  My 4 month old son has the turtle one which is great too!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my 12 month old. However, my older boys (ages 9yrs and 3 yrs) ended up ""borrowing"" it! Needless to say, I\'ll be buying another one soon!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We first bought this turtle four our 1-year-old son as a gift, and he loved it immediately!  The stars show beautifully and cover most of the ceiling without being so bright it interferes with sleeping.  It is extremely soothing and creates a haven-like feel in the room.  I wish I\'d had one of these when I was a kid, I would have slept a lot better!  Five years and two more kids later, I can say that all three of my children adore Twilight Turtle and he is an essential nighttime companion.  After five years with three small kiddos, he has taken a lot of unintentional abuse and held up very well considering.  I will be getting one for each of our kiddos now.  I cannot recommend this product enough!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We received this turtle night light as a gift for my one year old a couple of days ago.  And the first time we turned it on my whole family just stood in the nursery amazed at how the room immediately was covered in stars!  Not just the ceiling, the entire room is covered in stars, we placed the turtle on the floor in the middle of the bedroom and every where you looked there were constellations.  Even my five year old is enamored with it, my husband and I both commented on how easy it was to change the batteries (although it comes with 3 AAA\'s to begin with) and the lights on the inside are LED so the shell doesn\'t ever get hot.  It has a timer to auto shut off after 45 minutes, so there is no need to sneak back in and turn it off after an hour.  We would definitely recommend this to all our friends with children.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I got this for my nieces room and the colors worked out right, she\'s too small to see it but it looks great and her parents loved it. I would recommend this to a friend.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I brought this turtle into our 4 and 5 year old\'s shared bedroom last night and it was an instant hit. The amber/red stars do not show up as well as the green/blue on our blue walls, but the different color options were still appreciated. The boys were excited to count the stars while they went to sleep last night, and push the buttons and pet their new turtle friend ""lighty.""Although we still kept the night light on, I think this will be a great help to the younger of the two who is forever awake longer than the older. I highly recommend this item.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for my 2 year old and 6 year old daughters.  It has been a huge hit for both of them but especially my 6 year old who has recently become scared of the dark.  She is able to turn it back on in the middle of the night and I like that it turns off in 45 minutes after she has fallen back asleep.  Would highly recommend this to anyone!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This was much cheaper online than in the store and I thought it was silly to even get due to how many night lights my daughter already had.  This turned out to be different, it is easy to move from room to room and in a dark room it will beam stars and a moon onto the ceiling and walls in three different colors.  There is something relaxing about this effect and I find myself turning it on at night and looking at the stars.  My daughter loves it as well, and it automatically shuts off after about an hour, batteries have lasted almost 3 months at this point so it does not eat through batteries quickly at all.  Solid product for sure.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Great gift idea for anyone! I can\'t wait for my little guy to try it out Christmas night. We tried it out and there are stars EVERYWHERE.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for my granddaughter\'s 1st birthday.  She goes to sleep with it and wakes up with it.  She likes to push the buttons to change the colors of her stars.  Would highly recommend to others.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","While this would be a lot of money to pay for a night light ordinarily, it is a bargain for what amounts to a nighttime friend that helps reduce the scariness of the dark.  My wife and I originally got this for our daughter, but find that we use it as much if not more.What it is:This is a plush turtle with a sleepy face that has a hard plastic shell.  The shell has holes in it that allows a light to shine through.  On the back of the shell are buttons that activate a light on the inside of the shell; the shell itself is translucent and glows different colors depending on the setting - green, blue, or orange.  The light also comes through the star-shaped holes (and one moon-shaped hole) to shine on the surrounding walls and ceiling.  The effect is something like being in a planetarium and is very mellow and soothing.  My daughter really likes it, but my wife and I positively love it.  One can either turn off the light manually, or leave them to turn off automatically after 45 minutes.  presumably after your little one is fast asleep)What it is for:This is a great little companion to soothe children to sleep if they are a little afraid of the dark or if they need a companion (the turtle) to be near as they go to sleep.  It works as a night light while it is on, but it won\'t serve that purpose after the light goes off.  From my perspective, this little guy also works great for romantic or soothing lighting in the bedroom, out on the patio, or wherever... for the parents.  Yes, my wife and I are constantly \'borrowing\' our daughter\'s sleep light because.... well, because it\'s just so cool.This does not plug in to the wall, which I like, actually, for safety reasons when leaving it alone in my daughter\'s room.  It is one of the few items we have that I actually don\'t mind getting batteries for.  In any case, it lasts a long time using quality AAA batteries - over a month of nightly use in our case.  It is about 12"" long by 8"" wide by 4"" tall.  approximate measurements  These also come in sea turtle and ladybug variants.  One additional cool thing is that the stars are actually patterned as constellations, which project on the ceiling... yes, just like in a planetarium.  The device comes with a paper guide explaining which ones they are so you can identify them.  Serious astronomy geeks make note:  I don\'t think what projects is an exact scale replica of the night sky, but it is close enough in my view to use as an instructional guide for tiny astronomers-to-be.Though we got this fairly late in the getting-the-kid-to-sleep gambit, I would have had this right from the start had I known about it.  Is it essential?  Maybe not, but it is cool enough and useful enough that I wouldn\'t do without it.  Enthusiastically recommended!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I love this lady bug. My 4 month old will coo & babble away laying in her crib looking up at the stars. She falls asleep pretty quick w/ it. I love that it automatically shuts off & doesn\'t heat up. Definately worth it!!!!!!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son is more than 3 now, and he still loves it. In fact we all do! Our version came with 3 different colored lights, the LEDs are still good, I\'ve had to change the batteries numerous times, but it\'s used every night until the timer turns it off. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, even with infants because it allowed me to see my son in his room without waking him up with harsh lights.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This turtle is my secret weapon for baby showers... every mother I have gifted it to says it\'s a life saver. Haven\'t seen it in action yet but I will take a mom\'s word for it - it\'s awesome!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I received this as a birthday gift. My son LOVES IT! It gives just enough light where the whole room is not bright. I wish we would have had one sooner.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We used this every night in my older daughter\'s room when she was 2. She loved changing the colors and looking for the moon. We now use this in my younger daughter\'s room (age 22 months), and she loves it just as much. I\'ve bought this for 5 other friends as bday and baby shower gifts because I know their kids will love them (confirmed by them!). It\'s a great gift for both girls and boys - young and old.  It\'s a great nightlight, and I love that it automatically turns off after about 20 minutes. We haven\'t had to change the batteries for months for this reason.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I have had one of these for 7 years, since my first son was born, and my boys love it,  as do I. Very soothing at night to lie there and watch the stars as you go to sleep. There are many copies, but this one is by far the best. No music, just lights. I would get annoyed with the same music everynight anyway, like the knockoffs have.I buy this as a baby shower, or baby gift for everyone i know that is having a baby, and they all rave about it!Best invention ever;) LOVE, LOVE LOVE this product!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 2 year old son loves this. He likes the stars and the moon. It shines a lot brighter than expected, but needs the batteries replaced often or it dims pretty quickly. Would buy again.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I like this for what it is, a good night light and something fun for babies and children to look at when they go to sleep. It is good quality and the stars shine bright and clear on my daughter\'s ceiling. You have to be careful when buying this, there are a lot of imitations out there and from the reviews I read, they are a rip off. But, also, I purchased the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle; which I thought played music. There was nothing misleading about the description, I just think that I got confused after looking at multiple versions of this. But, for the $30 price tag, I expected a little more. The turtle is cute and works well, just seems over priced.I would give it 5 stars if it were priced a little better.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I love the Twilight Turtle. It was maybe more money than I wanted to spend, BUT my baby was completely transfixed and soothed by it--which is worth every penny. I want one of these for myself now.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My wife and I purchased the Lady Bug version for our two-year-old niece as both a decorative item for her bedroom and as a night light. We and our niece\'s parents couldn\'t be any happier with it and, most importantly, the young girl absolutely adores it!The product is very well made and is soft enough for an older child to cuddle with. The three selectable colors is a nice feature, while the auto off timer is perfect for preserving battery life. Unfortunately, because it is only battery powered (no AC adpater), you will be recharging/repurchasing batteries on a regular basis.The light output is bright enough so as to be seen within a room; but, not so bright that it will keep a child from falling sound asleep. The star pattern is neat and scatters about the walls and ceiling very well.I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to replace the traditional night light with something a bit more unique and that fits either gender.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This was ordered for my almost-two Grandson.  He is delighted with the ceiling stars and falls asleep with it every night.  Great product and awesome service.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I saw this turtle while finding a suitable gift for my niece who was turning 4 this year. I read the description and ordered it. She was so excited to see it. She kept asking me where I buy gifts from coz she loved it so much. She wasnt ready to share it with anyone. Now, she uses it every night.The smile on her face....Its worth all that I paid. Its a perfect gift for kids.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought two of these for shower gifts, and the moms rave about how cool these are for their little ones.  The ambience is very soft and soothing.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",The stars and moon are bright and easy to look at for the baby.  The only con is that they are stationary so the baby gets bored of the lights after a little while.,4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My granddaughter was given this item for her 7th birthday and she absolutely loved it, no negatives whatsoever.  It is suggested for babies, but we think it is much better for a young child who might understand what is being projected onto the ceiling.  We discovered that her new neighbor, also age 7, has the same turtle and also loves it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Love this I just wish my sons room was a litter darker so he could see the stars better but he wont let me close the door at night so Thats ok some times we close the door and stare at the stars before I put him to bed,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Wow, so many things I want to say about this product.First off, I have always dreamed about sleeping outdoors, but being afraid of coyotes, bugs, and rapists, I figured that is not the best choice. So, in an attempt to make my dream come true, I ordered this turtle. And may I say that it defied all of my expectations. As the stars and the moons fill my room, I literally feel like I am sleeping outside. When I pair it with my ocean sounds cd, I am reminded of the days when I would drunkenly fall asleep during beach parties, only to be woken up by the arriving officers after the bon fire has already died out.Not only that, but I get the option of three colors- blue, green, and amber. I go with the green most of the time. The other two are also quite beautiful. It also makes a great nightlight and the plus is that it automatically turns off after 30 minutes, saving the battery. Essential if you have not taken the time to invest in the rechargeable ones.It actually took me a while to choose between the turtle and the ladybug. I decided to go with the turtle to represent Maryland\'s terrapins, so when my dorm mates ask me why the hell do I have a stuffed toy, I tell them it\'s all in school spirit.I took away a star because apparently it is an attractive dog chew toy.  The first day my puppy tried to chew on it. To be fair, he is an overly aggressive chewer, and has eaten pretty much every object he comes upon. Unless it\'s a balloon or a ball, then gets scared shitless...literally. Luckily I caught him in the act, so no real damage was done. But it was a close call.All in all, I can honestly say this turtle has completed my life.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I purchased several of these for the grandchildren, and liked them so much; I ordered one for myself.  It puts stars all over the ceiling, and the walls.  The power went out the other night, and it was great having the light of the stars.  A great gift for kids of all ages.  I love mine.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My little one can\'t sleep without it; it doesn\'t seem like much as nothing moves, but the calming lights really do something for the little ones. Everything is secure (can\'t get to the batteries without a screwdriver) and it never gets hot! Sure you might get some star indents if your little one sleeps on it...but that\'s okay.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This plushie turtle/nightlight/star projector is fantastic. He shines in blue, green, or amber (choose colors with the push of a button) and projects an array of stars around the room. The room needs to be fairly dark to see the stars in amber, but green or blue settings work well even with another nightlight in the room. The shell is hard plastic so do not let a child stand or step on it, but the plush turtle is still cuddly. If you\'re looking for an astronomically correct star projector this isn\'t one, but it gives baby or parents (my wife and I may get a second one for our room)a starry, fascinating ceiling. He shuts off after a set time so you do not need to worry about coming back to shut him off after baby falls asleep. Batteries were included.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is pretty cool. I thought it would have music, because we received it as a gift, but it does not. Which turns out to be totally fine. It displays stars on the ceiling and lights up different images, if you choose. It\'s pretty neat and my baby seems to really like it and likes pushing the buttons. It\'s pretty bright so it\'s definitely a good night light to fall to sleep to.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this as a gift to my friend, she loved it very much! You can switch between the colors",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my 9 month old granddaughter who doesn\'t like to fall asleep right away, she loves laying there talking to the stars until she falls asleep. We love it!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This item is adoreable, hand-painted, and very unique. I gave it as a birthday gift for my friend\'s one-year-old. They seemed to enjoy the gift and I have heard rave reviews from other friends with children who have used it. Also, I\'ve heard that even somewhat older kids enjoy having it on to sleep at night. So it would be a nice gift even for a 4 or 5 year-old child.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","First, it is not a Planetarium, it\'s a toy. Don\'t expect to give astronomy lessons to your kid with anything that project stars on a ceiling and costs less than a thousand dollars.Having sait that, it\'s a lovely product, my 5 month old loves it, he gets mesmerized by the stars and moon, especially when projected on the wall close to him. The amber light is a little dim, but blue and green work very well in a dark room.We are very satisfied with our Turtle. It was an instant hit and it is now fully incorporated in our sleeping routine.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We love the ease of use and the fact that you can look for constellations in the \'night sky\' while you drift off to sleep. The turtle is well made and had a soft plush feel that even adults appreciate! A great gift for young and old!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I got this for my daughter when we were having a new baby since they\'d be sharing a room and my daughter always kept a light on. This was one of the best kids\' purchases I\'ve made in a while. We\'ve had it for almost 2 years now and have only had to change the batteries 3 times and that\'s with daily use.  The stars and moon are bright and the different color options ensure you can find a color that will be bright in any room. Our fave is purple. My daughter usually has to press it once more before falling asleep. It does not play music. The stars don\'t move. Where are you people getting your info? It\'s not supposed to. It is the best nightlight ever. It keeps my daughter\'s attention at bedtime and soothes her. The baby, now a toddler, fell in love with it, so here I am buying our second. My daughter\'s friend has the turtle at home and since she saw our ladybug has been bugging her mom for one. This is a sure winner with ages baby - 10.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is an awesome product.  My son had been having a bit of trouble feeling secure once Mommy & Daddy left the room, so we got one of these.  He just adores it.  He loves having three color choices, and frankly, I do, too!  When he goes to bed, it\'s not quite dark yet, so he uses blue or green (they show up more easily).  When I go in before I go to sleep, I put it on the yellow setting so that if he opens his eyes after I leave he doesn\'t get nervous, thanks to the soft yellow star light.  Another awesome feature is that it stays on for 45 minutes, unlike most other products similar to this.  Excellent product, well worth the money, and of course, another timely delivery!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Bought this for my girlfriend (20+) for Christmas and she loved it. The turtle is very plush and projects star shapes (and some constellations) on the ceiling.No, the stars don\'t move, but if they did that would probably require some irritating mechanical sound which would keep up whoever is using this nightlight. Seemed to display stars in all colors well enough (blue seems to be the best) in a normal 8\' height ceiling. Not sure how good it serves as a nightlight as I haven\'t used it myself.Ideally you want to place something like this in the middle of the room ABOVE bed-level so that the stars are displayed clearly and unobstructed. Too low and they will appear blurry and dim, too high and it won\'t give you the starry night sky effect. Be warned about the battery cover though; it\'s made of a fairly soft plastic so don\'t gouge at it with a screwdriver. Even the shell seems fairly delicate so I wouldn\'t recommend kids throwing this around.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I originally bought one of these, the turtle, for my grandson. Then his twin sisters liked it so mom put it in their room which left my grandson without. I bought another but the girls began fighting over who would have that one! I bought yet another and now everyone has one!! They love them and offers a little comfort in a dark room!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My kiddos loved these. I had three of them (one for each kid). They all loved finding the moon and picking colors.Anyhow.. My original review (in March) was glowing. As all three have died.. I\'m not pleased with this product.The first two, my kids threw around a bit. So avoid having this happen with the third, I put it on the dresser. It lasted a little under three months.All of them were the same when they died. The lights just started blinking. My first thought was .. Oh, it needs new batteries! So I change the batteries and it appears to work. Until I go in to check on my kids and the thing is blinking again.I would not recommend this if you plan to use it nightly. And it does not make for a nice toy once it has died. The shell is not soft.",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My daughter had just switched over from her crib to her toddler bed 6 months ago and she was having troubles staying in bed and in her room at nap time and bed time.  She was so excited about this night light that her friend had that I decided to get her one right away and she now wants to go to bed and falls asleep under the stars every night.  With the auto shut off we do not have to worry about going into her room and waking her up!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I like it, cause it has 3 nice colors when lit - blue, green and amber. The amber is a bit dim, but its OK. My boy falls asleep better when this color is on. I also like the automatic shut off function. I\'d prefer to have a cord to it (it only operates on battery\'s) but otherwise is a good product.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","It\'s a few months that we ordered it for our daughter. She is nine months old and she loved it from day one. She loves watching the lady night at her sleep time and trying to grab the stars at wall.The star color choices are blue, green and red.its so much to have for babies and even for the parents.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Given as a shower gift 6 years ago my older son didn\'t have much interest in the light up part- more just playing with it as a turtle. For awhile he would use it as a step stool and I would cringe worrying the plastic would crack and that would be the end of it. when they were babies it was definately a toy mom was more into that they were. Also the Weimaraner puppy had got it more than once and never chewed damaged to the hard plastic shell. That alone earns 5 stars IMHO.When  little brother came a long and the older oneff with it too.,5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue",This is a really cute bib.  Bought it as a gift for someone and hope they like it.  Seems strong.,4
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","Soft, absorbent, Fun....these lovely bibs have taken my Grand-Nephew through the cutting of his first four teeth and the bibs look like new.  A very good investment.",5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","I first purchased the Creative Genius one and then just went back to order the train since we were so happy with the purchase.  It seemed rather large at first for our 4 month old, but it definitely still works for her.  It was easy to wash and dry when some other bibs sometimes take longer to dry. I just wish they had some slightly better designs -- but from a functionality perspective it\'s great.",5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","I bought this bib when my son was 4 months old and teething. Best bib by far! The bib is very absorbent, very good quality and it fit him perfectly!",5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","Our 6 month old was 10.4 and 22 inches when he was born, then doubled his weight and added another 5 inches in his first 2 months. So he\'s a big boy! And he started teething at 4 months, so it\'s been really hard to find bibs big enough for him that are also appropriate for his developmental level. He doesn\'t need the plastic ones with the pocket food catchers, he just needs really big, absorbent, waterproof ones. And these bibs are AWESOME. Totally worth the price. They are nice and thick, and have a huge neck hole. I love them. He\'s only recently figured out that the rubber on the corners is for him to chew on, so not much to say about that, but I\'ve really appreciated the size and absorbancy. Just to be fair, they WILL soak through if left on for too long. I\'ve literally ordered about 10 of them, and we rotate through around 4 a day to let some dry out.....",5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue",I bought this for my grandson\'s first birthday and my daughter loves it because it is bigger than most bibs and is very cute.  My grandson does chew on the corner teether occasionally too.,5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","This bib is colorful, thick and I loved the idea of the teething corner on it. A little pricey for a bib but should get a lot of use out of it.",5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue",Every baby should have one of these bibs. My little man loves to chew on everything... so the hard corner on this bib keeps him very busy.,5
Stroller Rain Cover,"great deal, great price. Fit my stroller perfectly, I have used it many times since then. Arrived very quickly, happy with purchase.",5
"Deck Shield Netting, Clear, 30 Feet x 35 Inches","I would not recommend this product for outdoor use.  I am writing this review approximately ten months after installing this product on my deck and it is completely disintegrating.  I actually took it down this evening because I was tired of cleaning chunks of it out of my yard.For the cost and time it takes to install, I would definitely consider other alternatives.  The reason I installed this product is b/c there is a large gap at the bottom of my railing that we were concerned our son could fit through.  I will now be installing new balusters -- yes, at a higher cost, but I could have put the $100+ I wasted on this product toward the new lumber.",1
Baby\'s First Year Keepsake Stamp Pad Calendar in Blue,"this calendar is perfect.  you make it your own, i\'ve completed it for two of my children and LOVE looking back on the first year.  i tracked everything in this! first foods, first visitor, first sickness. the stickers are great and the ink pad is such a great idea.  ive given this two times as a gift as well and each person adored it.  as a new mom you dont have much time to ""record"" things, this gives you a one stop place to write it all down.  i even attached thier christening invites, favors, birthday invites and favors, birth announcements all in the front cover.",5
Baby\'s First Year Keepsake Stamp Pad Calendar in Blue,"This is a great keepsake for baby\'s first year. I have to admit I got lazy and didn\'t do it religiously for either of my boys, but I do like to look back and see the milestones on the calendar!  I never really used the ink pad...and it dried out after a while, but other than that, it\'s great!",4
"Cardinal Gates Edge Cushion, Ivory","We use this cushion almost everywhere in our house for kids\' proof. Most of our furniture are black, so black edge cushion is a perfect match. It blends it very well with our furniture (dinning table, entertainment cabinet, bed frame, etc). It also comes with strong double side tapes.",5
"Cardinal Gates Edge Cushion, Ivory","I baby-proofed every sharp edge in my living room with this tape, and it does the job. It\'s a bit difficult to apply, and the adhesive is not super-strong, which is good if you don\'t want to permanently baby-proof your furniture, but bad if your baby decides it\'s a fun toy, because they can pull it right off. Also hard to put around corners, but I got around it by cutting a slit where it went around the edge.",3

SnuggleWool Infant Car Seat Cover- Universal Size,"I just received this in the mail and like the first reviewer am highly disappointed.  The wool is very abrasive.  Also the backing is polyester.  I viewed this product from a couple of different websites before purchasing it and not once did I read that the back was polyester.  I was informed that I did not look close enough as I found that was true.  Though, I did find myself annoyed that it was not stated in the description.  Unfortunately it seems to be one of the only wool car seat covers on the market.  I am trying to return it now.  I\'ll try to update this to let you know how that goes.  I am finding that my attempt to be satisfied with the product by washing it according to their directions will ultimately mean I used it and therefore will not be able to return it.  We\'ll see.  As an update to returning it: I was pleasantly surprised by the seller, Serendipity Shopper, on how well they handled my disappointment and truly bent over backwards to make sure I was satisfied.  Ultimately, they took the product back.  Thanks",1
BROWN 24 Inch Length Extension for Metal Hearth Pad,"With a Christmas visit from a new toddler grandson coming up, I wanted a way to protect him from falls into our large raised stone hearth.  The measurements for this product were too small for the length of our hearth, so I ordered the extension kit.  The pad worked fine as far as being protective, but I was unable to figure out how to put it together with the extension.  I am fairly mechanically-minded for a girl, but this was beyond me.  So I had to call in the troops (my husband), and it even took him a little while to figure out how to make the thing fit together properly so that it would cling to the hearth properly.  Actually, he ended up going down in the basement and getting some kind of extra piece of metal to sturdy it up so it would stay together.  However, once it was finally mounted, it stayed on like a charm, and we were very glad it was there, as our toddler fell into it more than once, saving a nasty bump on the head, I am sure. As long as you are ""handy"", I would say you would be happy with this product overall.",4
"Cardinal Gates Corner Cushion, Brown",They are great.  When my grandson comes over I don\'t worry about him falling and hurting himself on the table corners.,5
"Cardinal Gates Corner Cushion, Brown","First the positive -- the brown cushions fit our coffee table perfectly, will definitely protect our lil one from injury, also they are aesthetically pleasing.However, the tape is completely horrible and considering you need the cushions to stay on --this is a significant issue. Both my husband and I messed with the tape for nearly an hour before we were able to get it to stick, and even now, I am fairly certain that my daughter will be able to rip these off.",2
"SnuggleWool Lambs Wool Pad, Crib 28x52","My granddaughter (7 months) and her Mom share a room in the finished basement. Our winter here in Chicago has been extremely cold and I was looking for way to keep the cold off the crib mattress without haveing a corded device in the crib (that thought just scared me too much). Well, this totally did it. My granddaughter loves it, from the first night we put this on the mattress she started sleeping through the night again.",5
"SnuggleWool Lambs Wool Pad, Crib 28x52","I thought it was going to look/feel more natural. At first I thought it was all synthetic, but I guess it\'s natural. I don\'t think is the greatest thing on earth. There are many other ways to make your baby comfy, with natural fibers and not spend this money.Anyway it was a gift for me, but myself I wouldn\'t spend the money in this item.",3
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"We have very long windows that are low to the floor in every room in our two-story house. We\'ve been on the hunt for a good window safety product for a long time. Anything else wouldn\'t work because of our window coverings - wood blinds and roman shades. This one is perfect. It\'s adjustable and I hardly notice it, but I have pushed and pushed on that window to try to shove the guards out of place and I couldn\'t make them move a bit. We will be ordering more for sure!",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,These do just what I wanted-keep my second story double hung windows from opening more than 4 inches.  Easy to install.  I have not had any problems with them.,4
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,This little device successfully stopped my 5 year old and 3 year old from opening up the windows.  We have white window so the device sort of blends in and they can\'t move the window.  I love that it comes off fast in-case of an emergency and if the window is forced by an adult hand it would pop off.  Perfect item for someone who doesn\'t want to drill into their windows.  I highly recommend.,5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"Our new house has front bedroom windows that come nearly to the floor. The grandkids were scared when we left them open, anyone or anything could get in easily (we live where there are critters.)  These wedges work nicely to keep the window from opening more than we want, and they pull off for an emergency if we needed to exit by window.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I think this is a great invention.  Our house was built in 2006 and the windows are very good quality windows, but for some reason they don\'t have those little pop out locks that allow you to open the window a few inches.  In my last house we had these pop out locks and they were great.  The only complaint I had was that they were not adjustable as they were built in to the window and they only allowed you to open the window about 2 inches.  I had been looking for something similar so that we would be able to leave our windows open a few inches during the day and night to get some fresh air.  We watch a lot of crime shows and my mind is always racing thinking about how easy it would be for someone to break in when our windows are open by cutting the screen, and we wouldn\'t hear a thing.  Therefore, we never really open our windows.  Then I found these.  I ordered 2 packs (4 locks total) and they work great!  They are adjustable, so you can open the windows as far as you want.  I have mine set at about 4-5 inches because I cannot imagine anyone being able to fit through that amount of space.  They are easy to remove as well.  You simply pull the wedge off the velcro and voila!  This is great because on those nice breezy days we can still open our windows all the way, and then close them to a few inches at night.  I am not concerned about the velcro losing its stickiness because I figure I will just buy more velcro and stick on the window.  Not a big deal to me.  This gives me peace of mind and I think its really a great idea.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I\'ve used this for a few months now.I like it, it works. Set up took a minute.Put one on each side of the panel and that should make itvery difficult someone from the outside to pull the window.Con:It can\'t be moved so be sure you measure how high you want the windowto go up on a regular basis.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,this is a good product for some. in some of my windows the lower pane just slide over the wedge ans couldn\'t really hod it tight in place. whether it is a problem of the width of my windows or the product I am not sure. but works on some.,4
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"Every summer I put air conditioners in my windows, and every summer the upper window slips down, letting the air out and the bugs in.

(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"This product was the answer to my need to ensure the safety of my impulsive four year old daughter with our second floor windows.  We have wood windows from 1989, and I didn\'t want to be making holes with screws.  The window wedge doesn\'t require any screws, installs in under 1 minute, and definitely ensures the window won\'t open.  With our windows, we found that only one was necessary per window, and the windows aren\'t opening.  I don\'t believe my kids will even attempt to disengage the lock - other reviews mentioned that kids easily moved the wedge and opened the windows.  I also didn\'t let them see me install the velcro or the wedges.  Thank you for a great product!  Now I\'m ordering more for the rest of our second story windows!!!",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,Works really well. We used these in a window after putting in an air conditioner unit and the window doesn\'t budge.,5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I bought a few of these on the advice of a friend and I am glad I did!  I live on the ground floor with windows that open wide.  After one break-in into my apartment I was scared to leave the windows open, even when I\'m home.  I was scared for my life!  My landlord stipulated that I can\'t make modifications to the apartment, so bars were out of the question.  A friend of mine told me about these wedges and I got them.Today I left the bathroom window open (with the wedges in place set at 4 inches) while I went shopping.  I came home and tried to close the bathroom window, but it was tight against the wedge.  This means that there was another attempted break-in!  The wedges worked!",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"From a purely cosmetic perspective, if you have white window sashes, the wedge really blends in well.  However, once you apply the velcro adhesive to the frame, you should figure it will be there for good, since I tried to peel one off, and the paint came with it.From a functional perspective, it seems to work well, so I hope that my kid doesn\'t outsmart it while I am not looking for 5 seconds....",4
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"If your child is tall enough to reach them, it doesn\'t take much force to pry them from the Velcro, and totally defeat the system.  However, I got around this by tilting the lower window (of a double-hung) in, and applying the wedge to the outside.  Since I don\'t think our child knows how to tilt in the window, nor is strong enough to pull the catches, this solution should work.  You just need to be careful.  Defiantly not a useful option for any child over 5 or 6.  You\'d probably need something requiring a key at that point.  (and of course, you\'d need a key accessible in the event of an emergency)",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,The window wedge is great for not only security but for baby proofing. With the edge in place you can not get the window open.,5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,My son at 3 years old was able to climb on the window sill and unlock the window and pull the two wedges off their Velcro strips and then climb down and open the window.  This happened in a matter of less than 5 minutes of him in his room supposedly having quiet time.  They would work better for windows that only slide open side to side.  Ours are vertical so the wedge was much more accessible.,1
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"My friend has these and her 3 year old opened the window anyways and fell out of the second story window.  She\'s ok, but this product and those like it can not be trusted for safety!",1
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,Bought these for my kids\' windows on the 2nd story... they work well enough and get the job done but they were not as sturdy as I thought they would be.  Keeping them because they do keep my kids from opening the window to far.  The Velcro just doesn\'t stick as well as I thought it should have.,4

(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"These did not work for us.  I wish they did.  The tape sticks to the window frame just fine, but the piece that is supposed to stop the window just slides along the velcro when the window is pushed against it!  It seemed to work when I first applied it, but after the first test, it just kept falling off the velcro tape. Now I have to return them an figure out another way to keep my kids from falling out the windows.",1
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,works very good and easy to install. anyone can do it. it protects anything from the outside in. i recommend,5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I\'m writing this about 30 minutes after seeing my 4 year old in his 2nd story room with his window wide open, and the two plastic window wedges we had installed in his hands.  We had the wedges installed on our fairly new vinyl windows, as well as having them locked with the two sliding lock mechanisms attached to the window.  When I asked my son how exactly he managed to open his window, he simply told me he had climbed onto the window sill (the window sill in his room is about 18"" from the ground), unlocked the sliding locks, and pulled off the ""plastic thingys"" (referring to the window wedges).  We\'ve had these installed since he was about 18 months, and up until then he hasn\'t even noticed them.  But once your child gets curious enough to put any effort into opening his/her window, the window wedges don\'t provide much of a challenge if they\'re at all determined.  They pull off of the velcro easily, and were visible enough for my son to figure out why the window wouldn\'t open all the way when he tried.  Luckily, I was able to catch this before anything bad happened, but I am on google now looking for an alternative, and will nail the window shut if I have too.Basically, they\'re good in theory, and for younger kids who just need a mild deterrent from opening a window, they should work fine.  But for an older child who likes to figure out the mechanics behind why they aren\'t able to do something, these window wedges are easily figured out.",1
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"The means of attaching to a window was pretty straight forward, it\'s a velcro strip that\'s parallel to the line of the window/door opening and closing.  The velcro connection is pretty weak between the wedge and the window, but is good enough to slow opening of the window.In my case, it\'s more used as a deterrant rather than a full on locking of the window.  So I\'d use it more as a case of being on the back door which would give me enough time to stop my son from opening the slider door in a quick manner.  He\'ll eventually being able to force it open, but will at least give enough time to keep the dog from running away.It does the job for my purposes, but if someone is going to use it to keep the window from ever opening you might want to invest in a means of protecting the window locks or something that drills into the window.",4

SnuggleWool Baby Blanket 27x36In. Cotton Flannel Bk,"I am not sure what to think. Since I was only able to see this ONE that I actually purchased in person, I don\'t know if it is normal or not for the wool to be so - kind of coarse and not so snuggly. I had this impression that it would be soft, fluffy, comfy, snuggly - but it\'s rather stiff and coarse. I\'ve tried to wash it (correctly I am sure), I\'ve been gentle with it - but it\'s been this way since out of the bag. Perhaps mine is defective or I did something wrong - I have no idea or anything else to compare it to.Baby seems to sleep better now that I\'ve taken it OUT of the crib as well - so this didn\'t work for us - plus it\'s pretty expensive. Wanted to love it - but didn\'t.",3
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","The colors may not be to everyone\'s palate if you want a play pen that would match your home decor as it is garish; but if you don\'t care about color schemes, I would definitely recommend this product. It is a great product, very sturdy, is light and folds easily. It\'s worth every cent I paid for it. My six month old sons rolls around in it, and I feel very confident leaving him there to play while I attend to my daily chores.",5
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray",Worth the price and quite spacious. I can take it with me wherever I go and baby is not excluded because he can see through the mesh  sides.  Really happy with this purchase.,5
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","I would have given this item 4 or 5 stars for how easy it was to put up and take down and the pattern, but it had such a strong chemical odor that I had to return it.  There is no way I would put my baby in there to sleep to inhale whatever chemicals were causing that odor - it smelled like strong adhesive.  Very disappointed.",2
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray",We were a little skeptical about some of the reviews but we ordered this anyway and were very happy! It is easy to open and close...just email the company and they give you a link on utube which shows how to open and close. It is a SNAP!!!,5
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","This play yard is perfect!  If you read the instructions, which are clearly printed on the inside of the play yard, it\'s very easy to set up and take down.  It\'s sturdy, and stores away quickly and easily.  I love it, and my grandson is comfortable in it!  I made my own crib sheet for it, so I have no idea what sheets would fit it.

"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","I have the gray/red model and like it. Glad I didn\'t opt for the bright colored option to save a few bucks. This Is perfect for what I need: a play pen and/or portable bed when we travel. It is hard to snap/unsnap if you don\'t do it right. (short version: when unfolding it, push floor down last. When putting it away, pull floor up first.). All in all, this is tons better than getting a fancy play yard that costs twice as much...you\'ll likely never use the extra stuff on the expensive ones...",5
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","I\'ll start off my saying we only used this play yard for 10 days on vacation.  The price was so good we ordered it to be a disposable sleep solution instead of having to deal with flying with our own.  It was very easy to install and it is quite roomy so it met our needs.  The cons were I was uncomfortable with the mattress being an inch shorter than the play yard, it seems like a big health risk, especially for a smaller child.  And I also felt like the mattress was kind of lumpy and very hard.  I ended up wrapping it in a towel beneath the sheet so it wouldn\'t crackle every time my little one rolled over. Also, and this is a matter of personal taste, I found it very gaudy, like having the circus in the house.  They are all very bold, very different colors, so this is not a play yard I would choose as a permanent fixture in our home.",3
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","after she managed to break her old playpen &#34;helping nana put it in the other room&#34;, the Dream on me full size play yard was the choice.

"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","Just bought this play yard and I am delighted with it! It is larger and taller than most, which is great for a toddler. The bright primary colors match my playroom decor but there are several others to choose from. I work in childcare in my home and I am constantly replacing play yards, this one is as sturdy and well built as many I have paid a much higher price for. Most play yards now come with so many extra pieces to them that I do not need (bassinet, hood, skirting etc), and don\'t want to pay for! I will be buying more and would highly recommend!",5

"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","The pay yard itself seems quite well made.  I would have rated it a 5 except for the directions--especially about how to take it back down.  It took me a long time to figure out that, at the middle of each top bar, there are two hidden latches (one on each side of the hinge) that must be squeezed up from the bottom of the cross bar in order to unlock the hinge.  The directions to &#34;lift up&#34; and &#34;push in&#34; do not describe the unlocking action very well in my estimation.  Other than that, highly recommended.",4

I, along with many others, still haven\'t been able to set it up. The sides have a secret locking system that is impossible to get to work. I even got angry and cut one open to see what makes it work. We still can\'t get it to lock in place. I purchased this for my papillon puppies to play in, and they\'re still in cardboard boxes. I\'m sure they\'ll have new homes before we ever get this horrible thing to work.",1
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","Bought this for my 8 month old grandson. He likes to play in it because it is roomy. I gave it this rating because the priceis right and is it well made, good size, and taller than others I saw reviewed. So he can use it longer.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","I guess it depends on how it fits with your door like some other reviews mentioned, but for me it fit like a glove and seems very secure. I\'m very pleased.",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",The metal screws are of low quality (soft metal) and also painted (which does not help with installation - screwdriver is slipping on the paint). The instructions are wrong - the drill bit sizes recommended for drilling holes in the door frame are clearly smaller than they should be.,2
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","I was a bit reluctant to purchase -- only 2 prior reviews. But was pleasantly surprised.Pros:+++ Sturdy, all metal polished construction (cleanly machined surfaces, no burs, etc.)+++ Simple installation (""template"" style mounting + ability to ""pre-test"" lock prior to installation)+++ Remarkably well-written instructions (worth nothing since many are poorly written)+++ Design makes this lock likely suitable for almost any door that opens inward (only, as advertised)+++ Easy and intuitive to use; when engaged it clamps your door shut firmly with very little ""play""+++ Looks good (though obviously that\'s just my opinion)Cons:--- A bit pricey--- The strike plate ""replacement"" installation option didn\'t work for meI am ok with the price given how sturdy and finely crafted this lock is. I did see a few less-expensive locks of conceptually similar (""flip, block"") design but they didn\'t look as sturdy.Regarding the last point the # of screw holes and alignment didn\'t match our door strike plate so we couldn\'t install there, but in fairness they don\'t really push this lock as a ""strike plate"" replacement and I didn\'t buy it for that so I don\'t consider that a sufficient reason to reduce the rating on this product. In our case even had that option worked we wanted it mounted higher specifically to keep it out of reach of our mischievous twins.Bottom line: Highly recommended -- I\'m very happy with this lock and buying a 2nd for another door.201207 Update: Have successfully installed 2 of these locks and they work great. If you pay attention to detail during installation (which is reasonably easy to do) these locks provide a tight, secure latch for your doors. After months of use found no wear and tear, e.g., the finish is still shiny and unblemished. Have a friend w/young children who needed the same capability who bought the same lock and was quite happy with the results.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Very nice childproof lock. I got the brass color, which is an antiqued gold color, which goes well with our existing hardware. We had to notch out a portion of the door to install, which we did not expect. It\'s basically like a really high deadbolt.",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",Love this door lock. It blends in nicely with our white door frame. Feels secure and offers some amusement when friends come to visit and can\'t figure out how to open it. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cleaner for stop than a chain model.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",Easy to install and use.  Makes me feel a bit safer to go along with my deadbolt and alarm system.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","We added to the top of our doors to keep our 2 year old twins in the house. Works well. Looks much nicer than the chain locks. Installation did require that we put holes in the side of the door jam, but those will be easily filled if we ever wanted to remove.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","We wanted a child lock for our front door, and decided to get one that was more substantial for added security.  The lock looks nice, was easy to install and works well for what we needed.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Product works really well. Better than expected. It actually looks quite elegant. However, I spent way too much time trying to find out how product mounts, how it works and how antique brass color was going to look like. Antique brass color per company website is black and is closer to antique bronze than the color shown in their website. Out of sheer luck color worked out for me. Mounting instructions PDF file is horrible and their marketing packaging image is awful  too. Their marketing guy needs to talk to a packaging engineer. Last, the product had a few rough edges that should have been smoothed out on process. Low quality process but apparently good quality parts. I can live and work with the drawbacks of product. Would buy again.",3
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","I\'m very happy with this purchase.  I purchased this to keep my 3 year old from opening the outside door because I think the child proof door grips are ugly and too easy for him to figure out.  The Door Guardian was very easy to install, blends in with my door, and is up high enough that my toddler cannot reach.  Even though I did not buy it for security reasons, I actually do feel more secure with it latched.  I have purchased more and will be doing all my exterior doors.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Forget those cheap door guards, latches and chains.  I highly recommend the Door Guardian for your home security needs.  The installation was very simple; however, I had to use shorter screws on the wood door frame.  The 3"" screws were way too long for my situation - I believe the 1.5 or 2""  screws from Home Depot work just as good.  I had placed mine approx. 6"" above the dead bolt lock.  I also have one of those door guards that hold up against the door knob and the floor.",5

"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",it arrived quickly.  Packing was fine.  No complaint with shipping.  It doesn\'t fit our door.  The lip of the lock hardly hits the door.  Not worth installing.,1
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Bought this to keep my kids from opening the door and I LOVE it. Only downside is you can\'t open the door from the outside if it is locked on the inside and I locked myself out because of that. My oldest daughter can easily open it, but the younger two can\'t. Another plus is I didn\'t have to drill any new holes in the door which is nice since we are renting, I just removed the existing lock plate and put this one on instead.  Would recommend, just remember to unlock it if you go out the garage and shut the garage door after you or you too will get locked out. =)",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","For added security, a door guardian is a must. Gives me pece of mind and the best is that my toddler can\'t open the patio for.

"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","When our 2 1/2-year-old figured out how to open the front door I bought two of these for our front and back doors as extra safety. We live on a road where people routinely go 20 mph over the speed limit and we are also at the top of a hill with limited visibility when approaching from either direction. I needed to know she couldn\'t get outside. These seemed pricey but fit our needs and I love the added security they offer as well.The locks are heavy and feel solid. I bought a white one and a brushed nickel, they both look great but the white did have a small mark on it in the package. It\'s not noticeable unless you\'re looking for it. My husband installed one lock in 5-10 minutes, the second one we did need to chisel the frame a bit to get it to sit right but even then it couldn\'t have been more than 15 minutes to install. We\'ve tested them with some pressure and they\'ve held up well. The way they\'re installed I think they would hold up if they were ever truly tested but for our main purpose of keeping our toddler in they will definitely work. You have to use a certain maneuver to unlock them so even if she scales something to reach the lock she probably won\'t be able to unlock it. I think they were worth the money.

"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","This lock is pretty tough. It is secured by 3 long screws, which anchor it very firmly into the door frame. For the doors that don\'t have deadbolts, this is a great inexpensive option. I would certainly buy more if needed.",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",My husband installed this lock on our back patio doors (French doors) in about 15-20 minutes.  He did need to chisel away part of the frame but it\'s totally worth it for the peace-of-mind it gives us.  Our 3 year old grandson is very adventurous and the thought of him getting out without our knowing was keeping me awake at night.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it!,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","The Door Guardian is a great product for keeping little ones inside a home. We have one installed on our front door and it is very effective and easy to use. So how is this different than a standard flip lock, which may cost around 1/4 the price of the Door Guardian?We have several  of these standard locks and will use them when lock certainty is less important. First a standard flip lock uses shorter screws, limiting the security of the attachment to the door jam. Sure you could buy extra screws for the flip lock, but that is an extra step and does costs extra (still nowhere near the Door Guardian cost). Two, the Door Guardian is made with much more robust steel - I can\'t speak to the steel quality, but the lock has substantially more metal, which I must assume adds to the stability of the device. Third the closure mechanism is more solid. I have found standard flip locks can be rattled out of position is the door has enough play.Beyond security, the Door Guardian offers better aesthetics than a standard flip lock. Also the Door Guardian seems less likely to cause damage to the door that is being locked. Additionally, the Door Guardian can be used with door frames that flare out (where the wood thickness increases as you move away from the door). This is due to the fact that a standard flip lock needs to open to about 270 degrees (or to parallel to the wall - or in the opposite position to closed when mounted). The Door Guardian has an angle built into the device that allows it to sit on these angled frames. If you are confused by this explanation, please Google ""Door Guardian installation instructions"", find a PDF instruction manual, and look at figure 2B. I have been unable to attach a standard flip lock on these types of door frames without damaging the frame (becuase the frame prevents the lock from opening all the way). The last thing I would say about the Door Guardian is that it has a very easy one-handed operation. Standard flip locks are very easy to use as well, but I have found the Door Guardian a little bit easier to operate.Installation requires a 1/8"" inch drill bit for the two larger screws. If your door does not have enough space for the screw plate, which is 1/16"" inch, you may have to chisel off some material from the door frame to recess the screw plate. A short explanation of this: pencil the boarder of the screw plate on the door frame; remove the screw plate and use a chisel and hammer to create a 1/16"" inch groove along the inside of the boarder that you penciled in; chisel in a grid of grooves in the inside of the boarder; and chisel away the interior of the grooved area moving from the boarder groove inward until all the material is gone. The grooves will prevent splintering and removal of excess door frame.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"I always crack up when you see people in the movies who have those old chain-locks on their doors. Real people don\'t actually still USE those do they?!? I think they just still put them in movies so the bad guys can break in the door more easily!These brass locks should be on EVERY one of your exterior doors. They\'re easy and fast to install and you can put them nice and high so your little darlings won\'t open the door to strangers (in spite of the fact that you\'ve told them NOT to at least a bazillion times!). They\'re incredibly inexpensive, they\'ll last forever, they\'re not a bit unattractive ~ gosh, what more do you want?!? You might have to get a little more creative with a door with a window in it, but, other than that, this goodie is just that. Years ago, they used to make one exactly the same except that it was portable ~ instead of screwing into the doorframe, it had an extended piece of the brass that hooked over the ""stop"" on the doorframe (that\'s the piece that goes all the way around both sides and the top to stop the door when you close it). You simply took it wherever you went and put it on the door to keep your family safe and sound. (And if anybody ever finds any PLEASE let me know (through here) and I\'ll be eternally grateful!!!)",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"Buy this simple lock.  Very easy to install, simple to use, and provides safety for children where a door needs to be kept locked, but easy to open when an adult needs to get out.My daughter installed them after she awoke in the middle of the night to find her young child sleep walking and trying to open the front door on a freezing Idaho winter night.  I installed one on the door going down to the basement for another daughter to keep her three-year old from opening the basement door in the night.Simple, cheap, works.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"Absolutely perfect!! My two year old daughter figured out how to unlock the deadbolt and regular lock on both our front and back doors. I\'ve found her outside twice, even when I\'ve ""locked"" the doors, so I\'ve been looking for a solution with an easy install.  This flip lock installed in less than one minute and works great!  Now I can sleep a little easier, at least until she figures out how to get out the windows...but I\'m not looking to borrow trouble!!  I would definitely recommend this product.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"I installed the safety lock and it works perfectly.  I dont have to worry about my 4 year old or 1 year old son opening the door and taking off or answering when solicitors show up.  Its easy to use once you get used to it. I wouldnt want any other kind of lock for my kids\' safety, its great.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,My kids had gotten to the age where they could unlock the regular locks. We installed this and they cant open up the back door anymore. A big relief!,5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"These are really pretty nice -- low profile, easy to work, and seem to be pretty strong.  But be careful to note the description: these only work on doors that open inward (i.e., toward you when you go through them).  I was not such a careful reader and they don\'t work for the doors I wanted to use them on.  My own fault, I realize.",4
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"It works exactly the way it says it will.4 stars because of three small problems:1 - hinge should be slightly small, so that it doesn\'t scratch the door2 - it required little practice to lift it and tilt it to open3 - quality of screws supplied with it",4
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,I LOVE this hinge.  I no longer worry about my super active son slipping out.  He can\'t get escape and this will work for years to come.,5
"Prime-Line Products S 4558 Toilet Lid Safety Lock, White","First of all, I like the fact that it doesn\'t interfere with the toilet seat not like the other products.  It doesn\'t look anything very very strong that a big kid or an adult can easily remove, but it serves the purpose of keeping the lid from my 1.5 year old daughter.  Now that she\'s able to open the door handles easily, I can at least have a piece of mind that she won\'t be able to open the toilet.  I can put a door handle safety product but then I would have to open the door every time for my other daughter who is learning to go to bathroom by herself.  So it\'s safe to say that I would prefer to have this than none.  Not the best but it will do.",3
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"This is one of the most beautiful toys my son has. I love the rainbow of colors. The clackety-clack of the outer segments, the colors, and the changing shape of the globe keeps him interested. He\'ll still look at it now that he\'s 15 months old. It\'s also very durable--it shows no signs of wear still.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"My 6 month old niece loves the toy, the mirror in the back always makes her smile and giggle a lot!",4
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,The toy is really cool but one of the segments broke within 2 weeks of having it. I have 8 month babies and it is not like they were throwing this toy.,3
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"I purchased this for my son when he was 6 months old (3 months premature) because of the high developmentally benefited reviews.  He began showing interest in it immediately and slowly worked his way up to manipulating it and playing with it with purpose.  His developmental therapist even remarked how developmentally appropriate this toy is.  She wanted to know where to get one to use while doing therapy with her other students.  It is perfect for fine motor skills, raking, pinching etc. He is now 1 and he STILL carries ""click clack"" everywhere.  It is his ""travel toy"".  It is extremely durable.  He drops and throws it and you can\'t even tell.  He shows intense concentration when manipulating the ""sliders"", rolling the boy faced bell inside, and still attempts to chew and lick it.  It also functions as a rattle.  Another reviewer remarked that ""it doesn\'t roll"".  It isn\'t meant to. If you want a rolling ball (your local store has them for a dollar) then this is not for you.  However if you want an educational, highly entertaining, developmentally beneficial, extraordinary toy with purpose and educational value then this is for you.  It washes so easily in hot soapy water and air dries.  When we thought we had lost it, I ordered another one because he liked it so much.  We later found it, and having two makes it even better!  One lives in the car. I cannot stress how perfect this toy has been for my son.  Even the ""high risk"", speech and auditory evaluators prefer to use it in their testing over their own selction of tools/toys.  Everyone always wants to know where it came from and how to get it.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"I brought this one expecting that the ball spin on the floor. It doesn\'t do that, but my 6 moths boy really love this Rattle. It can be grab very easily, and it is very nice to see. I recommend this as a rattle, not as a toy.",4
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"A more advanced grab and hold toy.  Lots of things to discover such as; colors, textures, shiny mirror interior, safe moving parts that hide the happy face, and a rattle sound.  Just a great toy at a good price.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,this was okay -not worth the cost. The baby was not impressed with it. She bopped herself with it on the chin. Very hard plastic.,3
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,I love it and so does my 6 month old. This is a great toy. He creeps after it and it keeps him busy for a while,5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"This is a colorful, noisy, ball with moving parts and a glistening inside.  But...this ball doesn\'t roll in a straight line, and it is hard, meaning hard on your hands, hard on woodwork it might crash into, just hard to get the hang of how to use it in a playful way. It is called a spin ball, but it doesn\'t spin either.  ????",1
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,My little one loves to play with this. It is smaller than I expected but it was perfect for her little hands and she loved the noise that makes when the sides click-clack together.,5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"I bought this for my five month old twins.  The love watching it roll.  As it rolls, each piece opens and closes.  It also has mirrors inside as it rolls which is visually stimulating.  The outside of the ball is textured, which is physically stimulating.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,This is an interesting toy.... different than I have seen in stores. I bought three for my three grand babies ages 7 months to 11 months. They were interested in playing with it for a while. It was smaller than I expected. A video of the moving side panels would be helpful in understanding what it does before ordering.  I really appreciated the fast shipping.,4

ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"Takes a bit of patience to apply. You will need lots of coats for full coverage.  But the result is EXCELLENT. Does not rub off easily. I still have it on after a full nights sleep wearing a tank top over it.  Better to use a blot/twist motion with the sponge and then using the brush for details. Use just a tiny bit of water and blot with a paper towel before applying. My hubby painted a sunset on my belly for halloween, and I took 1st place in the costume contest.  I\'m VERY IMPRESSED!",5
ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"The paint looks great, until it dries. It chips and looks horrible. It takes forever to apply as well because the paint doesn\'t want to stay on the skin.

ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"Cute product!I bought this kit for my sister\'s baby shower. (her 3rd shower) Instead of playing the typical shower games, I decided to get her closet friends/family together to paint her belly. The shower was around Easter time so we made her belly an Egg, we all painted something on the Egg. After we were done, she took the kit home so her husband and kids could paint something. It was so much fun, easy to use, and of course, non-toxic.  I would definitely recommend this!",5
ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"This product allows you to paint colorful designs on your belly.  It certainly does that.  I had my friend, an artist, paint a beautiful Hamsa on my belly.  The colors were initially vivid, especially when applied in multiple coats as instructed.  My skin had no reaction to the paint, and it washed off easily in the shower later on.The paint kit comes with a brush & a sponge, and the following colors: black, white,  blue, pink, orange, red, green, yellow.  The paint is applied with water.  There is plenty of paint to decorate a bevy of  bellies, or to paint yourself multiple times.The downsides, if you want to see them that way, are that the paint doesn\'t stay on very long.  It is only meant to decorate and bless the belly, photograph the results, and then wash it off.  Over the next few hours, it faded like an old wooden carnival sign.  I think this is an important note for anyone who thought they would paint something and wear it around all day.  This painting kit is not meant for all-day wear.My friend, the artist, also wanted me to note that the brush is not the best quality.  She did a fine job but felt constrained by the materials.  If you want a professional piece of artwork, you may want to get your own brushes.  However, for the average person, it probably doesn\'t matter all that much.",4
ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,Lots of paint to use several times. Advise: if you have more than one &#34;artists&#34; working on you buy extra paint brushes/sponges!,5
"Baby Self-feeding Bottle Straw - Stainless, 4oz","I love this thing.  My 7 month old was having a difficult time trying to use a sippy cup and she would try to feed herself but couldn\'t tip the bottle all the way up so this was a great solution.  I can just give her the bottle and she drinks it away.  I know some review complain that it doesn\'t fit their bottles.

Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"The Me Too hook-on chair was one of the best baby buys we have made! We just used it for a week in a beach house rental on the cereal bar and it was incredible! So easy to transport, lightweight, just dropped in the sink to clean the big messes. Perfect for the restaurants we visited as well! Much better than those nasty high chairs, plus more compact so servers weren\'t bumping into our son. Our son (13 months) absolutely loved using this chair!!!",5
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We\'ve had this chair for a few months now and are thinking of getting another one for when we are out.  Our 11mo son loves to sit at the table with us and eat our food/be part of the family.pros- same height at the table, easy to use, good for limited space, compact with easy travel.  Blue (we have this one) and Black don\'t show dirt as much.  Have yet to find a table it doesn\'t work on.  We even have a 2"" hang that the chair will attach to without being a problem.cons- if there is a chair underneath it- baby can stand up, so you need to be careful.  Must use the straps or else sits sideways sometimes or stands up.  Red (my friend has) shows stains more.",4
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We initially bought this highchair for a trip but it ended up being so convinient that we are using it every day. Attaching the seat to the table is super easy and takes up a couple of minutes, plus it folds up so compact that you can put it in a diaper bag. Clean up is also super convinient, you can either wash it or wipe it with a wet cloth. I just rinse the whole thing under water (specially after a teething biscuit mess:) and it dries up in no time. My daughter loves to sit on the same level as us and another friend of mine who has an older child says it is the only chair her son can not escape from! The only little flaw with this chair is that if you go to a restaurant with thicker tables, you can not attach the seat (but this is a minor flaw, since it has only happened to us once). We love this product so much that it has become my official baby shower gift.",5
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We love this chair. We originally purchased it for an upcoming vacation, but we\'ve used it everyday since we got it. It\'s much more compact than the highchair, and my son loves sitting up at the kitchen counter and watching the action. It\'s very sturdy and easy to use, and it folds up to almost nothing.  It\'s also very easy to move, we use it on our porch table as well, and it\'s so much easier than dragging the big highchair around.  I would recommend this chair to anyone with a toddler, or baby who can sit up.",5
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We have 7 (soon to be 8) children and the Me Too chair is the best mealtime chair we\'ve ever owned.  We began with a Peg Perego high chair that took us through our first few children, but it was another piece of furniture entirely.  Large high chairs are always in the way, and we have a large kitchen so it isn\'t merely a square footage issue.  They are also a pain to clean because of the many nooks and crannies, in addition to the fact that one can\'t simply drop the high chair into a sink full of soapy water.All high chairs or boosters are work to keep clean, so if you are expecting to be able to wipe one down and walk away, you need to change your expectations.  We have had no problem washing the Me Too in the sink with soapy hot water and then allowing it to dry overnight, but we live in a dry climate.And while the Me Too might not fit every table, it fits the most-used table here- the one in our kitchen.  We can use high chairs provided by restaurants when not at home.I\'m off to purchase another for the next little guy arriving in our home soon.",5
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"As already the mother of two, I didn\'t need to buy very much (if anything) when my third child was born, but I am always amazed at some of the new things that are invented from one to the next so I was cruising around the internet looking for new gadgets when I came across this travel-high-chair.  I wish I would have had this for the first two too!  It is so handy, I always just keep in the car and take it in to restaurants or anyplace I want to have a place for my 10 mth old to sit.  Restaurant waiters/waitresses love it too because it takes up so much less space than those bulky slings or wooden high chairs.  This is my #1 recommendation as a shower gift for any mom!",5
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We have this chair attached to our counter top for our tot and we also take it to picnics and visits.

Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"Light and easy to put on the table or take off with one hand. small enough to fit in the diaper bag and sturdy enough to hold my 2 year old. Be careful, it does not fit all tables. We have run across problems with tables that have a lip, and sometimes tables in restaurants are just too thick. But this has been only a few times. Prepare for a lot of comments! Everyone walking by your table will say how cool they think it is and what a great idea.We purchased this item in 2004 and are still using it, now for our second child. I have purchased one for 3 of my other friends who eat out a lot. Keeps baby right up at the table with you.",5

She is happy there for feedings and likes being part of the family.  It wipes clean quickly and easily.  It was also sent quickly as I wanted it to arrive before Christmas.  So glad I bought this instead of a highchair!",5
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,I love this chair.  We own a sailboat and it is perfect for our daughter to sit in while we sail.  She is safe and secure and clipped on to the companion way entrance with the wind in her hair.  It\'s not just for eating.  We use it for eating also at the dinnete table down below as well as the breakfast bar at the house.  Highly recommend it!,5
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We have 17 month old triplets and traditional highchairs consumed too much space. We have a solid wood island in our kitchen and these seats attach securely and with ease. They also work well at most restaurants at booths or tables. If you have a more formal table with trim around the under edge of the table, you may not be able to attach these chairs. Assuming your table can support the weight and doesn\'t have trim, these are a great value and save space. Now all of us can sit around our island for meals.",4
Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"Our dining area is a small island with two stools. A traditional high chair was too space consuming, not high enough, did not allow our baby to feel like she was eating with us, and frankly, ugly. For those four important reasons, I really love Phil and Ted\'s MeToo Chair and my baby girl loves it too.We use it with the Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat. They work beautifully together.PROS- small, portable (folds up very small), easily attaches to table/counter- baby gets to eat with us as a family- attractiveCONS- difficult to clean. We use a scrub brush on it after every meal. It is made of a sport nylon that does not detach from the chair for cleaning. The fabric has a texture that is readily filled in by little hands smeared in mashed bananas. We wish there was an easy-to-clean liner for it.- The safety straps design is sorely lacking. It\'s more of an after thought. They do not fit well and can be easily slipped off the shoulders.",4

Phil &amp; Ted\'s Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We bought this chair for going out to restaurants and travel.  The size and weight sold us on the product.  When it fits on the table, it works like a charm.  We recently took this chair on a 3 week trip to Europe, because we knew most restaurants in France and Switzerland do not have baby chairs.  The design of many cafe tables were such that the me too chair would not fit.  The edge of the table was slanted and had a thick edge, so it was impossible to screw the chair on tightly.  We spent a lot of time finding cafes where the chair would work, but had to give up at times and feed the babies on our laps, which is never fun.  Also, if a table is light-weight, it can become unbalanced with only one child.I would certainly buy the chair again and recommend it to others ... just make sure it will fit on the tables you want to use it on.  Hopefully, the folks at Phil & Ted\'s can modify the design to fit on a wider variety of tables.",4
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,"I absolutely love my bugaboo frog, but this accessory was so nice for when my son was sleeping in the car once we got to a destination.  We used the carrier for 7 months, and definitely got our money\'s worth out of the car seat connector.  It could have been a bit easier to use, but once you get the hang of it (like folding the bugaboo, in general) it\'s a piece of cake.  I highly recommend adding this to your bugaboo purchase!",5

He\'s 13 pounds at 10 weeks so carrying the car seat stopped being an option.Well made, easy to click on and off and lightweight this adapter has it all. I only gave it 4 stars because I ordered it through an Amazon seller and not Amazon itself. They took 2 1/2 weeks to get me the right adapter; having sent me the adapter for the Maxi and some Italian car seat first. They finally sent me the correct one and I insisted that they do 2 day shipping.",4
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,"I was not sure how well it would work with my Graco SnugRide 32 since I read quite a few complaints about how difficult it is to fit a SnugRide 32 onto/off this adapter. I called Bugaboo CS about a newer version of this adapter (that was expected to come out summer 2010 according to the internet) that was suppose to work better with the 32 and he said they don\'t make it and that though the current version would work with SnugRide 32, it was not user-friendly. But I had gotten my car seat at a great price and really like the print, so I gave it a try anyway, especially after reading the other review about it working with 32.Guess how surprised I was when it took no extra effort to put the car seat onto the adapter and then the whole thing onto the Cameleon, or fix the adapter onto the stroller frame first and then put the car seat onto the adapter. It\'s just as if you were putting it onto the base in a car. Then I tried taking the whole thing off Cameleon (my first try) which was a little more work. A much easier or probably the right way to do it would be to take the car seat out of the adapter first and then the adapter off the Cameleon.I have not tried with a baby in it since my LO won\'t be here until April, but I don\'t think we will have any issue. If I have to complain about something, that would be I probably won\'t get to use the cute bassinet much now that the car seat adapts so conveniently and perfectly.",5
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,"I got the Peg Perego adaptor with the PP carseat, and it was a complete and total PITA.  I returned both items and bought the Graco adaptor and Snugride.  SO SO happy.  It\'s as easy as a snap and go.  Would absolutely recommend getting it.",5
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,"We originally had the Peg Perego Viaggio SIP 30/30 infant seat, so I bought the adapter for the Bugaboo.  The Peg adapter is very different from the Graco adapter.  The Peg adapter are just two posts that have to perfectly align with the slots in the car seat. This was practically impossible for one person!  I had to be on one side while my wife was on the other, as we aligned each post into their slots on the car seat.  It was very difficult and I was completely disappointed in the design.I then found this adapter and since it mimics the car seat base, it was SOOOO much easier to lock the car seat into the Bugaboo.  We ended up returning the Peg car seat (it was too big and way too heavy for us anyway) and bought the Graco Snugride 22.  And let me tell you, it is like night and day.  Placing the car seat onto this adapter is as easy (if not easier) than placing it on its base in the car.As for the price, I don\'t think it\'s overpriced, especially compared to the equally-priced Peg adapters, which are nothing more than just the two vertical pieces.  At least the Graco adapter has several other parts, including those extruded aluminum tubes, which justifies its price somewhat.  The Peg Perego adapters should be at least half the price of the Graco.I had no problems assembling this adapter whatsoever.  The pieces fit perfectly.  It may take a little bit of strength to push the rods/tubes into the plastic ends, but I can\'t imagine anyone having any problems with it at all.",5
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,My grandchild wanted to start sitting up in a seat instead of lying down when she went for a walk in the Bugaboo Cameleon stroller. My daughter bought this adapter to use with her Graco car seat and it works great. The adapter is very easy to use and now my grandchild sits in her Graco car seat while out for a walk with this stroller. This ability to easily convert from bassinet to car seat with a simple adapter is very convenient for the Bugaboo Cameleon.,5
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,Love this feature. is so great to just carry the car seat around. But I feel like it\'s so expensive. We only used the infant car seat for 3 months.,4
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,"This was amazing until a leaky disposable diaper meant we had to wash it.  We used the recommended Kookaburra Wool Wash and followed the directions.  The individual fibers on the sheepskin clumped together, so that it is rather like someone made a little rug out of many short pieces of yarn, and the skin is now somewhat brittle.  We tried working in lanolin, like you would for a woolie wrap cloth diaper cover, and we tried brushing the fibers with a sheep brush.  Unfortunately though it\'s now just a shadow of its former glory.  Wish I\'d never washed it.",3
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,I purchased one of these prior to my son being born last October to be used in his stroller and it has been a great product.  It really does work to insulate in the winter and I have used it all summer in Portland Oregon without a problem even on the hottest days of 90 plus degrees.  I was so satisfied with it last winter that I purchased another one for an area rug to be used primarily for tactile purposed and he really enjoyed it.  I am hoping to find one of similar quality as a mattress pad for his crib this winter as well.  I preferred this version for my stroller because it had better coverage then the one they sell for strollers and I just cut holes where it was necessary.  I should also add that the rug is easy to wash with wool cleaner on delicate cycle and it doesn\'t shed which is great because my son Christian likes to pull and suck on everything.,5
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,"It is as beautiful as pictured, and twice as soft.  All my grandchildren (8 right now, with 2 more coming soon) have spent their first year sleeping on one of these lambskins.  Some have become their ""comfort"" blankets as they grow older.",5
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,"High quality sheepskin. My children always had one for everything. Now the doctors say no anything in the bed with baby. However I still got this for my daughter and her newborn as my daughter has fond memories of hers. She even still has pieces of it tucked away in a drawer. She will use this when baby is older. Maybe as a floor play rug, or in the stroller when it is cold. There are many other uses for these. What I do know is it becomes a &#34;lovey&#34; for the child when they are older. This particular sheepskin is amazingly soft, short hair, no smell what so ever and really high quality. I think when this baby is older she will love playing on it.",5

Peg Perego 2006 Pliko Lite Stroller,"I love this stroller.  However, I don\'t think it sold well in the US because they are onl selling it in Europe in 2007.  Anyhow, I bought this specifically for a trip to the UK.  I worked out great.  Compact fold, light weight, 14 month old was able to take naps.  It did really well with the bumpy roads over there.  I couldn\'t imagine using a stroller without full shock absorbers on the wheels.",5
Peg Perego 2006 Pliko Lite Stroller,I looked long and hard for a upgraded umbrella stroller and found this one online only. I wanted one that was sturdy enough for a big diaper bag and growing baby but lightweight and compact. It met all of these requirements. Two features i would love to have are a adjustable canopy and handles. When we are walking in direct sun you can\'t pull the canopy down over him because it is attached at the back. We are also taller and the handles don\'t adjust so we have to lean down a little bit. I know our 6 month old find it very comfy though with lots of room to grow. The basket is big enough but only accessible from the front. I like that is stands up on its own when collapsed. It doesn\'t tip over with a diaper bag hanging from the handle and no baby sitting in it. It is a very smooth ride compared to the graco stroller i have. Overall I am very happy with this stroller but feel like I now need another stroller for very sunny days or i need an extra shade.,4
Peg Perego 2006 Aria Twin Stroller,"Pros:very light weightSnack tray""Floating harness""Large basketKids seem comfortableCons:Basket ""broke"" after 7 months of intermittent use (dragged on the ground when nothing was in it)Doesn\'t really stand alone when folded (very precarious)Front wheels go in 2 different directionsDecals peeled offWe bought this as our mall/errand stroller for our twins when they were 5 months old. It was great for a few months and things started to go wrong. The wheels go in 2 different ways making getting through doors difficult (as it JUST fits through the door), the basket started to drag (and got a hole) even though it has never been overloaded (we hang bags and packages on the handle bar), and the decals just fell off. Yes, it is lightweight, but not worth the headaches that come with it.Now it just sits in the garage. We use our Baby Jogger as our everyday stroller.",3
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","Are you ever at a party, and wish that you could see adults fumble with a baby gate and look foolish?  Its always hilarious!  Then buy this right now, dont even think about it.  Don\'t go look in your bank account to see if you have the correct funds, just stack it on top of your growing credit card bill and GET THIS GATE; I cant recommend it enough. Seriously it keeps nonsense OUT: place all unwanted things in your life on one side, you get on the other.  Oooohhhmmmmmm (yoga bear) life is good.  put out the incense! thats so 90s",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",Easy to set-up and use. Very sturdy and worth the money! I would definitely recommend this product. Fits perfectly in a door way. Option to buy extensions.,5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",This is my second gate like this we have one on another door.  They are the best I\'ve found.  They don\'t break and bend like the plastic ones do.  I would highly recommend this gate.,5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","We use them for our dogs to keep them safe, easy to install and easy to walk through!  We have three of them !",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",I bought this gate for my puppies because they kept going in my kids rooms chewing their beds and this really does the job of keeping them out. I had a smaller gate and my Beagle kept jumping it. The gate was easy to put up and is easy for my kids to open it and I love how it closes and locks all by itself because my kids would never do that lol this is a great product and if I have anymore problems of keeping dogs out I will difently buy another one.,5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",This gate is great and it was very easy to install (I was a little worried because it looked like it would be a lot harder).  I liked that it could be pressure mounted since we rent and would like to decrease the amount of holes we put into the walls.  The only complaint I have is that the latch seems to stick so it can be a little tricky to open at times.,4
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","I bought this for my 16 month old baby. They are very easy to mount,nice auto close, Well built. Pretty strong. Buy it. My baby is strong enough and she hangs on to it, kicks it but no use, She could never open. For now, i like it. My stairways are 43"" and i could not find a perfect suitable gate. This one matched my criteria. Perfectly fitted.",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","I think this is a great safety gate, especially for the price.We bought this for the nursery, so we can leave the door open but keep the dogs out of the room. The gate installs really easily -- it took my husband a few minutes max -- and it looks better than some safety gates. The auto-close feature is a good idea for a safety gate, but it would be nice if you could disable it somehow. It does get annoying if I am just running in and out of the nursery and don\'t want it to close behind me.My biggest complaint, however, is the thumb latch that opens the gate. It\'s not the easiest to use. You have to slide it back and pull upwards at the same time, which is not impossible, but sometimes it feels \'stuck\' and you have to do the motion again. It is not a huge deal, but it does get annoying.Even with those complaints, I still would recommend this gate -- especially if you are going to use it for a room or doorway that you don\'t go in and out of very often.",4
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","I have regalo gate and this gate at home. Regalo needs two hands most of the time. This gate is truly single handed. Swings both ways. The opening is bigger than Regalo. Off the two gates I have, I love dreambaby.",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",We just moved to a new house and needed a gate so our older cat wouldn\'t try to escape out the front door. We bought 2 gates and really like them both. This gate swings either way and closes behind you. It was a snap to install and we did not attach the cups to the wall. It has been a great product and I\'m very pleased.,5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","Or in my case, dog gate. Easy to install, can be permanent or movable, works great, handy one-hand operation with locking, and no cross bars that the dogs (or an enterprising toddler) can climb over! Have 3 of these, planning on at least two more!",5
Phil &amp; Teds Sleeping Bag - Charcoal,"We bought this to use for our infant daughter in our city mini baby jogger.  It fits in there nicely and kept our daughter very warm during out visit in Ohio and Chicago over the winter.  We live in California and it is not as cold here, but we still get good use out of it and just don\'t zip it all the way up if we don\'t want her to be as warm.",5

Petunia PickleBottom Tutu Roll- Diaper Bag,"The bag is absolutely beautiful and well made. I love the silk brocade shiney floral pattern. The colors are very soft and elegant. It\'s very light weight yet sturdy. It\'s roomy yet not bulky at all. I don\'t have to bring my own purse any more. If you can\'t handle it with care, I wouldn\'t recommend this kind of bag because of its embroidery material. To me it\'s surely the most girlie and stylish diaper bag. I love ""showing it off"" with my baby!",5
Sababa Toys Fisher-Price Pull-a-Tune Xylophone,"Nothing special.  Many more higher quality instruments out there.  This is okay, but one of the bars is out of tune, which is why we returned the previous plastic xylophone to the store we purchased it from.  Disappointed this one was the same result.  But, we kept it.  Had it for a few years now.  The string is too short to actually play the xylophone with the mallet, so I had to cut it off.  Kids like it fine, but don\'t play it as much as I thought they would.",3
Sababa Toys Fisher-Price Pull-a-Tune Xylophone,"WARNING: This review was made when the toy was about twenty bucks.  I noticed today that it\'s listed for more than sixty.  No way is this worth that much.-------------Pros:- plays a nice tune when it\'s pulled- colorful metal notes- soft edges everywhere- tones are pleasant- seems pretty durable so farCons:- string on the wand is laughably short (so much so that you can\'t actually use the wand on some of the notes)- metal notes are just a little too narrow because of the plastic knobs holding them in place; forces the player to be pretty accurate in their aim to get a clear tone, and a toddler just isn\'tFind a heavy shoelace and lengthen the string by several inches.  If you\'re worried this would be a strangulation hazard, then plan to either take the wand off entirely, or have a frustrated child whenever the wand jerks short when they try to use it to hit the notes.",4
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"I am giving this item 3 stars because it did get the job done in that we were able to attach it to my carry-on luggage. Thankfully we also brought a stroller because I would not have been comfortable toteing my daughter in the carseat as I was never able to get it totally secure. The ToteaTot is extremely hard to adjust and must be perfectly adjusted before attaching to luggage. It is cumbersome to reattach at each connection and going through security. We have used it for one two way flight and the mesh pockets on the diaper bag are all ripped up. Despite my complaints, it would have been incredibly difficult to not have had it. I will be in search of something of better quality and design for our next trip.",3
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"This product was very disappointing.More importantly, it is NOT SAFE/SECURE. The product I received had a snap buckle that would just pop open again when a little tension was applied to the strap. This would have meant the car seat toppling forward, maybe even injuring my child. I had to bend the prongs on the male part of the buckle several times before I was able to get the buckle to stay fastened when pulling on the ends of the strap.  Even though I eventually got it to stay buckled, I wasn\'t comfortable using it to tote my child, because I wondered if over time the buckle would bend back again and suddenly pop open, or if it had been weakened by my bending it and might just snap.Also, it is not as easy to attach/remove as claimed. Adjusting it correctly takes quite a bit of fussing with the straps, and detaching/reattaching (to go through airport security, for example) is a pain. Just unclipping the straps (which for some reason clip on opposite sides of the luggage, so you can\'t do both at one time) still leaves you with the straps dangling awkwardly from your bag. You then have to tie them up out of the way so they don\'t get caught in the x-ray machine or in the wheels of the bag, for example.I also wasn\'t comfortable with the stress this design puts on the pull-up handle of my rolling carry-on. I have a Samsonite (pretty durable, good quality), but the way the weight of the seat + child pulled on the handle of my carry-on, it felt like the handle might bend or break. If you used this to carry just the car seat itself with no child inside, then it would be okay (but still more trouble than it\'s worth).Finally:  The straps are thin, much thinner than a seat belt, so the seat tended to move around a bit, even with the straps quite tightly secured and properly adjusted.I returned the product, and came up with a much better solution using just the built-in accessory strap on my rolling carryon (you know, the strap that most carry-ons have that will let you attach a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag). I used that strap for the top, and for the bottom, I used an American Tourister luggage strap (nice and wide, like a seat belt, with very secure buckles), which I got in a package of 2 for $10.",1
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,I bought this for travel by myself with two kids. I had one in a backpack and the 2+ year old in the TOTEaTOT. It works well but you need a certain size handle and a strong suit case. I did not have problems with the buckles opening up though! It worked okay but it can be hard to pull with a 30+ lbs on board. Also a HUGE draw back is that you cannot roll it all the way to your seat as the car seat does not fit down the ail. Something I had not thought of and was crucial to traveling alone.,2
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"These are definitely something I would recommend if flying with small children! So handy!! Just strap the kids carseats onto the front of your carry-on bag, and poof you have a stroller. Then you take the carseats off and use them on the airplane seat.",5
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"I tried this and it would not keep my carseat off the ground.  The carseat was too heavy or I could not get it cinched tight enough.  After fiddling with it for 20 mins with my toddler standing and waiting for me, I just dragged my carseat through the airport strapped to the suitcase with everyone staring at me.  No way would I put my kid in it.  Waste of money.",1
"Crumb Chum Lightweight Waterproof Supersize Bib (5-15 months, Blue Hot Air Balloons)",I got the Crumb Chum after my daughter was probably a year old. I wish I had had it when she was a refluxy baby ruining all of her clothes and bibs with spit-up and various other stains. The Crumb Chum covers the whole outfit and keeps her clean from head to toe. It even catches most everything she drops so it doesn\'t get all over the floor. She can even eat while wearing her church clothes with no worries. She is 3 1/2 now and I still use it occasionally. We are definitely buying a couple for our new baby boy that we\'re now expecting. I don\'t think it\'s hard to wash in the sink. You just rinse it off and then throw it over the dish drainer to dry. It dries super fast too. Great buy for any mom and baby.,5
"Crumb Chum Lightweight Waterproof Supersize Bib (5-15 months, Blue Hot Air Balloons)",I am not one to do laundry and now I have less loads!  My son makes such a mess I can\'t believe it.  None of the other bibs worked but the Crumb Chum does the trick.  Everywhere I go everyone wants to know where I got it! I even bought tow...one for the road and one at home...,5

Ginsey Spongebob Squarepants Pedal Bin,"This is a great pedal bin in terms of quality and price. Item comes with 2 parts, one metal printed outer bin and one plastic inner bin. I purchased two, one for my son and one for my friend. My friend has the same comment and enjoys using it a lot. I use it as a restroom trash can. My 2 year-old throws out his own dirty diaper eversince because he loves to step on the pedal. A good buy!!",5

We\'re still waiting for our baby girl to arrive, but I know she\'ll look angelic wrapped up in this blanket.",5
Stokke Xplory Footmuff Color: Red,I like this foot muff purely because of its functionallity.  It keeps my little one nice and toasty when it\'s cold.What I don\'t like is that the footmuff pictured is not the one I received.  The pictured footmuff is red with a pattern on the inside.  The one I got was more of an orangy red color with just a beige inside with no pattern.  My husband describes the footmuff as a lobster fisherman color.I love all Stokke products so the only reason this did not get 5 stars is because I got the wrong footmuff.,3
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"I wasn\'t sure of this product when I bought, but it is definitely worth the money and has saved my ten month old son from several bumps and bruises (he gets a little rowdy in the tub). The only reason I gave it four stars is because it needs to be cleaned frequently. My son loves playing in the water, so he takes two baths a day and because the liner stays wet almost constantly it needs to be cleaned about once a week. If it isn\'t, it will grow mold and at that point it is really difficult to clean. Oh, and our tub is slanted in the back and I had no problems with the suction cups sticking to it ( I think one reviewer did).",4
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,Would have been very nice if it had a liner at the bottom with a heat indicator. Also wish the top edges were a little bent to cover tub edges.,3
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"The suction cups do not work in our tub!  It is more of a hazard than help.  If my daughter barely bumps into the liner, all the suction cups come undone and it folds in ontop of her!!!!",1
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"We love the liner, although it doesn\'t fit all the way around our tub- my fault I did not think to measure first. Yes, there could be improvements, but I don\'t think there is any better item of its kind out there, so for now, it is peace of mind. Also, I thought I could inflate it just using my old lungs, but no way....we bought a Coleman low-pressure air pump at Target for 20- and it works like a dream (but a loud one).",5
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"I LOVE this product.  All new mothers should include this on their registry, how we\'ve lived without it for this long, I\'ll never know!  It is a wonderful safety product that has been overlooked until now.",5
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"Don\'t waste your time with this product. The design in inherently flawed. The buoyancy provided by the water in the tub provides enough force to overcome the suction cups. In addition if your toddler decides to grab it, it may give way and cause your toddler to slip and potentially hit thier head. Amazon should remove this product from their website!",1
Basic Comfort Ultimate Crib Sheet - Flowers,"I have several of these from my older daughter and they make chnging much easier.  Unfortunatley, the newer versions seem shorter in length and barely stretch along the length of the crib.  My daughter is 2 and a half, so this isn\'t a problem, but if she were very small, I would worry she could get caught.",3

"Kiley Madison Kumfie Baby Blanket, Light Pink Bumps With Pink Tahiti","This blanket is almost more like a playmat, in that it\'s so fluffy thick that it seems more suited to laying on rather than under---it\'s beautiful and soft and nice quality.  I like it!",4
Basic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Lilac,"I\'m pleasantly surprised by these covers.  I bought two (lilac and ""sage"") when my baby was born and I\'ve been switching them off since, washing each about once a week for 18 months, and they both look the same as when I bought them: no pilling, the seams have stayed together, the elastic has stayed stretchy, they have not shrunk.  Only one thing, the color ""sage"" is really a mint/lime green.  I\'m not complaining because I like the color, but if you\'re trying to match a baby\'s room, keep that in mind.**Update**  These have to be the best product I\'ve ever bought for the money.  Seven years and two babies later, I have the same two covers, and they still look like new.  I wash them about once every other week (I have taken to putting a cloth diaper in the high traffic butt-zone and changing that out more often).",5
Basic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Lilac,Great value for price.  Glad I picked up a few of them.,5
Basic Comfort Lamp Shade &amp; Base - Flowers/Metal,"I bought a few things in the flowers collection from basic comfort. I really like this lamp. It was only $10 and it complements the room without being big and bulky. It will definately be put up on the dresser because the shade does not screw onto the base securely, it just rests on top. I really like the way it looks and with a small bulb, it lets off the right amount of light for night-time changings.",5

"Mam Love And Affection Size One Silicone Value Pack, Multiple Colors","I think these pacifiers are great; they work either way so at night you don\'t have to feel around for a notch to make sure they\'re going in the right direction. They don\'t leave marks around my baby\'s mouth like another pacifier did. I believe the company is European, maybe that\'s why they\'re not as widespread in the U.S., but they\'re made well. The attachment is so useful, especially when you\'re out and about with the baby.

"Sassy Baby 2 Piece Suction Cup Gift Set, Multiple Colors, 894/8369","The toy with the ring attached works good. It takes a good bit to knock it loose. The toy with the moon, however, is top heavy.

"Sassy Baby 2 Piece Suction Cup Gift Set, Multiple Colors, 894/8369","While it worked, my baby (7 months) loved this toy.  For us the suction worked just fine, but it was sort of moot since he was able to pull it off of the suction base and play with it. Either way, the music and sounds it produced really kept him entertained.Then two weeks later it stopped working.  Not a sound, not a peep.  So I pulled out my screw driver set to see if I could change the battery. Well, the toy uses triangle shaped slots in the screw head, so none of my screw drivers (slot, phillips, hex) work.  So now I can\'t change the battery and I have a worthless toy (he\'s bored with it now that it doesn\'t make sounds).",2
"Sassy Baby 2 Piece Suction Cup Gift Set, Multiple Colors, 894/8369","Save yourself the hassle. Skip this product.  I was VERY Excited to purchase this for my three month old.

I stuck it on her high chair tray, and walked away, came back 2 minutes later and it wasn\'t even attached.  There wasn\'t even a baby IN the chair and it had unstuck on it\'s own.  I finally managed to get it to stick for a short amount of time, but am very disappointed in this product.  Luckily it was cheap.Save yourself the time and hassle and purchase the Fisher Price Rainforest Spinning Suction Toy.  It actually does stick and STAYS Stuck.  I am much happier with it.

"California Baby Diaper Rash Cream Tube - Calming, 2.9 oz (Pack of 3)","I purchased this product at a store since I\'ve used California Baby products in the past and think that they are ok. The store I was at didn\'t carry the Weleda brand of diaper cream that I typically use, which is why I branched out and got what I thought was a reasonable substitute. My little guy had not had true diaper rash before using this cream, just a little redness here and there. When I used it, he writhed in pain and howled, which is something he\'s never done with diaper cream before. That night, he woke up a number of times and couldn\'t be soothed. I couldn\'t figure out what was going on. In the morning, everywhere I put the cream was extremely red, shiny, and raw. That day, he had difficulty sitting down. We immediately stopped using the cream and went back to our trusty Weleda, which healed the sore tush in a few days. Totally perplexed, I looked up the California Baby cream on Amazon and was shocked to see that others had a similar experience. It was really horrific to see my son in so much pain. I really can\'t believe something that is meant to be used on sore areas is so caustic. If you are thinking about using this product, I encourage you to think twice!",1
Avalon Diablo Pitch Stroller,"i really wanted to like this stroller. it\'s beautiful, taller than maclarens, has a wider seat and just looks so darned cool!first off, let me say this: if you like maclarens (and if you like them, chances are you really LOVE them!) than this may not meet your needs or satisfy your desire for a smooth ride. it does not AT ALL compare, regardless of what the very few UK-based reviews might say. no comparison for true mac users.second i have to say that the first one i received arrived damaged due to a hole in the box that happened during shipping (it had created a burn-like mark on the canopy) and the replacement that amazon sent had a broken canopy clip. it was only then that i realized the clips could break easily on anyone. mine arrived in this condition, though i could see them breaking after normal use because the plastic isn\'t very durable. i didn\'t want another replacement so i duct taped the clasp and took a stroll to the library.at first i had been excited because of the one-hand seat recline mechanism, which seemed easier than the maclaren recline but then my son fell asleep on the way home and i realized that both hands (and some muscle) are necessary to recline the seat when the weight of a child is pushing against it. it is not smooth at all and actually woke my son up, so if you have a toddler beware - this may not be an issue for people with small babies. but speaking of the weight of children, the max. capacity for this stroller is 33lbs, again not at all comparable to maclarens but i couldn\'t find this information anywhere prior to purchase and try calling avalon customer service (they\'re the distributor\'s of this product in america). chances are you won\'t be able to get ahold of them - i had tried, to see if i could get the damaged canopy replaced before amazon sent the replacement. anyhow my son is a large two year old who is already pushing 30lbs and in this stroller, despite it\'s large size, it was apparent that it wouldn\'t withstand the weight of a heavier child. i\'m sure it\'s easier to manouever and operate with infants but i wanted this to last us at least a year, though the wheels began to squeak on the way home from the library. sure some WD-40 could fix it, but after just an hour of use? not happy with that at all. i\'ve decided to just return the second one and purchase another maclaren because at least then i\'ll know i\'ll be able to push my son around without issues until he hates strollers or weighs 55lbs, whichever comes first.i still give this stroller 2 stars because it does look cool and i believe it has some functionality that makes it worthwhile IF you don\'t mind using it until your child outgrows it which may be as early as 18 - 24 months. the height and width of the seat makes it appear sturdy and seems inviting for strolling around large and/or heavy children but the chassis and overall design says otherwise. i do like the fact that the boot isn\'t just a blanket that you attach to the stroller but also has a liner which can be left on for extra padding, by unzipping the boot portion. i think, though, that in the end you get what you pay for. so there are some cool features and a cool design but because it is less than half the cost of similar strollers with similar features, that should say a lot about the product.",2
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"This is one of those toys you need many off just to have around the game room. They are soft and durable, not loud and will provide fun for all ages...first to explore the cute things on each side...then to stack up around the room.....then to throw at each other without hurting themselves or things around the room. They will provide fun for all ages through out your kid raising experience...we have had them for years.",5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"Our child was fascinated with tags, so we bought this and thought we\'d hold onto it for a month for her birthday.  Too late, she stopped being so interested in tags.  This toy is great, though, just what she would have liked a month or so before we gave it to her.  It\'s colorful and sturdy and well made.  We\'ll pass it on to someone with a younger child.",4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I would have liked to know if these blocks were stack-able, they are somewhat difficult to stack on each other even though the picture seems to do so well.  My son does love that each block has something different two have different rattle sounds, one has an interesting crackling sound and one has a little squeaking button and of course he likes the little taggies.  My son is 10 months, I wish I would have gotten these sooner for him to play with, I still got him some stacking cups which he LOVES to knock over!",4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,Taggies big soft blocks.  My 6 moonth old Granddaughter loved these blocks (so did my nine year old West Highland White Terrier).  They have little tags everywhere and are very tactile as well as cute animal designs.  They are very well made and will last a long time.  The fun animal designs will be more interesting as baby gets older.,5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I would not buy these soft blocks again.  I love Taggies products, but was very disappointed with these blocks.  I like to thoroughly clean the toys I purchase before my son plays with them.  I tossed these in a pillowcase and threw them in the wash machine.  After that they totally lost their shape and then a couple days later they began to smell musty. If you do buys these, do not wash them.",2
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,I absolutely love this product! My baby girl wont put these blocks down because she enjoys them so much! The taggies on them make for hours of entertainment for her.,5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,fun for little ones,5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"Bought this in hopes to use it at Grandma\'s, beach, the park and the occasional vacation if there is no crib.So far, my 10 month old takes one nap a day in it; to get her used to it when we really need her to sleep in it.  She really enjoys playtime in it too.  Really glad I picked up the plus size Peapod.  She still has plenty of room to grow into, and the windows have shades for naps.I decided to pick up the Sage Peapod because it was gender neutral and comes with a hand pump for the mattress.  Didn\'t think I would need the sleeping bag from the red/blue one, and I believe the frame is heavier on the red/blue.  For naps, I place my own cotton sheet inside and she goes in a sleepsack.  The Quicksilver Peapod does not include a pump, and the Peapods with self-inflating mattresses only come in blue Camo or pink.Wished Kidco would provide a self-inflating mattress for the gender neutral tents.It\'s really easy to setup, minus the few minutes it takes to pump the mattress.  Folds up compactly and easily once you figure it out.",4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I\'m an early childhood teacher/nana and know the benefits of block play for children.  It\'s sometimes hard to find blocks for the youngest of children.  Recently, I became a grandmother, and wanted to buy my grandson his first set of blocks.  (I also bought him his first doll.) I looked at many blocks and chose these. This set of soft blocks is absolutely wonderful. They are bright, soft, easy to handle and visually appealing.  I would recommend these for any baby.",5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,I purchased these blocks as a Christmas gift for my 8 month old son. They are very cute but my son doesn\'t seem as interested as I thought he would be! Hopefully he will begin to enjoy them as he gets a bit older.,4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"Cute, soft.....6 month old loves them !Much better than than the hard blocks that they can drop on their face when lying down.",5
Taggies Look At Me! Activity Mirror for Baby,"My son had this double sided toy in his crib all the way up until he started using it as a step to climb out of his crib...word to the wise! But for the non-climbing kids, this is a great toy that can either be used as a crib toy or for tummy time on the floor. It has several tags that they can pull on and explore, the mirror is great (reflection isn\'t too morphed) and the lullaby light up feature on the reverse side was also an unexpected bonus. I definitely plan to use this again for my newborn daughter when she transfers to the crib. Very versatile, cute looking animals and I love that it\'s gender neutral.",4
Taggies Look At Me! Activity Mirror for Baby,"I highly recommend this toy.  The animals, music, and tags, but especially the mirror are great for many stages of development.",5
Taggies Clickety Twist Toy,"We ordered this for our daughter\'s first Christmas a year and a half ago, and she STILL enjoys playing with this toy.  The clickety noises, the colorful characters, and the silky taggies keep her entertained.",4
Taggies Stack \'N Nest Cups,Can\'t stand this toy. My son takes the center ball out and throws it. That is as much action as this toy has seen. It\'s been in the toy box since we got it 6 months ago. It\'s adorable but he just doesn\'t care about it. The fabric the toy is made out of makes me cringe. I have eczema on my hands so I am sensitive to fabrics. This toy\'s fabric is rough and clings to my skin like velcro. I can\'t touch it anymore. It\'s very cheap stuff. The quality of construction is great it\'s just the fabric that sucks. The little windows that line up and make animals are really cute. I\'m sure it would be educational if my son liked it but he\'s totally in to cars and crashing things together instead of nesting cups and lining up animal faces.,2
"Blueberry Diaper Bag, RED","Got this in Red for a diaper pail liner.  Paired it with a 10 gal flip top trash can and it fits perfect.  We use it to toss cloth diapers and the little ones laundry.  The bag itself is very well made.  And MADE IN USA!!!  The red is very vibrant!  Drawstring at top...easy open, easy close.",5
"Blueberry Diaper Bag, RED","SwaddleBees Diaper Pail Liner & Laundry BagAbsolutely love this diaper pail liner.  The material is super thick, waterproof, and the cow print is too cute.Desperately Driven Mom\'s is a great company, and their customer service is unbeatable.Thanks again Amazon.",5
"SwaddleBees Hemp Pocket Fitted Cloth Diaper, Large",I love these diapers.  They are soft and give me the flexibility to add one or two (or three) liners.  Love these!,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"This toy is cute.  The little tags are silky and provide a good tactile experience for baby.  It also makes a nice soft musical sound when shaken.  I wish the vibrating piece was easier for babies to pull, but my baby still loves this.",4
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,My seven month old grandson loves this toy. It is soft and colorful. His little hands can grasp it easily and he loves the rattle effect. Highly recommend.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,I noticed my son sucking on the tags of his bibs and bought this for him. My son loves both his tag toys. I also bought a tag ball. They both keep him occupied.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,My 6 months old son got this toy as a Christmas gift.  He loves it!  He likes to play with all the little tags.  The design is great for little hands to grab and hold on to this toy.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"I like it but it\'s a surface wash only item. Kind of stinks since my baby sucks on it. So, not reusable....disposable.",4
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was a baby, she\'s four now, and she still carries it everywhere with her and sleeps with it every night. It\'s REALLY cute!!!!",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,I purchased this for my 4-month-old grandbaby and he absolutely loves it. Lots of tags to hold and chew on. I would definitely recommend this toy for babies/toddlers.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"A year ago, I bought Taggies for Christmas for my cousin\'s baby.  She told me that her son loved it.  Once it came time for me to have my daughter, she told me that I should get a Taggies for her too.  I got a Taggies for her.  She is five months old now, and since she was three months old she and Taggies have been BFF.  When I wash Taggies and give him back to her, her eyes light up because she is so happy to have it back.  Taggies keeps her calm, and I even use him as a distraction while trying to get her to eat her cereal, which works.  My husband and I agree that we don\'t know what we would do without Taggies.",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"We purchased this toy in order to have something ""new"" on an airplane trip.  It was a big hit and immeditately became a favorite.  The tags hold my little one\'s attention--there are so many to choose from, and he loves to eat the elephant\'s trunk.  He\'s only six months old but I\'m predicting it will stay at the top of the toy chest!",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"Loved the elephant.  Exactly as pictured.  I am giving it as a shower gift, so I hope the baby loves it.",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,My son is 3 months old and smiled the moment I took the Elephant out of the box.  He loves to hold and chew on it.,4
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"Aw this thing is great!  So far it\'s my favorite baby toy I\'ve received for my little one.  The textures are wonderful and varied, the sounds the toy makes are gentle and lovely and the design is perfect for babies with their grab reflex.  My only regret when it comes to buying Taggies Grabby Elephant is that I only bought one!  I really would love to get more for my friends\' babies, because they\'re awesome.  :)",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Much better than a bulky tub. Baby seemed to enjoy too! great for infants!,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I have been using this sponge with Ikea\'s baby bath tub for the past 2 months since we brought our daughter home from the hospital. It has turned out to be a perfect choice. I got an expensive plastic baby bather as a shower gift but it never left the box.My baby complained only the first time she took a bath. Since then she loves it and even when she is fussy stops crying the moment I put her into the water.I was able to give her a bath even when the belly button stump was still there-it didn\'t get wet.I recommend using a squirt bottle to spray the baby with. I\'ve been using the one I was given in the hospital. Also foaming shampoo is better than the regular one because you will always use less of it, and ultimately baby\'s skin won\'t get irritated. I have been using the Mustela newborn-even though it is a little expensive.Finally-you cannot beat the price!I highly recommend this product",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"This is very good quality and the baby is supported even when it is soaked. I have been laying it on the counter next to our kitchen sink to wash him, but now that he\'s bigger I think I will start to fill the bathtub a little and put the sponge in the tub. This makes giving him a bath so easy though. I love it!",4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Love it so much easier to use than the big tub.. Doesn\'t take much room.I would recommend hanging in a pant hanger to dry so it doesn\'t stink like mildew.,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Wow, I\'m glad I discovered this bath sponge. It\'s perfect for bathing a newborn in the bathtub without having to wrestle him into a sink and worry about bonking his head on the faucet. My husband is able to safely cradle the baby between his legs while laying the baby on the sponge and the baby seems to feel very secure and relaxed during bath time. This is such a cost effective bathing tool and it dries very quickly, too.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Quality was worth the price! It even works for larger babies over 27 inches. Would recommend this purchase to anyone seriously looking!,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"It gets the job done. But it is cheaply made. Works great when put in the fisher price, make bath time more enjoyable. That hard plastic in the fisher price tub must be uncomfortable my daughter could not seem to relax while giving her a bath. I got this thinking it would make the little tub more comfortable. It is also warmer than the plastic on the FP tub. Bath time is now enjoyable and she is able to relax.",4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,I bought it but never used it.First baby? Think about the following:Where would you bath the baby - the most important thing (after safety) is that you don\'t strain your back!Do you have a place to put this where:- it fits- you can safely wash the baby and drain the water- you can maintain a normal upright postureI didn\'t :(,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,I had this product when my children were babies and loved it then!  You can use a regular bathtub hands free and the babies love being submerged in warm water.,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Bathe your squirmy infant with confidence! Comfy for him/her and they stay put.A must have item for parents of newborns.,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Just what I ordered!  I had one of these when my kids were babies, and this is just what I was looking for.  It\'s safe and easy to use for my grandbaby!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"This spounge is an amazing value for the price.  It is hearty and holds up wash after wash, it is also soft and cushy and perfect for baby or toddler to lean back on.  A must have!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,it was comfy for my son-- but it\'s bulky and impossible to dry after baths.  so the mold came -- despite my efforts to squeeze and hang it -- in just over a week.  4 or 5 baths and mold was growing inside and out.  disgusting and dangerous!!!,1
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I received a premium infant ""spa"" bath as a gift which included a cot-like attachment for the newborn phase. However, I still seemed to always have to use 1 hand to hold the head while bathing and because my baby\'s body was only half submerged I felt he was chilly despite the warm water. I looked into some other brands and nothing seemed too impressive, my Mom told me about these sponge cut-outs she used with us as babies. I found this brand and decided to try it out and it is the PERFECT solution! It craddles the baby and keeps his head in place and out of the water PLUS the sponge absorbes the warm bath water to keep his body warm while I bathe him, it turned bathime from a chore into one of his favorite activities! I use this in the infant tub, but could easily be used in a sink (my bathroom sink is too shallow otherwise this would be my preferred method) or placed in the bathtub. Not only is it an inexpesnive substitute for buying an infant tub but I would actually reccomend this over one.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Our 6-month-old son would scream and scream whenever we bathed him, until we purchased this. Now he just relaxes and enjoys the baths, and bedtime has become much easier as a result. This is easy to use -- it can sit inside his infant bath, or directly in the tub, and works fine in either position. It holds him tightly in place, so we don\'t have to worry about him slipping around. I\'d highly recommend this for anyone who has a child that doesn\'t like bath time.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"During the first week, this sponge was AMAZING. We would put it in the tub to give my son some cushioning until he outgrew it (it is kind of bulky, which is fine if you have an average size baby)but now I use it to put him on after his bath when I dry him off. It\'s nice and comfy for him.I haven\'t experienced any kind of mold, and it has gotten completely wet several times. When it tells you to wring it out, WRING IT OUT until your hands feel like they\'re about to fall off.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I used an infant bath sponge like this one for both of my children and the foster babies we tended.  I have, also, given it as part of a baby gift.  I can\'t praise the product strongly enough.For new borns, I placed the sponge on the counter top beside the sink.  I, then, had both hands free to bathe the baby.Until a child could sit up, I used the sponge in the bathtub.  I would fill the tub with water to the level of the sponge.  Again the sponge held the baby so I had two hands free to do the bathing.When finished, just wring out the sponge and set it in the corner of the tub.It\'s lightweight, so it is easy to take if you travel.Once a child could sit up, I had them sit on the sponge and didn\'t worry about them slipping and possibly hitting their head on the tub.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,This bath sponge is a relaxing way to bathe even a newborn (once the cord is ready)! He can lay on his back securely and stay warm in the kitchen sink.  Can\'t beat the price too.  My only question is whether there are any chemicals in the sponge material.  I prewashed the sponge and used a cloth napkin over it at first but since then have placed him directly on it and see no skin irritation.  I highly recommend this product.,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I have had 7, yes 7, kids and have tried many bath time products.  This is by far my favorite and I\'ve purchased one for each of my kids as they have had kids of their own.  No slipping.  Offers some &#34;hands free&#34; bathing and they love to feel the warm water without just their tushy sitting in the water.  LOVE IT!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,There\'s not much to say about it... it\'s just nice having a cushy bath sponge for my son\'s two year old butt to sit on in the bathtub.  Also kept him from sliding around when he was younger and we just stuck with it.  We\'ve gone through about four of them so far.,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,This works really well for washing and bathing a newborn infant.  I feel confident lying our baby onto this sponge and it is a much softer surface for him than right into the sink or tub.  I also have it in the bath when co-bathing.  I\'m not sure how much longer we will find it useful though (already at 2 months now).  Maybe a couple more months of use?  Then perhaps I will cut it up and use it as normal bath sponges!,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I bought it at Target and promptly threw away my First Years   It\'s convenient and comfortable for her, and easy to clean for me.  I do wish it had a softer seat because if she\'s reading a book on the potty chair for a few minutes and gets up, her butt has a red mark from sitting so long.",5
Potty Chair Color: White,Happy with it!  Now he just needs to use it!!!It has good support and sturdy. He is able to lean back comfortably.,4
Potty Chair Color: White,"We\'ve had this potty for our son, and will soon be using it for our daughter - it\'s still in perfect condition, works great, it\'s small and portable if you need to take it with you anywhere. It is extremely easy to clean - all smooth surfaces that are very easy to wash/wipe, no nooks and crannies where germs can hide.",5
Wallcandy Arts Big Green Chalkboard Circles With Chalk - 1 Kit,"I previously purchased these circles for my son\'s bedroom - he\'s 3 years old.  He loves them.  He loves to write on them as much as he loves to erase them.  They\'re fun, and they look great in his room.I thought it would also be fun to have them in my office at work, and they have been.  Only one problem though.  They don\'t stick as well on my office walls as they do at home.  I came into the office the next day after putting them up, only to find one of them on the floor all curled up.  Since then, I have had to put tape around the perimeter of the circles, as that is the only way they stay in place.Despite the ""stickiness"" issue, I do enjoy having them on my wall.  They encourage my coworkers to put up messages for me, and we have begun a ""Spanish Word of Day"" feature on my wall.",4

Disney Winnie The Pooh Come Out and Play 4-Piece Toddler Set,"My little boy\'s nursery is Winnie the Pooh, and he really likes the ""Beh"" as he calls him.  So when we bought a toddler bed, we were looking for Pooh.  We found a Pooh bed we like, but the only sheets I could find were definitely girly--until this set.  It\'s very cute and quite cheerful, and it works well with the decor we have.  My only complaint is that the sheets and comforter are a bit stiff.  It will take a lot of wear and washing before they get to a comfy softness, and the comforter doesn\'t lay very smoothly.  However, they\'re not stiff to the point of discomfort for my son.  Overall, I\'m happy.",4
Disney Winnie The Pooh Come Out and Play 4-Piece Toddler Set,"The set is really cute. The blanket is ""quilt-like"" but very thin. For this price they should include a throw blanket or something. That would be the only complaint I have... other than that it\'s fine... and also the blanket is reversible. The side not shown in the picture matches the sheet and over-sheet.",4

WallCandy Arts Multi-Color Airplanes &amp; Clouds,We had received a few decorative items that had a vintage transportation theme and these wall stickers just brought everything together for our toddler\'s room. It was a great way to decorate a blank wall and my husband had fun putting them up.  This product is very easy to use and the only thing you need is your imagination.  People who came to visit thought we had painted them on using stencils!,5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"This product is wonderful! Yes can be a little bit of a pain to open doors even for adults, but it definetly keeps the kids out and that\'s what it was created for! Glad I bought it and don\'t have to replace knobs with locks :-)",5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"Purchased this product to prevent a senior with dementia and alzhiemers from leaving the house and wandering away.  Works like a charm.  Older hands can\'t grasp the knob with this product in-place or figure out the lock tab that keeps them from unlocking doors.  Since it is shaped like a door knob, they don\'t realize that you\'ve put something on the door to keep them in.  I\'m sure it works the same for children and would recommend this product highly.",5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"These fit on my &#34;tulip&#34;-shaped doorknobs, but you cannot open the door with these on, rendering it useless for me.",1
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,The door knob safety covers are made of thin plastic but do the job.  Our little one has been foiled by them and that\'s all you need from a door knob guard.,3
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,they hard for adults to use and therefore impossible for a child to use. one the rubber press broke off. they do fall apart easily so I supposed a persistent child could defeat it by making it fall apart and off the knob,3
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"We used them on several different doorknobs in our house, but once we put the cover on the doorknob, no one could open the door.  The rubberized button things that are supposed to allow you to grip the doorknob are just not rubbery and slip right off.  Fail.",1
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"I purchased this Mommy\'s Helper version plus the Babies R Us ""Safety 1st"" version.  I prefer the Mommy\'s Helper version because it has the rubber grab-tab buttons which makes it easy and thought-free when opening the door.  Basically, you grip the the plastic handle anywhere and you\'re able to squeeze the rubber tabs which will then tighten around the door knob for easy turning.  The Safety 1st version, instead has open holes that you have to stick your fingers into to grab the actual door handle.  Not difficult, but for the same cost, it\'s quicker & easier to use the Mommy\'s Helper version.",5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,MY DAUGHTER NEEDED SOMETHING TO HELP HER KEEP MY GRANDKIDS FROM GOING OUTSIDE WHEN SHE WAS BUSY. THESE REALLY DID THE JOB. THEY ARE MUCH SAFER NOW. THANK YOU,5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,This does work.  It keeps my 3 year old from getting out.  But locking and unlocking the door can be a hassle.  And I think after a while he will figure out how to take it off the knob anyway.  Worth the price and would recommend but like a lot of these things not perfect.  Since he was going outside by himself the extra hassle with these is worth it though.  His safety is our biggest priority.,5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,I have a standard Kwikset knob... I felt like the damn thing was a jigsaw puzzle and someone was taunting me from outside... It took a screwdrive to pry the damn thing off just so I could open the door to get out of my house...  I guess it\'s my own fault for being cheap...,1
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"They are easy to install and do their job. The only problem is that they are a little too big for our knobs. But we are satisfied. We tried the American Red Cross too, and honestly, I prefer Mommy\'s Helper big time.",4
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"I was really hoping that these would work.  We have very simple round doorknobs and I was able to get the covers on ok.  The problem is that the covers do not stay.  The fit is tight but if you use them, even moderately, they slide all over.  They slide to the right, to the left, or slide straight back to the point that they are no longer even on the doorknob. This renders them totally useless.  After adjusting them numerous times I threw them away. Don\'t waste your time or money on them.I would rate them ""no stars"" but that choice was not available.",1
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,I have had these on our door and it was working great.  It kept our three year old and his grandparents out of the cupboard so that none of them could go rummaging for snacks.  Unfortunately today marks the day that all of them know how to take the cover off of the handle.  So it works well for children who cannot reach the knob and may work for children who give up easily.  Our determined little boy has conquered the safety cover.,3
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"i read the reviews and basically they may or may not work, depending on your door knob.  so buy one set. if it works, great.  if not, try another model.  these work great on our bathroom door, which is a round, smooth knob but has very thin depth.  it is impossible to use on our other doors where the knob is round, smooth but has thick depth.  it doesn\'t catch the knob so you can\'t open the door and it\'s really hard to take off.  i tried the safety 1st ones on that knobs that are thicker depth and it fits perfectly and we can open the door.  however, i think the safety 1st ones will be easy for my toddler to figure out.  only time will tell.",4
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,My toddler figured out how this worked and came off in minutes. It definitely would not keep her out of somewhere she wanted to go!,1
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"i didn\'t realize how necessary these were until our boy could open doors. these make it so even the smartest tot can\'t figure these out and keeps em contained in one area. get extras to take on trips for hotels, grammas, etc...",5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"Although my 78-year-old mom has some trouble working the doorknobs, they definitely do the job! Keeps the little guy just where we want him.",5
Mommy\'s Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"The price is right, but is a little difficult at times for me to open the doors, but I guess that even better when you have 2 toddlers running around, so I am not complaining too much, but I do remove it when they are napping lol!",3
WallCandy Arts Chalkboard Panel Wall Decal Kit,"I bought this for my 3 year old to have in her room and on the go... It works great if you want to be able to peel it off and take it some where with you. Sticks great. Wipes easily with a damp cloth. And saves space, not having it in the way. Works with all types of chalk, but it scratches very easily. My daughter went the wrong way to draw and left a big scratch on it. So if using for small ones, you might want to save one or two back. Just in case the others get too scratched up.Would have gave it a five if it didn\'t scratch so easily.. But works fine for me.. I just saved one or two to use later.",4
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","Finally, I can give my younger son a juice box without having to worry about him squeezing it and getting juice everywhere!  This product is good quality and allows my son to drink juice boxes or bags with minimal worry on my part.  Some juice boxes don\'t fit very well because of their shape, so they may just sit loosely in the holder and kids can easily take them out.  Most fit just fine though and as long as they aren\'t sliding around in the holder, my son doesn\'t try to take them out.  This is nice and sturdy, is easily cleaned, and is easy for little hands to hold.  I would definitely recommend to other parents who have juice box squeezing children at home!",4
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",makes giving my newphews juice boxes so much easier cause they dont squeeze them and then wear them...would buy again and again. they fit everything from regular juice boxes to capri sun even the little juice boxes are safe.,5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","Our 1.5 year old daughter always wants to do everything like big brother, so whenever he has a Capri Sun or juice box, she wants one too.  Of course the first few times she was given one she promptly toddled out of the kitchen, took one sip, and squeezed the pouch, spilling everywhere.Enter the Mommy\'s Helper Juice Box Buddy.  Works perfectly, and now our daughter can be just like big brother.  We\'ve had no problems with it chipping, cracking, or breaking.  It goes right in the dish washer without problems.  Our daughter has dropped or thrown it plenty of times and no damage.We\'ve not had any problem fitting juice boxes into it - though we stick mostly to Capri Sun pouches and Motts for Tots.  Your mileage may vary.  All in all, we\'re very satisfied.  This is a great item to throw into an order to bump you over the free shipping threshold.",5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","Because of the description ""assorted colors"" I was a little surprised when only one showed up.  When I called to verify the quantity was correct, after the phone at Baby\'s Gallerie was answered by a simple hello, no identification, the response to my question was ""for $2.97?"" I was only asking a question not looking to be insulted.  The plastic is thin and only fits the small juice boxes and not juice pouches.  Too bad it was only $2.97 because it wasn\'t worth shipping back for a refund.",1
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",These are so handy...bought 2 for my 3.5 yr old and 2 year old.  I got tired of sippy cups.  Now I can keep juice boxes in my car and have something for the kids to drink all the time.The holders work perfectly and prevent squirting.,5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","I have a 3 year old and a 16 month old.  This is perfect for both of them.  Some of the other reviews made me wonder if this would work, but in my opinion it works fine.  The juice bags fit perfectly!  My youngest is still drinking the smaller Mots for Tots size boxes, and yes, they move around a bit.  But my little guy sucks his juice down so fast that he doesn\'t hang onto it long enough for it to be an issue.  I usually only give them juice boxes/bags when we travel, so to be able to hand back a box while we are in the car, and not have to worry about spills, has been a lifesaver.  If you are having an issue with the smaller boxes moving around, I think this problem could easily be solved by just stuffing a paper towel or napkin inside to fill in the extra space.  I just saw these at my local Giant food store in the baby food section but they were selling them for at least a dollar more.  This is a product that every mother should have in her arsenal.",5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","Like others, I expected to get three juice box holders. I was surprised to only get one in my order when there was no mention of quantity, only the picture to show what you were ordering. I kept the juice box holder, because honestly, it does work great. My two-year-old has had zero spills or accidental squeezes when using his holder. I would recommend the product, but be aware of the quantity issue.",2
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",this item is a must-have on my list!  No more spilled sticky juice all over.  I can give my toddler a juice box and not worry about having spills and melt-downs!  I love these and will use them until my kids are well old enough to handle a juice box on their own with no spills!,5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","This product worked well for tightly fitted juice boxes, but not for pouches.  I bought two of these for my 2 year old twins and if I put in a juice pouch they would just take it out and still squeeze it out everywhere.",3
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","This box stopped my daughter from squeezing juice all over her face, clothes, and the floor. However, there does need to be some form of supervision as the child can just pull the juice box or bag out of the container. would be great if it had a top. somehow. Other than this, no complaints. Dishwasher safe & BPA free a huge plus.",4
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","Absolutely love the product. Never had these for my 4 year old, because she is very careful and tidy. But my 2 year old boy? VERY GLAD TO HAVE IT FOR HIM!! I was shocked the package only had ONE holder, but he can only drink on juice at a time, so it\'s all good. I just figured I\'d let everyone else know...read the fine print! 5 star for product. 1 star for deceptive photo. Average: 3 star",3
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",It can hold large or small juice boxes. Very easy to clean and wash. Good price and deal. Recommend it.,5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",These little juice box holders do the job but the picture is super deceiving. Please update the picture to reflect the fact that you only get one. Read description carefully.,2
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","East to hold, it\'s thick and sturdy but I wish there was something that prevents the juice package from coming out...",3
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","Great little juice container for the price, but wish it had something to actually keep the juice box IN it! My 20 month old takes it out about 1 minute after beginning to drink. Needless to say, very rarely does juice stay &#34;contained&#34;.",3
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",I purchased 2 of these last week and even at $2.00 each I paid too much for them.  The plastic chips very easily and the design is very plain.  It certainly did not fit many different types of juices.  The really small juices fit but rattle around in there.  The Motts juices don\'t fit in there.  And even juice pouches are a tight fit.,1
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",This product works great for my 20 month old. Fits almost all juice boxes. Easy to clean. This is perfect for toddlers who have just started drinking juice boxes!,5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",Great device when you have a child prone to squeezing juice boxes. Only down side was that it really only fits larger juice boxes.,4
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","I\'ve tried several different juice box holders, and these are by far the best. Other boxes (including Dwink and Thomas The Tank Engine) do not fit all box sizes, and/or have pliable sides (that allow squeezing the contents). ""Juice Box Buddies"" fit most box sizes, and are rigid enough to keep liquid from being squeezed out. These are the only juice box holders I would recommend.",5
Fisher-Price Stand and Ride Duo Stroller,"We have a 20 month old and a 4 year old.  My 4 year old has been stroller resistant from day one.  Obviously, if we cannot keep her controlled, shopping and errands are impossible.  While this stroller looked HUGE in the store, I really liked how maneuverable it was for us.  Even in a crowded department store, I am easily able to move around racks and through narrow aisles.  Both of the children like it--a REAL plus is that my 4year old can sit facing me and have a conversation.  When she gets really \'antsy\' she can stand safely.  I like that there is a real foot tray which eliminates toddlers dragging their feet on the wheels. (NOW, THAT\'S unmaneuverable!)I think the top basket is probably a waste of space and energy. I cannot see myself bothering with it.  The bottom basket is hard to get to--but it is large.If you are tall--you will really enjoy the height of the handle which has two cup holders.  For our situation, this is a great stroller.  It\'s not small--but it definitely solves a number of problems for us.",4
Fisher-Price Stand and Ride Duo Stroller,I have a 3yr and 1tr old and this is the best double stroller by far.. I read the reviews for the baby trend and the Jovvy and I even went to the stores and looked at the other 2.. It is a heavy stroller but it is built to last.. LOVE it and so do the kids!,5
Fisher-Price Stand and Ride Duo Stroller,Excellent stroller for the stand and ride option.  Fanstastic for ride and storage option also.  Well built.  You will not have to worry about this breaking.  Easy to collapse and store.  Best stand and ride out there.,5
Fisher-Price Stand and Ride Duo Stroller,"I have read reviews on TONS of strollers. I have had a ton of strollers, 13 to be exact. I have looked for a Sit and Stand other than the Baby Trends and Joovy ones for months. I happened to read the Big Lots circular and found the Fisher Price one. I have a 2 yr old that weighs 36lbs and a 4 month old still in her infant carrier. I went to the web to read the reviews. It was put out in 2006 and discontinued in 2007. They were just not a big seller. There was no recall, contrary to what some poster said. The main complaints were that it was bulky. Well, what two person stroller is not. I like that it has high handles, so the 5\'9"" mom does not have to stoop. Its handle is back far enough that you are not kicking the standing ledge. It turns on a dime. The stroller folds incredibly compact for essentially a tandem stroller. The storage basket when there is one child is phenomenal, what a creative use for the space! It has cup holders for the parents and the snack tray for the child. I also really like the idea that my stroller does not look like everyone else\'s when we go somewhere. They were just advertised and sent to Big Lots this week. It was only $99 also.",5
Fisher-Price Stand and Ride Duo Stroller,"We have been shopping diligently for a functional stroller for my three year old and baby #2.  The side by side models were too crowded for my three year old and the tandems were too bulky for my small SUV.  The sit and stand seemed to be our best bet, but when we went looking we were really disappointed in the sturdiness/quality of the models we saw (i.e. Joovy and Baby Trend).  We found the Joovy model very difficult to manuever even with one child in it, and we found the Baby Trend model to be flimsy and easily tipped.  We found the Peg Perego P3 with the toddler step very appealing except for the price, which in our area runs in the $[...] range. I want quality, but I also want to be reasonable. We happened on the FP model and couldn\'t be happier.  It is bulky as are all strollers of this type, yet less so than a full tandem.  However, it has a sturdy design, and manuevers with much less difficulty than the Joovy.  The cargo basket is much more accessible than all of the other models we looked at.  And while my 3 year old can only stand when the car seat is in the stroller, I found that to be true of all of the other models as well.  I like the design of the rear seat; it is much more stable, wider, and doesn\'t slide back and forth (decreases the risk of pinched fingers.  I like the extra safety straps for the car seat as well. The extra cargo basket is only useful when you have one child in the stroller, but then it frees up hands to share with the toddler when she chooses to walk along side.I would recommend this stroller.",5
Milk Bands Nursing Bracelet PINK QTY: 1,"I bought this item to remember which breast I had nursed off last. The white bands that came along with it I never used and they still ended up breaking after maybe a week or two of wear. As for the glow in the dark feature, you can\'t read what the bracelet says in the dark.",4
Milk Bands Nursing Bracelet PINK QTY: 1,"I thought this was a great idea and put it on the day before my due date.  I wanted to already have it on so I would remember to start using it right away in the hospital.  One week later my baby has yet to arrive but my bracelet is already broken.  One of the white pieces fell off and two broke off.  It doesn\'t seem like it would be that difficult to make sturdy enough pieces, I wish this company would have gotten it right.",1
Milk Bands Nursing Bracelet PINK QTY: 1,This bracelet is a wonderful idea but actual product is worthless. I purchased two bracelets and in less than two weeks 3 of the 4 sliders that you move up and down to mark the time had broken. There was no way to fix them.,1
Milk Bands Nursing Bracelet PINK QTY: 1,"I liked this at first but as I kept using it I found it tedious and it irritated my skin, the brackets to keep track broke very easily too. I wouldn\'t recommend this.",2
Milk Bands Breastfeeding Reminder Bracelet - Lilac,"Great product, but all of the sliders broke within the first week of use rendering this product useless. Don\'t waste your money.After this one broke, I bought this -> http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Minder-1029-Bracelet-Pink/dp/B0028K30AC/ as a replacement. It lasted longer, but looks and feels clunkier. :(",1
Milk Bands Breastfeeding Reminder Bracelet - Lilac,"I like this bracelet as I used it for my last baby, just a warning that the white clips were easily lost but once you have nursing down they really dont matter, its nice to know which side to start on for the next session. a comfortable little bracelet would work too to switch from wrist to wrist if you prefer something more adult looking.",4
Milk Bands Breastfeeding Reminder Bracelet - Lilac,"Yet another product I thought I ""needed"".  It was difficult to remember which side I had last breastfed, but once you get the hang of it, you can tell which breast is fuller.  My son (13 months) just found this bracelet and thought the tiny plastic sliders would be fun to eat.  This is not a safe product to have around babies and they should create a better way to secure the plastic sliders to the bracelet.  There has to be a better way to remember which side you last fed, without it being a choking hazard.",1
Milk Bands Breastfeeding Reminder Bracelet - Lilac,"I initially wrote an ""excellent"" review for this item.  When I first got it, it was great and did exactly what I wanted.  The plastic pieces for keeping track of time last fed were great, and my favorite feature was that you just flip the bracelet inside out for ""Right"" or ""Left,"" instead of switching wrists all the time, which helps to not stretch out the bracelet as much from taking it on and off.After I already purchased the bracelet, I read alot of reviews saying the plastic pieces break anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after first using it.  Mine lasted about one week.  I\'m super disappointed, because I really loved this bracelet.  Now I will probably look to buying a different bracelet that isn\'t so poorly designed.  Others have said you can order more pieces from the manufacturer, but you have to pay shipping.  But that is just buying me another week or two per piece, it\'s not worth it.Great idea for a product, but poor quality.",3
Milk Bands Breastfeeding Reminder Bracelet - Lilac,"I received a Milk Band in 2008 before the birth of my daughter.  It was one of the most useful shower gifts I received!  I wore it constantly for 6 months and had no issues with the white tabs breaking.  I purchased a new Milk Band this spring as I was expecting my second child and my first Milk Band was a little discolored from the constant wear in 2009.  My son is only 8 weeks old and already all 4 of the tabs that came with it have broken!  I\'m not sure why they changed the quality, but I am sorely disappointed.  Right now I have moved the tabs from my original bracelet onto this new one, so we\'ll see how long they last.  I am very disappointed in the change in this product and hope they will go back to manufacturing them to last!",3
Milk Bands Breastfeeding Reminder Bracelet - Lilac,"i love the idea of this band! it\'s great to be able to keep track of which side i started nursing on last time and what time the feeding was. it was great for the first few weeks since i couldn\'t keep track of anything at all in my fried mommy brain. however, within a few weeks the sliders that you use to keep track of the time broke. i ordered some new ones from milk bands which were free, but had to pay $3 for shipping! after using the new sliders for just a short period of time - less than 2 weeks - they also broke. i went through 3 sets of sliders in less than 2 months. i still use it to keep track of which side i nurse on but have given up on the time-keeping part of it. so, overall the idea behind the bracelet is great, but they need to come up with a better, longer-lasting design.",3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Swaddle, Cowboy","It was after I had my first child that I learned about the sleep sack. I called it a zipped up blanket. A friend from our church offered to give me hers for my baby. I was so excited when I got it, because it lessened the anxiety of wondering if my baby is overdress for the winter or under dressed for the summer nights.When I had my second child. I was already prepared with this very same sleep sack! It is such a relief to know your child is comfortable as they sleep.As a parent or child care giver you know that children don\'t keep their blankets on so the sleepsack is perfect in that it\'s a blanket and you can put it on your child. There are even some with the legs for older children!These blankets are soft and roomy and you can choose from preemie up to 5t! I was very excited to learn of the various sizes!Using the sleepsack will help create a safer sleep environment for your child. Especially for newborns under the risk of SIDS.I\'m so glad I found this product and I would recommend it to every parent with children. This also makes a wonderful gift for a new mother!",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small",Great product! This product is well made and is extremely comfortable.  Would purchase more in different colors. Washes up beautifully!!!,5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small","The bag is pretty soft and light. The material seems good quality. The zipper has a cloth backing to not bother your child\'s skin, however, it stops short of cover the start of the zipper by your child\'s chin. The metal part has some relatively sharp and uncomfortable edge. I wish Halo stepped it up and made a cover for that part like the Grobag.",3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small",Definitely worth getting the Organic Cotton. Safer for baby and so much softer! The size it great. It will fit my baby for a long time.,5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small","HALO sleep sacks are fantastic. The price is a little higher for the organic version, but it is reflected in the quality of the fabric. The zipper works well and our daughter loves it. It is easy to take off and on for changing and easily fits over her pajamas. It seems to keep the baby warm, without being too warm and looks great. We own several different HALO sacks and definitely recommend them.",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small","As other reviews have stated maybe not as soft as a baby lamb but baby loves it and sleeps well. Thin cotton and an easy zipper, buying another!",5

"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small","It\'s nice, but no where does it mention that it\'s .5 TOG. I thought I was buying 1 TOG. Our nursery isn\'t warm enough to warrant a .5 TOG bag, so this is kinda useless.",2
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small","Our baby was able to bust out of a swaddle early on, even with the special velcro-ing (is that a verb?) blankets like the Kiddopotamus & Co.

"Gerber 4 Count Flannel Burp/Diaper Print, Blue",These burp cloths have saved many shirts and tops from being soiled by spitups and throwups. It is thick and covers the shoulder properly. It stays absorbent after numerous washes. Highly recommend.,5

"Gerber 4 Count Flannel Burp/Diaper Print, Blue","These are great for burp rags. They are thick soft material and big in size.  The patterns are cute as well for a girl, although that isn\'t as important for burp rags. Haha.",5
"Gerber 4 Count Flannel Burp/Diaper Print, Blue","These Gerber cloths may not be the thickest around, but they are more than adequate, and the absorbency is great.

Sanrio Hello Kitty Diaper Bag / Baby Tote bag,"This is not a pratical bag for carrying around things you will need for your infant. The zipper broke after we used it it for three days. It is not durable and there are not enough storage compartments. It is cheaply made.  Unfortunately we were not able to find a good quality ""Hello Kitty"" diaper bag so we bought an Eddie Bower diaper bag. So far the only complaint we have with that bag is that the lining tore within the first week we had it. However, that was just an outside pocket. The inner lining is still intact and it has plenty of storage space.",1
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"The adhesive isn\'t the best on this product, but it\'s easy enough to replace the adhesive strips with some other product like command strips.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,Got them up and everything is great now. Definitely recommend them to others are looking for something similar. Saved my head also.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"The cushions seem to be padded well enough to do what they\'re supposed to do. The tape that came in the package is a joke though, I\'m not even sure it\'s double sided. I used some we had left from a package of Prince Lionheart padding (which is great, by the way) and got it to stick firmly. Not sure I would buy this brand again.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"They are smaller, which was fine for us, but the adhesive does not last long.  I ended up buying the thick double sided tape.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"It\'s hard for me to get excited about corner cushions, but they serve their purpose, were a good price, and were easy to &#34;install,&#34; just remove the plastic backing and stick to the corner.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"These bumpers are exactly as I expected - except they came with 12 pieces of tape, not 16. I mean, it could just be me, but my 9 month old will stick his pointy little fingers under anything and rip it off in seconds, so it made sense to me to put a piece of tape on each face of the corner when I stuck it on. (Both legs of the top, and both legs of the side.) But I guess I had to pick - did I want to do 3 faces of all four corners? Or did I only want to do 3 corners? This is an annoying way for the company to ""cut corners"" and save a dime.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I\'ve heard these can be hard to cleanly remove, so maybe purchase Goo Gone as well.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,These work great!  I used them on the corners of our kitchen countertops and island.  Very easy to install.  I highly recommend this product.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,These absolutely did the trick!  My son was just learning to hold himself up and kept hitting his head on the corner of our table.  These saved his poor little noggin!,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,Great product.  Covers and pads the sharp corners of furniture so I don\'t gash myself by accident.  Wish someone would make clear ones for the bathroom mirrored medicine cabinet.  Very sharp corners.  Several cuts from them.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I have only had these on my furniture for a couple of days now, so it\'s hard to tell how durable these kushions are going to be (especially since my 14 month old is already beginning to tug on them).Pros:1. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn\'t find the size to be too small.2. Being black in color, they blend well into my dark furniture.3. The padding seems adequate for protecting against any injury due to bumpsCons:Tape, tape and tape1. As most reviewers have pointed out, why not just provide 16 pieces instead of 12?! It\'s absurd! I used the 3M double-sided tape to make up for the missing strips2. Once I stuck the tape onto the foam, I found it incredibly hard to peel off the paper to expose the other sticky side. There were quite a few strips where the entire paper wouldn\'t peel off, but would leave a thin layer of paper on top of the tape, rendering the strip useless.The kushions seem to be staying put so far. Despite the tape issues, I\'m pretty happy with the purchase.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,Our Kushions are secured with black electrical tape running around the entire parameter of the table/coffee table/etc. Not a pretty site but I have seen my son bounce off these soft edges several times now without even a wimper!! They do protect him. After his first encounter with a coffee table corner resulting in a large goose-egg  on his forehead; I\'ll take safe vs style ANY day!,4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,These are good for cushioning the blow on the corners however the tape to hold them on is not string enought my 10 month old granddaughter was able to pull them off,2

Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"The instructions were easy enough to follow and I followed them to a ""t"" but they are still able to be pulled off by my 12 month old.  I have a similar type of product on my fireplace made by Prince Lionhart that has not budged even with tons of pulling.  The only reason I didn\'t get that again was because they didn\'t have it in black.  I think next time I\'ll get the non matching color so at least it will stay put.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,These provide planty of cushion for a short fall.  They stay on tight and have actually served as something easier for my daughter to hold on to while making her way around the table.  The black makes them look much less tacky.  We barely notice they are there.  Better than most I\'ve seen.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"It\'s ridiculous that a company that sells you something that needs to be ""stuck"" on something else completely cheaps out on the 2-sided sticky pads. But they did. Good luck trying to get the paper back off the 2-sided tape. If you have your own, then you\'re set. If you have to rely on this company who are clearly cheapskates, then forget them.",3

Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"The foam seems think and soft, and better than felt pads.However, the included double-sided tape is very thin and the backing is very difficult to remove. If you become impatient easily, don\'t buy this unless you can be sure the included tape is more like the double-side foam tape you can buy at hardware stores and home centers. I spent almost 15 mins. removing the backing from the &#34;other&#34; side after sticking the tape to the cushion.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,These are perfect for our table with sharp corners! We don\'t worry she will break her head open on a corner anymore. The tape was really hard to get off though and apply.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I\'ll start with the pros. This is very soft, durable, and protects the kids reasonably well. The con is that my kid ripped them off by the time she could walk and keep herself steady on her feet. Why? Because its the age when they are teething and she loves chewing on them. Mine all have bitemarks. The adhesive would ordinarily work just fine, but if your kid is determined to take them off - they\'re coming off. And if you use something stronger, you\'ll damage the finish on your furniture.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,I wish they sell them in more brown tones. They do the trick but they don\'t match the color of my coffee table.,4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"Well....I was hoping that these would be sufficient for my 9 month old to keep from bumping her forehead on the corners of our end tables.  They are not.  They provide you with 3 pieces of double sided tape for each corner.  Really should be 4 and a much stronger adhesive.  I followed the instructions to the letter, wiped off both the end tables and the foam corners with rubbing alcohol as instructed.  Within an hour of putting them on, my kiddo simply pulled them off.  They were practically falling off on their own accord, no matter how hard I pushed to try and get the adhesive tape to stick.  Complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY",1
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"The cushions themselves are fine but the adhesive that comes with them is totally worthless.  We couldn\'t even get the adhesive strips off the paper backing.  Even if we could have, there are not enough strips anyway.  I contacted the company who makes them and received no response back.  These are nice cushions for the price but be prepared to find your own adhesive.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I purchased these cushions almost 4 years ago for my coffee table and to put on the corners of my kitchen island. The adhesive has worked great for us. It has been picked at and pried at by many many many little fingers and is still there!  The corner guards on the underside of the kitchen island finally came off after 3 years of lots of repeated picking (and my 4 year old almost immediately bumped his head on the bare corner and required a stitch!). I have tried every other kind of double sided tape to re-adhere them, but they will not stay put.  Although the adhesive that comes with the product may be difficult to work with initially, it has great staying power compared to other products. I have just ordered a new set of these to get a fresh set with new adhesive. It\'s a lot cheaper than the emergency room!!! Also it is one of the only options to safeguard the corners on something like a kitchen island.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"These seem to provide enough cushion on the corners of my furniture. They stick well so far, but have not been tested by my baby yet. They blend in really well with the black finish on the cabinet. Easy to apply.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,These are the cheapest way to ensure your child does not get really hurt when they fall or run into the furniture corners.,4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,These are inexpensive and easy to apply.  I was so happy to find an option that came in a variety of colors so that I could match the table.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"Wish it was a little more secure. My son can easily remove it from the corners. If it stays there, it\'s great as it is very soft and the size is good.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"The covers themselves are great, but the two sided tape is difficult to peel, making several of the precut pieces of tape useless. I will end up buying separate two sided tape to use with the corner covers I purchased",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"This product works. We tried a few different protectors when we felt that our little one might be walking soon. A day before she turned a year old, she was cruising away from supporting walls and couch. That when the other corner covers failed us. One was too hard, the other didn\'t stay on. The Kidkusion is the only one that provides the cushion-y protection, and the double sided tape is strong enough to keep the corners on. The only downside we had with this product was the tape that came with it was so hard to peel off. It took my husband and I almost an hour to cover 10 corners, and we both familiar with using double sided tape.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,I got these bumpers to put on the edges of some sharp woodwork I have.  I received the bumpers but no adhesive of any type is included with the bumpers so you can\'t attach them to anything.  They are useless without adhesive.,1
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I purchased these to protect an entertainment center I have set up in my media room. They definitely cushion the corners, however the adhesive tape is difficult to apply. Also, I found that my 18 month old was drawn to them, and repeatedly attempts to rip them off (with some success). Be prepared to apply your own double-sided tape down the road.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"These are great corner cushions... again, like the edge padding not too big nor bulky ... great to protect my toddler from getting hurt on any corner I can get it to stick on.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,As a lot of reviews said the tape given with product does not work.....I went straight to the hot glue gun and no problems now!,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"Too easy to pull off, which happened all the time.  Had to get rid of the TV stand and mount the TV to the wall, which is so much better anyway.  Maybe there is a way to make it more permanent and harder to pull off, but it really did not work for us.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"Confession time:  IALWAYS cut the corner too tightly near my king size bed and end up with horrible bruises on my calf.....So I put these on the 2 lower corners, and &#34;voila&#34;!!  no more bruises!  Bet they are great for toddlers too...",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,It is not only bad quality but the adhesive is of a such poor quality that it keeps on falling....:(,1
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I used these on a plastic speaker with sharp edges.  Some of the adhesive stuck, but a couple of the corners did not.  To be fair, I did not clean the sufaces with rubbing alcohol before applying them as the instructions indicated.  There was also a sharp ridge on top of each corner that came to a point, so I had to file that down with a nail file to make it smoother.",2
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"Good concept, bad adhesive. My son pulled these all off the coffee table within a couple of weeks.",1
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"This product is exactly as shown in the picture.  I am a little disappointed that the only way to affix the cushion corners are with cheesy little stickers (small, square adhesive squares).",3
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"It was a little difficult to get the backing off the sticky pieces that came to attach it to the table.  Other than that, it seems to be working just fine.  Our dining area is high traffic and the corners of the table are right at our child\'s eye level.  So far they have stayed in place and prevented her from hitting her head.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I looked for similar corner guards for some time and these fit, look, and work perfectly.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"Made of urethane type foam of sufficient density to protect against colliisions, this corner guard was easy to install and stays in place.  Recommended.The appearance would be improved by molding the outer edges rather than cutting, but this is minor.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I got this for myself (a full-grown adult) to protect my elbow from a corner of my night stand that I seem unfortunately drawn to smash when sitting up or stretching in bed. It\'s squishy and so comfortable, I not only no longer need to avoid that corner, I can actually rest my elbow on it as an arm cushion while reading! I love that there was a black option, which blends in almost seamlessly with my table. I don\'t know how well it would hold up to kids, but since I\'m not messing with it, I\'m thrilled!",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"Meh. There is no way that the tape they sent with two of mine was double sided. That was a headache.  You will be better off using your own anyway since the limited three pieces are not enough. Other than that, they should get the job done.",2
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"They are low quality, very, very small and fall off way too easy!! They stayed on for only 2 days.",2
Tinkle Targets 15 Pack - Sports,"Grandsons had fun with them...as long as they were being watched. 3 and 4 years of age and decided to both try to hit the target at the same time. Made a bit of a mess that took Grandma some time to disinfect.I can see how these are wonderful and they do teach little ones to try to be careful. I put on in for my husband one evening...hoping he\'d get the hint. He was amused and admitted to having some fun...at 67 years of age. I guess it\'s not just for little kids!I tried the ones that attach to inside of the bowl and they did not work at all. Those made of tissue paper can easily be made at home for a lot less money.I do recommend these, but know you what you are getting. One reviewer said the get expensive if you flush them...I agree 100%.",4
KidCoddler Child Head Support System in Grape Purple,The Picture is very misleading. It doesn\'t work the way it looks.  Don\'t waste your money. That\'s really all there is to say.,1
Travel Vest Large,"I had bought a different sort of fold-up seat with 5-point restraints in 2007 for my now 6 year-old to use when we travelled.  That product is no longer available, and this is all we could find.  I have an Outback wagon, 1 kid in a booster and 1 in a convertible seat.  I was looking for that extra ""seat"" to have when we need to transport a 3rd kid (in lieu of buying a mini-van!).It does serve that purpose, but my son complained about wearing it in the summer (and on vacation in FL), because it covers his whole chest and is hot.  Also, I thought it was overpriced, but it is cheaper than another car (and fits better than any other combination of seats I tried).",3
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Exactly what you need for kid\'s safety. It thicks well even on glass, has good cushion (I added spots of contact-cement every 5 inches on the inside, only to ensure longer lasting stick).",5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I like it because it protects without being ugly. I had to use wider two sided tape however.  Good buy.,4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I bought these because they were the perfect brown Colorado I needed to match my fireplace but the same day I put them off my daughter pulled them off. Once I replace the tape with a much stronger double sided sticky tapethey started to pull away from the tape itself.,1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I got this for my fireplace hearth before realizing that it wasn\'t labeled for that. Oops. I put it on anyway. It sticks great and it hasn\'t melted or anything. We use our wood stove all winter to heat the house and I haven\'t had any trouble.,4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"I liked it, the only problem I saw is the way you have to stick it, Im not sure that the sticky patches last a long time",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,Decent cushion. I wish the tape supplied was long enough for both lips of the cushion (I think it is only long enough for one lip).,4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Great cushion, but they don\'t provide you with enough double-sided tape to use all 12 feet of it.  The color blends in well with wood furniture.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"adhesive tape not enough , It only can adhesive to one side , I do no understand how do they sell that",1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"This is an excellent product. Everyone that comes to my house says, ""What a great idea!"" I have a 9 month old girl and  have no fear that she is going to get hurt with the fireplace. Some reviews mention problems with the tape. The way to do is: First stick the tape to the edge of the fireplace. Then peel the tape. Finally, put the foam on top. It doesn\'t come off.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,There was not enough adhesive. Didn\'t come with instructions (which I was ok with cause pretty self explanatory) but since I ran out of adhesive I\'m wondering if I was suppose to only do segments and not whole strips.,2
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,Great for the fire place. My fire place curves at the edges so I could not get the more ridged cushion. A lot of people have complemented how nice it looks. Note I placed this on a brick fireplace and it stayed in place fine. Its been up for about a month now.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"The foam was in brand new condition but the tape that is ""suppose to"" fasten it to any surface is a waste of money. After having it on our coffee table (which is glass) for only a week, the tape lost it\'s tackiness and the foam started falling off. I had to secure the foam to the table with packaging tape, which now looks even worse than the foam alone. When shopping for this product, please choose a different brand.",2
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Bought 3 of this in different color to match my furniture. Perfect for baby-proofing the sharp edges of my coffee table and other teakwood furniture. The color blends well, so it doesn\'t look like an add-on. However, Amazon packed it in a box, much larger than necessary with some air packs for protection, which made delivery much more expensive.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I got this to use on my desk. My desk has sharp edges and I spend a lot of time  on the computer so after a while the edges of the desk start digging into my forearms. This stuff fixed it! It is easy to install and sticks very well! I was worried that it would be falling off in a few days but the adhesive they use is great! Looks factory installed too!,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Bought this to wrap around a drafting table that had bare wood edges so that resting my wrists/arm on the desk felt more comfortable. Really glad I bought this! It has withstood a few weeks of being on the desk, though for this relatively intensive contact I\'d use a continuous strip of double-stick tape along the edge where I\'m resting my arms instead of patches of tape as recommended by the installation instructions.This cushioning probably won\'t withstand kids tearing at it, but for the purpose of protecting from bumps on corners, it would work well I\'m sure. I think the other negative reviews are a bit unreasonable - this is cushioning designed to be removable from furniture, so the double-stick tape won\'t last forever and may need to be replaced at some point a year or two down the line. You can\'t expect too much from tape glue! It has stayed on perfectly well on my desk though, and the cushioning is very high quality and soft.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"I do not have a child, but I used it on my table for a different purpose. I\'ve had it on my table for 4 months, and it\'s slowly starting to come off. I basically use the foam to rest my arms because the edge of the table was sharp and left marks on my forearm. 4 months of resting my forearm without pulling, or trying to rip off the foam has caused it to slowly come off. It\'s a great cushion for the edge of the table, but you can probably get something better to make it stay on the table.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"It\'s a great product, but where is the adhesive tape? I don\'t believe the description indicated it that it didn\'t come with one... Thankfully I ordered this product together with the Prince Lionheart\'s bundle, and I was able to use the adhesive from that package on both products...",3
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I ordered the Kidkusion Todler Edge to wrap around the metal frame of my coffee table. It has worked fabulously and my crawling baby is no longer injuring herself as she explores the living room. It also blends in perfectly and was easy to install. I only wish the product sold in larger increments. I could have wrapped my whole house in this stuff!,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"These bumpers are nice, and they come with a roll of tape. But you\'ll find the roll of tape is about 6 feet shorter than the roll of bumper - at least if you want to tape the top and the side down. I don\'t know of any children that wouldn\'t pull it off if you didn\'t. So now we have a coffee table that is protected on 2 sides. Great. Fortunately he hasn\'t figured how to walk all the way around it yet. So I guess I\'ve got a day or two to find some more double sided tape.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"The Kushions is ok, The problem is that the glue on the tape did not come off with the tape upon removable, The sticky glue was very difficult to remove from both a metal table and a wood table, and also they should have offer more tape, the size of the tape is ridiculous it\'s not enough to install all kushions.",2
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"This item cannot be used on brick fireplaces!!!  No where on the item description does it mention this.  It does however state it very clearly on the instruction page once you have already purchased it and received it in the mail.  Not wanting to wait for return/new purchase I figured I would give it a try and it in fact does not stick well to brick.  It is already cut so I don\'t think it can be returned.  I gave it two stars because I am sure it works well on solid surfaces, but I wish this was made clear in the item description.",2
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"The Foam Edge Krushing is fine. Unfortunately,the tape came with this product is too narrow (1/2\') and it would not come off the backing after I place the tape on the Toddler Kushion as instructed.  The backing of the tape just would not come off no matter how hard I tried.  To make this product work, I had to go to a home improvement Center and purchase a roll of double sticky tape (3/4\' 3M mounting tape).  Don\'t buy this product unless you are willing to purchase a high quality 3M mounting tape.",1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"These cushions are amazing!  If you are careful when installing then, they are hardly visible on chocolate brown/black surfaces, and they also look nice on glass surfaces.  Because they are on a roll, however, they are a bit annoying to put on straight edges and you may need to adjust them a few times to get it straight... but once mounted, they look really good. Other brands make straight-edge cushions, but I found that the pre-cut lengths were rarely the lengths I actually needed, and in my opinion, having multiple ""puzzle pieces"" on one edge was less appealing than spending some extra time to get the rolled cushion to be straight.Net net, I would definitely recommend these -- even for straight edges. Just don\'t forget to get the matching corner pieces as well!",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I followed the directions and used rubbing alcohol to help the material adhere better. A few days in and it has held up against a very curious 6 mo old.,4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"The product looks great on my table. However, the first day it was up my daughter pulled off bumpers. Would not recommend anyone purchasing, waste of money.",1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,My main complaint is that it is 3 inches short for my coffee table.  I also wish it had stronger adhesive as my 1.5 year old son keeps pulling it off.,3
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Its a good product other then its an ugly color! I ordered this before realizing that it came in black also. So I have both on my living room furnature.Again it didnt come with enough tape, i guess you can buy more seperate. easy to install and can cut to any size.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Although its a good price, its very cheap and after a few days starts to detach from the double sided tape. I tried it on both corners and very long stretches of glass and wood on an entertainment stand. It came loose everywhere a few days later even after following the directions on how to properly attach it. I know it seems more expensive but I suggest just investing in the edge covers and shorter straight covers from places like babies r us. Its not worth the hassle of trying to make this work and the very hard time you will have removing double sided tape.",1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,Followed the instructions perfectly and it was even on a smooth glass surface but my son was still able to pull it loose.  The two sided tape came loose from the cushion and is left stuck to the glass surface.  I haven\'t tried to remove the tape yet so I\'m not sure how easily it will come off.  Go with the Prince Lionhart brand.  The cushion on the stone on my fireplace is stuck nice and tight even through tons of pulling and chewing.  I wish they offered a black color with Prince Lionhart.,2
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Product is very thick - perfect to protect the baby.  However, KIDKUSION cheated on the tape and length.TAPE:  There isn\'t enough.  They only give you enough to put a piece every 8"" or so.  After about 10 hours to cure the tape the baby reached for the edge and the cushion separated from the table where there was no tape.  The taped spots did hold but what good is it having just 1"" every 9"" stick to the surface???> KIDKUSION should have provided enough to run the entire length of the table.LENGTH:  Description says 12 feet long.  No way!  It did HALF the table - package consists of about 6-7 feet max.I bought a similar product for the table corners thinking the corners were all I needed to cover.  The corners came from Amazon: Safety 1st Corner Edge.  Excellent product with much better tape.  Unfortunately for me, they did not have the taupe color in the roll so I moved over to KIDKUSION.If you buy the product it will do what it is designed to do but save yourself the trouble and while waiting for it to arrive, take a trip to Home Depot or Loew\'s for a roll of pressure sensitive foam tape.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Works great on my round glass table.  I wish my son wouldn\'t find the edge and lift it up, but other than that, it works great.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,The foam is great and has saved our boys from more than a couple bumps on corners.  The adhesive isn\'t as good as the foam and it tends to loose adhesion with the foam over time.  It does not loose adhesion to hard surfaces though and will tear the paint and finish right off of wood.You need to weigh the good with the bad.  It will save the little ones from some potentially nasty bumps at the price of a little touch up paint.,4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"We have a bed with drawers underneath it, so we have to watch out for the sides of it. as well as our other furniture in the bedroom we put that edge guard on it. it helped me more out then our little one, when on more then one time i have stubbed my toe on it. yet the sticky tape is were it falls short on, worthless stuff!",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"As many other negative reviews say, the foam part is great, but they do not provide enough tape with this product. There is only enough to cover one edge of the foam if you are using all the foam, and anyone with a baby/toddler knows, they will pull up anything they can get their fingers under. If it is being used as provided by only adults, the product works great. More tape is needed if you are using it for child proofing. Weigh the cost of what it will take to buy more double sided tape with the cost difference of a more expensive product.",3
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,Its just a piece of rubber.  They include single sided tape instead of double sided? We had to make an extra trip to home depot to buy double sided tape so the rubber will attach to the edge.,1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"We cut this long strip up and used it to trim our TV console.  Days before, my son fell into it and got an enormous bruise right in the center of his forehead...  not so, now.  He\'s bumped into it several times and hasn\'t even cried.  It does its job and he can\'t pull it off.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"This stuff is SO expensive, and barely covers anything.  AND the adhesive sucks.  i guess that\'s why it won\'t ruin your furniture.  however, your baby (and yes- baby, not toddler) will pull it right off. :(  Get another adhesive and it should work better.  but still not happy about the cost for this stuff.  i wish amazon used styrofoam peanuts to pack their boxes... i would use those to pad corners/edges around the house- in a heart beat!",2
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,Worked great on our coffee table in the living room.  We had enough left over to do the bottom edges as well as the top.  Definitely worth the money.  Stays well.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Yes, as all the other reviewers mentioned, the tape on this does not work well. I just bought a roll of scotch two way tape and fixed it on all corners that my baby gravitates to. It\'s well cushioned and blends in well with my furniture. Cheaper on Amazon than in stores, I recommend it while child proofing your house!",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"I was lured by the lower price and the fact that I could get more legth for the money.  I should have stuck with a more expensive, higher-quality brand.  This tape cushion came off very quickly.  The sticky tape was almost non-existent and, unlike the Prince Lionheart corners (more expensive) that stayed on perfectly and came with double rows of tape, this one barely gave you enough to tape down one of two sides (top but not bottom).The baby only need to give it a few tugs, and it no longer stays on.  I even tried purchasing a clear tape and readjusting it myself, which also didn\'t work.  In the end, I spent more time and almost as much money as I would, had I bought a more expensive version of this item.  If you have a brick fireplace, consider investing in a thicker cushion.",2
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,After my son went to the ER for a cut above his eye from smacking his head on his headboard I ordered this! It blends well with the furniture and now I know he hopefully won\'t get anymore cuts from jumping into bed! It has a good cushion and is nice to work with!,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Used at elementary school to protect tender young noggins.  I just upgraded to stronger, wider 3m adhesive and have saved trips to the nurses\' office :)",5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,This has worked great for a few corners that we were bumping into (forget the toddlers we can\'t even avoid that stupid corner). The tape is thick and installation was a simple application of some double sided tape. After 3 months the bumper is still in its original place so the tape is holding well. I only wish it came in more colors to closer match the furniture it\'s attached to.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"When I went to apply the cushions to my furniture, I ran out of tape with about a third of the roll left. The instructions say to only put tape on one side. Um, no. Even when I put tape on both sides, the cushions are still coming off. Plus, my 11 month old just crawls over and rips them right off. :/ The other brand of cushion is much better.",1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"I bought this one after I saw it in one of my friends place, and thought would be a great fit. The glued area within the edge protector is a total waste and does not presist on any surface. When comparing the inner edge of the strip and the area assigned for the glue strip, its not fair. I have tried using it in all different types of surfaces and it did not last for more then 3 days.",1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I got these for the edges of our coffee tables and they are doing the job.  They have enough cushion to prevent my son from hurting himself.  The double sided tape that comes with it seems to be sturdy.  None of the cushions have fallen off or been pulled off.  I really like that the color matches the dark wood furniture.,4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Note: KidKushion makes the standard (this product) and the jumbo. The standard is thinner and about 3/4"" x 3/4"". The Jumbo is about 1.25"" x 3/4"", thicker and has a nice sculpted look. This one is fine, but I perfer the jumbo.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"The foam roll does a great job of protecting the kids and adult knees from hitting the hard edges.  My only complaint is that outer layer for the adhesive doesn\'t come off as easily as the 3M on for the Prince Lionheart products.  Otherwise, great product at a great price.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,Being one continuous length allows you to cut to the size you need.  Other products come in pre-cut lengths and you piece them together. this works much better.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"We have a tile step up from our living room to our dinning room and my baby has hit his head on the step a handful of times.  He always cries, but, he has never sustained any injury that needed anything more than a kiss.  There was one time when I though I heard a crack.  The incident resulted in a bump on his head, but, no fractures, bleeds or anything else.I never really thought much about this item until my friend (who has a similar step in her house ... but no kikusion toddler edge kushions) told me her little boy hit his head on the tile step for the first time and he ended up with an open wound about in inch long and it bruised up the size of a tangerine.  :(",5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I used this to cover sharp wall corners and it fit perfectly. I bought 3 rolls. Thick cushion and no problem with the tape. We have it several months now and it still works great. My baby is safe in the home.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"These edge cushions are on the dressers in our 10-month-old\'s room. They stick really well, there is plenty of tape if you only put it on one side like the directions say. Our baby hasn\'t managed to pull them off......yet. I would recommend it.",4
Gerber 3PK Terry Burpcloth - Boy,"These aren\'t great burp cloths, but they are excellent dish cloths.  They\'re thin, but strong and it\'s easy to wring water out of them. They\'re long, so are good for sweeping up a big mess.  They\'re also better than baby wash cloths for bath time and are good for cleaning up a toddler after eating.",4
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Off White,Used this on the edges of walls bc my 1 year old son runs at 110mph. Saves your sanity and your nerves.,4
Clippasafe Ltd Baby Neck Supporter,The pillow is small so only plan on it being useful for the early months of your baby\'s life. My wife uses it during bottle feeding sessions to keep her neck in a good feeding position. Our baby\'s neck is strong enough to support her noggin under most circumstances now so we only use it for feeding.I docked two stars because the build quality is not all that great. It developed a tear in one of the inside seams after about a month of moderate use.,3
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"I like the concept of this pacifier. If I could give a 2.5, I would. The flaw for me is it keeps closing while in my baby\'s mouth.  So she doesn\'t like it, which ruins the practicality.  I\'m going to give this more time since my baby is only 5 months old.  I\'ll change my rating if this ends up working out later on. (However, when it falls, it definitely does what it should do...it closes!)",2
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"We only use these pacis! DS won\'t take any others, and they\'re so clever with the self-closing casing. Only reason it\'s not 5 stars is because of the red ring it leaves around his mouth when he uses it for a while (like at nap time) but I think it says, ""Not to be used for sleep"" so that may be user error ;)",4
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"Compre estos chupos por internet y  a mis hijos les encantan, inclusive tengo de otras marcas pero prefieren estos.El unico contra es que la  tapa  que se cierra para que permanezcan limpios, les queda marcada en la carita cuando chupan muy fuerte.",4
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,I am not using this myself but bought it as a gift. It is as described.,5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"My 8 week old son hates this pacifier.  He is constantly spitting it out.  The worst part of it is that half the time, it doesn\'t even close after he\'s spit it out.  I was expecting a lot more from this pacifier.",2
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,See review under other similar items; love Ethan the Penguin.  These close up as promised to keep pacifier cleaner for baby.,4
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,I was absolutely delighted when I received the RazBaby Purple Dots pacifier.  Looking forward to seeing how it works when the baby comes.,5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,mydoesnt like it because it keeps closing on him when he has it in his mouth my grandson get very upset and cries.,2
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"The part that closes is bulky and due to that, my son barely gets half the binky in his mouth. He has to suck really hard to keep it in, which not only leaves a red mark around his mouth but an indent! The concept is great, I just wish it was better designed. We\'re just going to stick to regular binkies from now on.",2
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"The concept is nice, but as other reviewers pointed out, it closes AS it hits something, not before.  My bigger problem with it is that it\'s hard, and not soft like most other pacifiers, so his face can get red while sucking on this.  If he were to hit something with it in his mouth, he could probably get really hurt, so we just don\'t use this because of that.",2
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,This pacifier is not my son\'s all time favorite but it does what it\'s supposed to: it closes on the way to the floor when he spits it up. and that\'s why I\'d recommend it,4
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"The new Mom loved this pacifier!  The new Dad is a pilot, and he loved it as well! They were so happy that the airplane face  had big eyes and a smile!",5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,MY SON WONT TAKE THESE BUT THEY ARE GREAT. HE WILL ONLY TAKE NUK PACIFIERS. THEY WOULD BE A GREAT GIFT FOR NEW MOMS!,4
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"I had high hopes for this pacifier, as we have 2 dogs and 3 cats and my son\'s pacifiers get instantly covered in hair as soon as he drops them. Even on a pacifier holder, they would fall onto his clothes or blanket & pick up dust and hair instantly. So to say I was excited about this product would be an understatement. Here is what I wish I had known before I purchased it:The keep-it-kleen pacifiers DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE! They have a mechanism that keeps the cover open, until it is jarred/knocked, at which point it snaps shut. This is great for pacifiers that fall on a hard floor from a substantial height, but when it just gently rolls or falls from my son\'s mouth when he is in his car seat or stroller, the impact is not enough to make it close, so it just stays open, lying on his shirt/blanket/whatever picking up hair.Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does not have very good air flow, so the inside of the pacifier tends to fog up instantly and I\'m not sure this is very hygienic.In summary, I guess that a pacifier that closes some of the times it is dropped is better than one that never closes (ie a regular pacifier), but for the price, and the fact that it doesn\'t work in both large and small drops, I would not recommend it.",2
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"I thought this was a neat idea, because my son often drops his pacifier. When I take him out, I use a pacifier clip, but not while we\'re in the house. However, the nipple and the shape of the Razbaby is too big and clumsy, he didn\'t take to it. He prefers Nuk pacifiers.",3
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"Got this as part of a baby gift for a friend. I couldn\'t believe how cool it was that it closed up when dropped. Everyone thought it was really neat and had never seen it before. This is one of those ""why didn\'t I think of that"" type of gadgets.",5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,It leaves marks on my sons face from the parts that close.. my son doesnt like this pacifier wish it didnt mark his face :(,1
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,Basketball is the way of life in our family.  Family meetings and bonding time all happens over a game of B-Ball.  Everuone loves the fact the new edcition in the family represents tradition.,5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"I had to put one star because it is a requirement to mark a star.  Wish I didn\'t have to.  I ordered the product for my niece for her baby shower, but she never received it. Was told that it got ""lost in transit"" and that I was reimbursed.  Still waiting to see if I truly was reimbursed, therefore, I am unable to rate this product.",1
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"5/1/2012: We\'ve had these pacifiers since Super Bowl weekend (beg of Feb). We do love them, but they do require more work to clean, so we don\'t use them as often. True, they don\'t fall open on the floor, but they still need to be washed. You have to wash them in warm soap water, so it takes more time than the dishwasher. Not a lot more time, but with babies, it\'s hard to find time to do this sometimes. Only other issue, they don\'t always close when they hit the floor. Usually they do, but it\'s about a 5% chance it doesn\'t close, espcially if it\'s on carpet. Otherwise, good product. I wouldn\'t pay the $7 I did for the baseball one again, but the $4 ones are okay on price.PS: You also can\'t have the baby sleep with this pacifier because it closes and they can\'t open it on their own until about 11/12 months.",4
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"It doesn\'t do what it claims it does. The cap closes AS it touches the floor, not BEFORE in the air... It makes no sense, since it gets dirty anyways, although it closes... right after....Plus they sent me a totally different pattern than the one I ordered. NOt worth it at all.",1
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,This is adorable and my niece\'s favorite pacifier. Highly recommend.  She is teething now and this pacifier has endured all of her chewing!,5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"These pacifiers are the best!! They actually work too!! As soon as the pacifier drops it closes as soon as it hits the ground!! We had a few of these because they were so great, and they worked for as long as we had them, we only quit using them with our boy when they were eventually lost or when we took all his pacifiers away. Definetly buy these!! You will be so glad you did!!",5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"My 8 week old son actually really liked this paci, but it leaves little red crescent indents on each cheek. It works well & closes like its supposed to, but the red marks it leaves are a little concerning.",3
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,My son loved it!  He used it all the time when he was little.  I would buy more of them next time.,5
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,"Based on use with an 8-10 week-old baby.Pros:Adorable graphic designSafe and sturdy materialsSolid constructionBaby likes the large nipple knob and seems to find it more satisfying than smaller knobbed pacifiers.Cons:Lines left on baby\'s face by the spring-loaded nipple shield (temporary but they do make baby look funny - not good for impromptu photos)Difficult to get it into baby\'s mouth without the shield slipping free and snapping closed too soon (has even snapped closed on baby\'s nose while I try to get it into her ever-so-wiggly mouth)Large nipple stem/neck makes it hard for baby to keep it in her mouth (skinny stem offers a good site for her to trap the pacifier with her gums)Large nipple stem/neck is not orthodontically favorableIt would be nice to see this implemented with a small stem and large knob in the same semi-firm material.It is apparent that effort was made to reduce the tendency to leave lines on baby\'s. The portion abutting the baby\'s cheeks is very smooth and rounded but this isn\'t enough given a baby\'s chubby protruding cheeks (and my baby is not ""heavy"" but a little on the leaner side). I think reducing the depth of the shield would help; it really doesn\'t need to be that deep to protect the nipple if the sides (when closed) of the shield were flexible rubber instead of also being hard plastic.In the end, I cut off the shield with heavy wire cutters and filed the resulting plastic stumps down until they were flush with the nipple housing so we can use it like a typical pacifier instead.",3
Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier - Adam Airplane,Very cute and a very practical idea for pacifiers.  It also helped that my daughter in decorating the nursery in lady bugs.  :),5

Graco Premium Stroller Weather Shield,"Unless your baby/toddler have found a way to maintain sanity during the winter months without the need to step outside the home, this is a must in the northern half of the US. We used to live in northern Wisconsin and now live near Chicago. We found that this product really works as it is supposed to. It stops rain, wind and keeps our son warm whenever we take him out (of course, he has to be properly clothed as well).My wife and I love it. We have no complaints.",5
Graco Premium Stroller Weather Shield,"This is a really nice rain sheild, it fits nicely over my Graco Quattro Tour Deluxe stroller. There is a really nice ""window"" for the baby/child to look out where the plastic is smooth and clear. there are mesh vents on the side which you can keep open or closed with the snaps. Keeps kids dry all the way down to their toes. Keeps items in the basket dry as well!",5
"LA Baby 3 Shelf Wooden Changing Table, Natural","Based on the other reviews I wasn\'t expecting much from this one.  I was pleasantly surprised at: the quality, it looks very good in our nursery; how sturdy it is, it feels like I could climb up on it, no wobbles at all; and finally, how easy it was to put together, my wife had it assembled in less time than it took to get it out of the packaging.  This is our fourth boy and I definitely prefer a changing table like this one that has open shelves instead of drawers or doors.  All of the pieces were there, we didn\'t bother installing the safety strap that someone else ranted about since we never used one for the first 3 boys, plus the changing pad you put on top has a strap of it\'s own (which we cut off) -- just keep a hand on the baby at all times and don\'t leave to go answer the phone or do something else equally stupid...",5
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2007","We purchased a Graco Pack and Play for when our new grandson visits.The only thing that went according to plan was removing it from the box.  This thing should be simple - right.  Wrong.  We were able to snap the ends in place - we could not snap the sides in place.  One of the straps that secure the bottom of the crib to the legs soon ripped off.  We finally gave up and decided to fold the ends up again.  You do this by depressing a button, opps, that didn\'t work either.  One end just won\'t come unsnapped.  Perhaps I should read the instructions, the only instructions are printed on the bottom of the crib, they say snap it in place and push the button to unsnap.  Great help.  Made in China, I should have known better.My wife tells me that her brother has this same product for his grandkids.  He got it together, folded it up to move and was unable to put it up again.If you want a headache buy this thing.  Junk.To top everything off, I went on the Graco web site to give them feedback.  The web site would not accept my comments.",1
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2007","This product is wonderful.  You can fold it up and take it anywhere in a snap.  You MUST read the directions.  My husband tried to put it together when we first got it home and it took him almost an hour!  I decided to read the directions after we collapsed it to move to another room.  It went up very quickly!  Ours had a set of directions in a pocket under the mattress.  The only thing that we didn\'t like were the sheets that we purchased for it.  They weren\'t very snug fitting, so we decided not to use them.  We now have some stains on the bottom mattress.",5
"Boppy Total Body Pillow with Slipcover, Natural","After much thought and countless hours of research to find the best maternity pillow for my wife I settled on this one. We were very satisfied with Boppy\'s nursing pillow with our first child that I assumed the quality would be the same with this product. Was I mistaken! As soon as we took it out of the package and opened it up, it looked so limp and flat from the start. It offered no support at all! I was considering keeping it and filling it myself, but I realized for the price, I shouldn\'t have to do that. Even cheap pillows would have more filling. Do not believe what you see in the picture. I thought that it would be as supportive as their best-selling pillow. I gave it two stars rather than one only because I liked the shape and design of this pillow and the fact that it came with a pillow case. I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I am with Boppy. I normally read and don\'t write any reviews, however, I was so unhappy with this product I needed to let the public know. Please reconsider if you were expecting a quality product.",2
"Boppy Total Body Pillow with Slipcover, Natural","I did extensive research and chose this pillow a couple months ago. I\'m 8 months pregnant and just could not get comfortable at night. This pillow has made such a difference. It\'s soft, and can be molded into many different positions. After frequent use it does get flatter and the stuffing gets a little bunchy, but I prefer flatter pillows. Don\'t get this if you want something super thick and fluffy. But DO get it if you want something pliable but supportive. I highly recommend it!!!",5
"Boppy Total Body Pillow with Slipcover, Natural","I read the reviews prior to making a purchase, and I have to say, I\'m glad I bought this one despite some negative reviews.  I don\'t think any body pillow can help you sleep on your side if you\'re used to sleeping on your back.  I mostly sleep on my side but found it so uncomfortable to try to sleep on my side now that I am 5 months pregnant- Boppy body pillow definitely made sleeping on my side comfortable and switching from left to right was easy. I am so glad I purchased this Body Pillow.",5
"Boppy Total Body Pillow with Slipcover, Natural","This is the most comfortable pillow to sleep with. I looked at a few others and they had a cheap scratchy cover and you had to purchase a cover to keep it from scratching. This is soft and comfortable. It looks like a strange shape, but it really helped to relieve my hip pain.",5
Chomp &amp; Clack Alligator by Melissa &amp; Doug,My one year old grandson loves this toy. He pushes it up and down the halls of our house with a huge grin on his face. Walking behind him makes his parents laugh because he jauntily struts as he pushes. The toy has helped him with coordination and balance while he is having fun. He took his first steps just a few days ago. I don\'t think he considered this achievement nearly as enjoyable as pushing his alligator.,5
Chomp &amp; Clack Alligator by Melissa &amp; Doug,"We purchased this product at a local educational toy store for my 1 year old for his first birthday. As far as its use as a walker, it is VERY sturdy. We have owned plastic walkers in the past and this one is substantially sturdier (as in, it won\'t tip over as easily when baby pulls up on it) It does require some basic assembly, I think it was just putting two screws in. The wheels have a rubber ring around them so it gets very good traction on wood or carpeted floors. As the toy is pushed the alligators open and close their mouths at regular intervals. Great fun for chomping sisters\' barbie dolls. All three of my boys (ages 1, 2, and 4) LOVE this toy and frequently fight over it (so that could be good OR bad depending on how you look at it!) The only caveat to this toy is the NOISE, when pushed quickly it lives up to the \'clack\' part of the name, it clacks LOUDLY. That is the only reason I didn\'t give this toy a 5. However, I highly recommend it.",4

Dream Baby Drawer Catches 3 pack,"For a Mommy who is amazingly precise with power tools and measuring, these were 20 times more difficult to install than they should be. Plus your drawer has to have the right features or they won\'t fit. Using them is okay, once installed. But I recommend placing them on the side of the drawer that is less accessible to baby\'s hands, otherwise baby will grab at them. Also, coach your spouse not to slam drawers or these will ruin.",2

Tike Tech Trax360 Double Stroller - Canyon Orange,"Pros: beautiful, totally unique lime green. Great handling over the roughest terrain. Easy to push fully loaded with babies. Comfortable handle. Babies can put their feet up over the handlebar and totally lounge. Great brake, very secure.Cons: sun shade won\'t keep the sun off til they are about 3 - their heads have to be waaay up there to be underneath it. One of my babies (1 year old) cries every single time the sun is in his eyes and the shade is no help. Reclines too far back and can\'t sit up straight (drives same baby crazy). Very hard to fold and unfold, very heavy and unwieldy, and doesn\'t get that much smaller folded. When folded, it is very precarious and can tip over. Since I have nowhere to put it and must keep it in my living room, I leave it unfolded with the brake on because at least it can\'t fall on them. Straps are HORRIBLE. They are at least a foot too long, take a long time to disassemble and adjust, and keep slipping to be too big. I have never had so much trouble with straps in any baby product.",4

KidCo G16 White Center Gateway Extra Tall 42in,"I bought this gate hoping to deter my autistic daughter from going up or down the stairs. Let me just say, when that child gets an idea in her head there is no stopping her. However, it works great on my son. Sadly he is trying to follow in my daughters footsteps by hopping it but in general it is able to block his escape.Update: So dropped from 4 to 2 stars. The button has been pushed in and broken so it won\'t lock in place. Still opens and shuts fine but for the amount I paid, I would expect it to last a bit more. Also the pieces on the end keep coming loose, making the gate fall over. Really should have been a better product for what I paid.",2
KidCo G16 White Center Gateway Extra Tall 42in,"Very high quality and sturdy gate, but my cat learned to jump it. He is 2 years old. So if you think you can buy this to keep your cat out of somewhere, it\'s not gonna happen.",3

Lite-on-Shoulder Ring/pouch hybrid Baby Sling(Vine Sketch),"Overall was happy with this product.  Honestly, we didn\'t use it that much, but when we did, it was useful.  It was a nice print and nice looking.  It came with a manual of alot of different ways you could use it, but honestly, they weren\'t very descriptive and were a little confusing (for example, the picture they\'re showing, I\'d never have felt comfortable using it that way, but maybe it\'s just me.)  However, for the typical small baby, laying down, it was nice because I was able to carry her hands free while she slept and was covered (from sunlight, noisy people, etc.)  After a while, tho, it may start to bother your shoulder, since it\'s only one shouldered vs the backpack style ones, it did mine once she got around 15 lbs.",3

The song is played with very soft and soothing sounds and my son likes to listen to it when he is cranky.

Infantino A Day At The Fair Puzzle,"We got this puzzle for my daughter\'s third birthday because she is crazy about carnivals and had just begun to show an interest in many piece puzzles.  At first I thought it might be too hard for her but after a day or two she could quickly assemble it.  She recites the clues she uses to put it together as she goes along and when it is completed we use the cardboard children as little dolls and walk them through the fair.  Plenty of other small creatures from her collection visit the completed puzzle and make their way down the winding paths to the various rides and games.  Yes, the carousel often comes apart but that enables other toys to have a spin on it.  I give this five stars as it is entertaining on its own and expands to include other creative possibilites.",5

It has two butterflies on it with the giraffe, and says ""Sweet Dream Hugs"" and on the next line ""From Flutterbugs.""

Infantino Disney Baby ~Deluxe Shopping Cart Cover,"This is a wonderful Item. I hated putting my oldest 2 in the shopping carts and High chairs when they were babys because they were always so dirty and grem ridden, so for my 4month old I decided to get a cover and I love it. It is so easy to use you just slip it on and line up the leg holes. It makes for a nice clean place for him to sit and covers all the bars in the shopping cart so no more piched fingers or chewing on gross bars. It also works great in most resturant high chairs. And it comes with 2 toys already on it and loops to add your own. Another great buy!!",5
Infantino Shop&amp;Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula,"IT advertises on the package that you can use as a mat- but don\'t! The animals are on strings and if they are not taken off it is a choking hazard.

Infantino Shop&amp;Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula,"Fits the standard and bigger shopping baskets (buggies), but not so great for the standard wooden high chairs at the restaurants.  That\'s why the four star.",4
Infantino Shop&amp;Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!  I get so many comments and compliments every time I use it.  It works great, covers the shopping carts completely, even the large shopping carts at the wholesale stores.  It also works great for covering the high chairs in restaurants.  I was reluctant to buy this at first, friends would say it was something I didn\'t need and no one I knew that had one liked theirs and never used it.  But I am so glad I did!  My son likes to chew on everything, including the bars on the carts and high chairs.  No matter how good I cleaned them before I put him in, I always felt it wasn\'t clean enough and I would cringe every time I thought about him chewing on them.  And it\'s so easy to use.  I can even put it on and take it off while I\'m holding my son.  It is just large elastic that slips right over the back and front and the sides have velcro to attach over the sides of the cart.  It has 2 detachable toys that my son likes to play with/chew on.  And it is so easy to clean - just take the toys off and throw it in the wash.  Would recommend this to every mom!!!",5
Infantino Shop&amp;Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula,"After trying and returning another shopping cart cover made by the same company (returned for only fitting smaller shopping carts), I decided to try this one based on the positive reviews.  We\'ve used it a few times in different carts and high chairs, and so far, it has been great!  It uses elastic and velcro, and the elastic really helps it stretch to fit standard and larger shopping carts.  It is pretty cushy, so my daughter seems relatively comfortable sitting in it.  In my opinion, there are 2 downsides: First, it is a little tricky to roll back up while also managing a 6-month-old.  Secondly, I find the ""Hula"" theme and attached toys a little hokey.  The cover we tried previously had a ""Safari"" theme and came with a crinkly ""Zoo Map"" which my daughter found much more entertaining.  Luckily, this cover does have extra loops where I can attach some of her favorite toys.  All in all, I\'m happy with this cover!",4
Infantino Shop&amp;Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula,"I really love this cart cover.  It costs a little more than the ones in stores but I am glad I spent the money.  It is easy to install on carts.  The toys are cute - my 10 month old likes to play with them and make them ""dance"".  Coverage is good. Although I have not used it with any oversize carts yet, I think it should cover them.  Design is really nice - have washed it once and it washed well.  Haven\'t used it on a high chair yet but I get so much use as a shopping cart cover it was definitely worth buying!",5
Infantino Shop&amp;Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula,"My wife and I used to put our twins in a stroller whenever we went into a store that has shopping carts.  The kids would get antsy, it was a mess.

Infantino Shop&amp;Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula,I purchased this cover so that I can shop with my grandson without worrying about the germs that live on cart handles.  This is great and will also keep him entertained.,5
Classic Pooh&#153; Sheer Window Curtain,The product is soo pretty and lights up the nursery!  Fast shipping and transaction.,5
Classic Pooh&#153; Sheer Window Curtain,I absolutely love these curtains.  They are light and sheer and look great in my baby\'s pastel green room with the classic pooh wall stickers.You do need blinds or a shade to go behind the curtains though as they are not meant to cover light.,5
Infantino Total Body Support with CoolMax - Shabby Taupe,"I bought this for my 3 month old hoping it would make her car seat more comfortable, because at this point she is not a big fan of car rides.  I think the padding around her shoulders and head is pretty good and keeps her feeling more secure and comfortable.  I also think that this padding helps a little bit with air flow within her car seat, and therefore she ends up staying at a more comfortable temperature than before.  However, I am disappointed that the bottom is not padded.  I was hoping it would provide her with another layer of padding all over, but there is no padding whatsoever under the baby\'s butt. Had I known this, I wouldn\'t have bought the product.  However, that\'s not to say it wouldn\'t work for somebody else who is just looking for shoulder and head padding.  It is reasonably priced.",3

Infantino Where\'s My Tail Puzzle,"We bought this for our daughter\'s second birthday.  She has recently shown more interest in puzzles and can do most peg puzzles on her own.  She absolutely loves this.  It is fun for her to find the matches, say the animal names or sounds, and put the pieces together.  She sometimes needs help, but she can usually put the pieces together by herself once she has a match.  This is a nice intermediate puzzle to move her to the next level from peg puzzles to regular ones and a great activity to do together.  The pieces are very sturdy, but a child who is used to wood puzzles needs to be watched or they may chew on the pieces.",5
Infantino Where\'s My Tail Puzzle,"We purchased these for our daughter when she was about 18 months old and she has always really enjoyed them! They are a good step up from the simple chunky wooden puzzles and offer a bit more of a challenge to her at this point. She loves searching through the set to find the matching tails for all the animals -- overall they are quite entertaining for her! The puzzle pieces are thick & sturdy - she\'s been playing with them for about 3 months now and so far the only signs of wear & tear are on the box - the puzzle pieces still look great! And speaking of the box . . . my one small complaint is that the little rope handle that goes over the box lid is so short that it is difficult for us (parents) to open and therefore nearly impossible for our daughter to open - hence the ripped lid of the box. But, I guess I don\'t know if we just somehow ended up with a shorter handle than most of them have. Overall, a very fun product and I would recommend it if your toddler loves puzzles!",5
Infantino Where\'s My Tail Puzzle,"I got the Infantino ""Where\'s my tail"" delivered last month, I opened it but was disappointed by the quality of thin cardboard animals.  I would not give this to my kid just because the cardboard will chip and get wet if my kids put this in her mouth.",2
Infantino Where\'s My Tail Puzzle,This is a fabulous puzzle. My son was 10 months when I bought it and he loved it. The pictures are very easy to see and it is very easy to match them up. Even if your child is to young to put them together it is very easy to match the tails and the heads to make the full animal. He is almost two now and loves it even more. I am very happy with this product. The best part is that it is so easy to take along with you!,5
Infantino Where\'s My Tail Puzzle,"i bought this for my 3 year old, this is a very simple and sweet puzzle although does not challenge the child as much but however its simplicity makes it attractive.my 3 year old finished it within 15 mins at  first so now when she usually is playing with other puzzles she solves this first.but must say it very well made and packaged.",4
Baby Trend Magnum Expedition LX Jogger Travel System,"I love the stroller and the fact that it doesn\'t get stuck over every little bump.  It takes some getting use to maneuvering though.  The carrier part is good but does not protect baby\'s head very well.  You need to get your own head protection to keep baby\'s head from flopping all over the place.  Not crazy about the buckling system because it\'s more complicated than it should be.  But easy handle to carry in and out and back and forth.  Overall, it\'s a good travel system and I would recommend it to a friend with a side note to get your own head protection.",4
Baby Trend Magnum Expedition LX Jogger Travel System,"On the carseat, the handle ALWAYS is very difficult to put down. Everyone of my family members AND daycare had issues with it. You have to press both buttons pretty hard and sometimes a few times.I agree with EVERYONE about the front wheel. But it didnt happen right away. I used this carseat for about 6 to 8months before it started happening. My daughter is 2 now and she doesnt really care but next baby will have a new stroller!When an infant is in the carseat and its clicked into the stroller, it is forward a little much but honestly, that didnt bug me. My daughter took that fine. Shes had a strong neck since birth though.I picked this out for the longevity of it. Its neutral colors, its my favorite kind of stroller (jogger) AND a carseat to match! So it could go through with all our kids. BUT, ITS TERRIBLE!Whats the 5% good thing? Storage! This has 2 cup holders, so daddy and mommy have a cup holder. Also a compartment in the middle of the cupholders for your keys and camera, ect... that is closed so no one can see your valuables. And a strage basket on the bottom. Thats... about it!Do NOT buy this stroller. I would never refer this to ANYONE I know cuz the $200 my mother paid for it was pointless cuz now we need another one for the new baby!And Im so glad I didnt even call customer service to have all this stuff fixed cuz then Id obviously never be able to use it after they get done with it!!",1
"Baby Fanatic Pacifier Clip, Dallas Cowboys","Bought this for my newborn, named Dallas. Loved it at first. Then the stars started rubbing off so there were just dots left. Slowly the dots started peeling/rubbing off also. Then the clasp started rusting when my boy figured out how to pull it off and chew on it. Its was cheap so I guess it was worth the money while it lasted. I just wish it had lasted a little longer. Oh well. Go Cowboys!",2
"Baby Fanatic Pacifier Clip, Dallas Cowboys","***Every Dallas fans baby needs one..good quality and fast shipping!!The clasp is tight, shouldn\'t have any problems with it coming off..Would recommend this product to others.***",5
"Baby Fanatic Pacifier Clip, Dallas Cowboys","This is a nice pacifier clip with the subtle yet distinctive Cowboys logos. The clip is very strong and, while it takes a bit more effort to open/close than others we have, it also stays attached better.",4
Silver Cross Balmoral Pram - Navy,"We were given a Balmoral Pram at the birth of our daughter (1977), and it has been our favorite neighborhood walkabout for her and her children ever since.  It\'s not useful for trips or shopping, of course, since it can\'t be collapsed, and it would be too big for your trunk, even if it could be.It\'s mildly bouncy and jouncy on those great curved spring-steel slats the carrier rides on, and the babies LOVED that. Ordinarily it would put them to sleep, and if they wouldn\'t sleep, a mild increase in jouncing induced giggles... much preferred to crying.  The buckled leather straps that attach the slats to the carrier are subject to dry-rot, but easily replaceable in any harness shop.As an urban stroller for walks around the neighborhood or in the local park, it\'s absolutely perfect.  And the LOOKS you get!  Priceless.",5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","I didn\'t find it very hard to open like a lot of people have said, you have to use a little muscle but if your careful you won\'t spill the formula out. You don\'t want the lid to be too loose or it will spill formula all over the diaper bag afterall. I have had a tiny issue with formula going into another compartment, but it was hardley any and not enough to toss it over. Holds just the right amount of formula for my baby.",3
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary",The lid is hard to get off and snap on.  It serves it\'s purpose but there are others out there for more money that are easier to use...i picked this one because of the price.,3
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary",Easy to use. Am wondering though how long it will be useful for. It hold 3 formula scoops now with a little space left over. What will happen when it\'s 5 scoops. Compartments could be a little bigger. Could not choose color.,4
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","As always, I did some research before I bought this item and some reviews almost made me look for a different option. Ended up ordering it and I am glad I did. It is the perfect size, easy to open, simple to use, fast to clean, and super convenient for when you\'re on the go. Definitely recommend it!",5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","This thing DOES NOT LEAK.  It can hold up to 5 scoops of Enfamil in each of the 3 chambers (= 10 oz in the bottle  x three), and is easy to dispense, even with one hand, on a turbulent airplane. For refills, the whole top comes off super easy as well. (For those who have trouble removing the top, try lining the spout up with a chamber line&#8230; i.e.. yank the top up from where it\'s sturdiest.)",5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","With my first daughter, I had tried a different brand.  After the first day in the diaper bag, I had 4 feedings worth of formula all over EVERYTHING in the bag because it didn\'t seal tightly.  I went with the 4-oz travel ""tubes"" of formula, which aren\'t exactly cost-effective unless your baby is eating 4 oz or 8 oz at a time.Right before my second daughter was born, my mom found several gently-used baby items at a garage sale, one of which was this dispenser.  I was skeptical after my experience with the other dispenser, but after trying to take the whole lid off I realized just how hard it was to open.  This is a good thing!  It keeps it from spilling in my bag and keeps my toddler from opening it.  The spout cap is easier to open than the whole lid, but is still snug enough to stay closed.  If you try to take the whole lid off while there\'s powder in it, you do have to be careful, but I don\'t find myself doing that a lot. Usually, I open it when it\'s empty, fill it up, and use what\'s in it before I open it again.  I haven\'t had any issues with powder leaking over into other compartments, but I\'ve always twisted it to the middle of each compartment.  If you look at how it\'s made, the lid/spout is curved, so if you don\'t get it mostly centered, yes it\'s going to spill over.  However, because of the tight fit, if you center it, it doesn\'t move/twist from movement in the diaper bag.  The seal is worth the split second of effort, imho.I have been using mine for 2 months now (and that\'s after getting it secondhand) and it\'s worked great for me.  With daycare and overnight trips to grandma\'s house in the near future, I will be buying a couple more of these.",5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","My 3 Nuby formula dispensers have gotten a lot of use over the course of 6 years and I\'ve never had a problem with any of mine.  No parts have ever broken, the formula/snacks have never leaked from one section of the container to another, and I\'ve found the lid to be tight enough to keep things secure, but not so tight that I\'ve ever had a problem getting it to open.  Five stars here!",5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary",very convenient and works like it\'s supposed to. no problem with opening or closing-seals perfectly! me(new mom) and my new mom friend love it,5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary",I have this formula dispenser and one other formula dispenser that is another brand. Out of the two I always use this one because the lid seals tightly and is actually hard to pop off. The lid on the other brand I have does not stay on very tightly at all and has actually come off and spilled formula everywhere. These dispensers are so handy because you don&#8217;t have to lug a huge can of formula around or pay even more money for the individual packs of formula. Definitely the best 7 bucks I ever spent!,5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","Great to have for formula storage, light weight and stores easy, love that it has seperate compartments and the lid turns when you need to change sections!",5
"Nuby 3 Stage Wide Neck Feeding Bottle, 10 Ounce","We used these bottles in the transition away from baby bottles. Our daughter took to it right away and we thought we had finally found a winner. But after repeated use and washing each of the nipples leak, the vent hole also leaks. We have to change soggy shirts a few times when we used these. Still looking for the best sippy cup for our picky daughter!",3
"Nuby 3 Stage Wide Neck Feeding Bottle, 10 Ounce","I absolutely love this bottle system!  How can you beat a bottle that you can use from birth all the way until your child can drink from an open cup?  It allows a baby to transition from a regular bottle nipple, to a sippy cup type of nozzle, and then to a straw.  It is designed with little hands in mind and it is very easy for my baby boy to hold onto.  It is easy to take apart and clean without a lot of cracks and crevices to try to get into for cleaning. This would make a great gift to yourself if you are having a baby, or for a baby shower gift!",5
"Nuby 3 Stage Wide Neck Feeding Bottle, 10 Ounce",I was able to ween my one year old off the bottle in two weeks with the nuby 3 stage  bottle,5
"Nuby 2 Pack Soft Sipper Replacement Spout, Clear",Be careful ordering this product because you may end up with WHITE and CHEAP sippy nipples that do bot fit your bottles.. SO AGGRAVATED,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Soft Sipper Replacement Spout, Clear",Our go-to dippy cups. I was able to convert regular bottles to sippy cups. Everyone who sees these wants them. Wonderful invention!,5
"Nuby 2 Pack Soft Sipper Replacement Spout, Clear",This product are perfect to my baby. i recommend it. Thanks NUBY for make this excellent product. nO MORE COMMENTS,4
"Nuby 2 Pack Soft Sipper Replacement Spout, Clear",These work great with plastic bottles too! I was able to put these on my daughter\'s bottle and no fussing about wanting a bottle anymore. Nipples gone in one day. I can\'t rave about this product enough!!! Just for clarity: these replace nipples on bottles into sippy cup spouts. My whole house is thanking the makers of this great idea.,5
"Nuby 2 Pack Soft Sipper Replacement Spout, Clear",I\'ve had a lot of trouble getting my daughter to give up her bottle.  I bought Nuby bottles so I could work on transitioning her to a sippy cup by using these nipples.  She will now drink water out of her bottle using these so hopefully a sippy cup isn\'t far away.,5
"Nuby 2 Pack Soft Sipper Replacement Spout, Clear",Great for transition  from breast feeding to bottle. Then from bottle nipple to sippy. My sons favorite bottle.  He\'s 19 months now and still uses these.,5
Nuby Medi-Nurser - Blue,Buy a little bottle and use it! It\'s cheaper and the nipple will be softer than this product. My son did not like it at all and refused to use it.,1
"Nuby Bottle Brush With Net Scrub, Colors May Vary",I use this to wash my son\'s bottles and it does the job perfectly.I went through probably 4 of the bottle brushes that have metal connecting the handle to the brush. They all broke but this one since it is made out of plastic seems very durable.I use quite some force when cleaning my bottles as well.,5
"Nuby Bottle Brush With Net Scrub, Colors May Vary","Cleans glasses, cups, bowls and bottles easily. The scrubber on one side and the brush on the other cleans better than it being all brush. No problems.",5
"Nuby Bottle Brush With Net Scrub, Colors May Vary","not very flexible. Its very rigid, My favorite brush is still the OXO bottle brush but I will use this for dishes.",3
"Nuby Bottle Brush With Net Scrub, Colors May Vary","This is the only bottle brush my mom and I found for my baby sister\'s bottles.  It didn\'t fall apart after a week and it cleaned the bottle well.It is slightly harder to get into the mouth of a standard-sized bottle opening, but not that much.  Its sturdy construction completely makes up for that.The bristles are slightly more firm than they would be on your average bottle brush, which worked in our favor.",5
"Nuby Bottle Brush With Net Scrub, Colors May Vary",The brush is huge !  .. Compared to bottles should be a little bit smaller.Should advertise one Brush in picture considering they are only sending one not 3!,3
"Nuby Bottle Brush With Net Scrub, Colors May Vary","I have always had a hard time cleaning camelbak bottles, but have found that this does a good job in getting in to all the hard spots. Good price, and decent cleaning, this is better than the others I have used from oxo, and cheap store brands. Worth every penny",4
"Nuby Bottle Brush With Net Scrub, Colors May Vary",This is perfect to clean my steel water bottle. The smaller scrubber hidden in the handle is perfect to get into tight areas of the lid. Gentle and never leaves scratches.,4
"Nuby Toilet Trainer Seat, Colors May Vary","It is simply a life saver, an answer to my prayer, i went thru a few before i found this and my search is over,works perfect! and looks great,and for the price, simply the best! A+++++++++ Thank you cookieskids!",5
"Nuby Toilet Trainer Seat, Colors May Vary","First, this seat will only work for you if the inside of your toilet seat is big enough.  There is no standard internal hole size for a toilet seat.  Most standard seats and most elongated seats do fit this insert.  Just check your seat and make sure the internal hole is at least 10"" front to back, and 8 1/4"" side to side.Our (elongated) toilet seat is a little too long, and we have to push this insert all the way to the back of the toilet to keep it from falling in.  We used to have to hold it in place at the back, but once our son learned to use it, he no longer fidgeted enough to make it slip forward, and now we have no problem with it.It\'s cheap and relatively portable.  We take it with us in a tote bag when we go shopping.  Usually we just set it on top of the commercial seat, and not under it.  Our son has no problem using it.The best feature of the seat for boys is that it has a high pee guard that helps keep urine IN the toilet and off the floor.  This is especially helpful for baby boys doing elimination communication (infant pottying), who tend to point out instead of down.  Also, because of its one piece construction, it is easy to rinse off and keep clean.  Not sure why the small parts warning is on this item.  It is a solid piece of sturdy plastic.  You might get a pink one, but who cares?  We got purple.  The price is right.We had another seat that was horrible -- it had a white vinyl cover decorated with ducks, that was clamped to the bottom of the plastic seat with a plastic ring screwed into the seat itself.  When you lifted the baby off the seat, there was a whooshing sound as the seat sucked in air -- and any pee that happened to get splashed on it -- into the cushion.  Yuck!  This one is much better.",5
"Nuby Toilet Trainer Seat, Colors May Vary",Unable to use it because it doesn\'t fit my toilet. It just flops around in there and I can\'t put the seat over it either.,1
"Nuby Toilet Trainer Seat, Colors May Vary","None of my kids have been fans of training seats or potty seats I\'ve gotten in the past; they\'ve all wanted to use the big potty just like Mama and Daddy. Most seats that fit onto the commode slide around, have to be snapped into place (which means they can be broken when snapped back off) or are bulky and can be difficult to store. This toilet seat is different.Pros:The price is great, about half of what most seats of this quality cost.It has a completely smooth, cradling seat that could be used by any child who can sit up without assistance; it would be great for ECing with an infant.It sits under the toilet\'s regular seat, so that it fits any toilet and the seat holds it in place.It has a pee shield that is also built into the seat, but doesn\'t get in the way for a little girl, and is also smooth edged so no ouchies can happen when little boys get on or off the seat.Because of the smooth, simple design, it is easy-peasy to clean. There are no gaps, crevices, or plastic seams that mess can hide in.It is fairly compact, so I can easily store it beside the toilet for easy access.Cons:The hole is smaller than some other potty seats, which is part of what makes it great for smaller bums, but it also means that training a boy to aim is a little harder. My 4 and 5 year olds who have been using the toilet for 2 and 3 years, respectively, pee on this seat every time.Because it fits under the regular seat, it does add an extra step when (if you leave it off) the little bum needs to make use of it, or (if you leave it on,) a less-little bum needs to make use of the toilet. Not really a big deal, but if you\'re like most moms, and only get a chance to go pee when your bladder is about to burst, it can *feel* like a big deal.Because of the way the pee guard is designed, even my older toddler has trouble getting on the seat quickly without  some assistance.I do want to add that my currently-potty training child is only 13 months old. His big brothers were much older when they started potty training, and I\'m fairly certain they wouldn\'t have been able to use it without getting poo on the back of the seat when they were learning at age 3ish. My small-framed almost-three year old daughter will sit on it it is already on the toilet when she needs to go, and she seems to fit comfortably enough, but she does prefer it isn\'t on. Maybe it\'s just because she\'s been trained for over a year and is used to using the toilet without one, but I\'d see about checking one out in person before buying this for an older toddler.All in all, I love this seat. All the cons are made up for by the pros (in my opinion,) The boys pee on it, but it\'s easily cleaned. It\'s slightly more of a hassle to put on the toilet and take off, but by leaving it beside the toilet, I can still get it on before my son goes on himself...most of the time. My older daughter has trouble getting on it by herself, but we just leave it next to the toilet and that eliminates that problem. I will certainly recommend this to friends and family with young toddlers.",5
"Nuby Toilet Trainer Seat, Colors May Vary","After searching in store & online - most potty chairs & training seats either have a guard that falls off or is too low to actually work for a little boy. I had to return the one I bought at W***art because if that reason. For the CHEAP price that this one offered, I decided to give it a try and see if it would fit my toilet. I love how the ring lifts & it fits under it. I was SO excited that this worked so well and again  for SO cheap!! The only downfall of this type of seat is you have to be very attentive to see if they ""went"" since you can\'t check the potty. I would highly recommend!5 stars!",5
"Nuby Toilet Trainer Seat, Colors May Vary","This product came just as advertised and overall it work well however, I\'m not so happy with the fit under the toilet seat. Although I believe the design makes for less messy clean up.

Nuby Nasal Aspirator and Ear Syringe Set,I like that it has good suction and can be taken apart to clean well. I did not see that the ear syringe worked as well.,5
Nuby Nasal Aspirator and Ear Syringe Set,"before it was eaten by the dog, I used this to remove the ever-present snot from the teeny tiny nostril of my littlest one.

Nuby Nasal Aspirator and Ear Syringe Set,We were sent home with 2 bulb seringes from the hospital when I had my twins. I sent my husband to the store to buy a seringe for them since the other seringes mysteriously disappeared (we have other kids too).My husband came back with this bulb seringe and it did not even suck any mucus out. It might be useful for something else but it\'s useless for sucking snot out of babies noses.They sell the same seringes the hospitals send baby home with on Amazon anyways.,1
Born Free Variable Flow Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,Purchased these to give formula with cereal ...followed instructions (3 drops facing up) and the flow is just too slow.  My cereal is not that thick only 3 teaspoons per 6 oz.Going to give Y cut a try.,3
Born Free Variable Flow Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"I agree with the other reviewers who said that the nipple is just too fast. Only buy these if your baby is OLDER than 6 months. These can not be used for babies under than age, without the baby gobbling down the milk and then spitting it up because he/she couldn\'t tell they were already full. Just spend the money and go for the level nipples up until 6 months...after that it SHOULD be ok. Be good to the children and have fun with them!!",2
Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,My daughter loves how these nipples offer a fast flow. She\'s two years old and with these nipples she can drink 8 ounces in a minute! Before she used to cry because the flow wasn\'t fast enough.,5
Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"I am very happy with this brand of nipples. I wish we had started using these earlier. We started using these when my daughter was 6 months. We tried many other bottles including, Platex Airvent, MAM Anti Gas, Advent and several others. She got nipple frustration with every other nipple. The others were not fast or soft enough. The Born Free Nipples and bottles are great for her. She was using the #4 Advent at 3 months. Then we moved to the thick liquid nipples by 4 months. The Advent was okay, but the nipples were to hard for her and just not fast enough. They would tire her out. The Born Free #3 Nipple is very fast and soft. After about a week of using these, our daughter began finishing bottles quickly and happily. These are a great nipple for babies that need a very fast nipple. I also free the are good quality.",5
Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,Love the Born Free Bottles- my LO took to them right away.  Like the small amount of parts to clean.,5
Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,Very well constructed. Safe. Just like natural nipples. And each faze o f sizes are also nice. Thanks again! Hello!,5
Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"My poor baby was taking 10 minutes to finish a bottle and her cheeks were rosy red from working afterwards. I bought size 3 nipples and she\'s sucking her bottles down in 2-3 minutes and much happier :) I love Born Free bottles  - highly recommend! Oh, and it may or may not do you good to know she is now 10 months and using these, we switched around 9 months and she probably could have started around 7 1/2 - 8 mths.",5
Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,I switched from using Avent bottles to the Born Free bottles when my daughter was just a few months old. She took to them without a hitch and has been using them when she\'s not nursing ever since!,5

Born Free Y-Cut Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"I love using the Y cut nipples for my baby\'s cereals and for baby foods to serve on the run.  It would take a really large chunk to clog them.

"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I have always been a fan of Dr. Browns and Avent bottles, but recently had to throw out 4 Dr. Browns bottles due to leaking and 2 of my Avent bottles also began leaking.  I know how to properly assemble both brands, but no matter what I did they continued to leak (mind you, they\'ve only been used for 10 weeks).  I have tried every bottle you can imagine (Dr. Browns, Avent, Tommy Tippee, Milkbank, Playtex...) and have to say that I LOVE LOVE these Born Free the best!PROS:-They do not leak-The actual bottle is easier to clean due to wide mouth (as opposed to the Dr. Browns)-My son has had zero gas with them-They do just fine in the dishwasher (obviously keep them on the top rack)-They hold 5oz as opposed to 4oz (like the Dr. Browns smaller bottle)-They\'re small & compact, thus easier to pack in the diaper bag-If you use a bottle warmer, they warm up better/quicker since they\'re so compactCONS:-More parts to wash than the Avent, but same as Dr. Browns (still not a hassle to wash though in my opinion)",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We tried the following vented bottles:- Dr. Brown wide- Playtex Ventaire- Mam- Born FreeThe Dr. Brown bottles were a relative PITA to clean.  The Playtex Ventaire and Mam bottles are both vented from the bottom, and their venting mechanisms are very similar.  They\'re much easier to clean, but tend to leak when warming up milk/formula in them.  This happened in bottle warmers, and even when we tried warming the bottles in a cup or bowl of hot water.  We did notice our baby really took to the nipples on the Mam bottles though.  After using those, she rejected all other nipples.  The Born Free bottles are vented at the neck, similar to the Dr. Brown bottles, so they have no leakage issues when warming up milk/formula.  They\'re also a bit easier to clean than the Dr. Browns.  After receiving the Born Free bottles, the first thing we did was replace their nipples with Mam nipples, so we can\'t comment on the Born Free nipples.Also, in the product pics that MLM uploaded of the bottles being melted in a microwave sterilizer, I\'m not sure which brand of sterilizer that is.  We have the Avent microwave sterilizer, which looks identical, but have no issues with the bottles melting or discoloring.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",This is the only type of bottle we have used during our four months with our daughter and we have seen no need to switch. It is convenient that Born Free has various stages of bottle nipples to use with the same bottles to allow you to transition your baby without having to buy new bottles. We are pleased with this product and brand.,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",Main benefitsBPA freeNice look and feel.Easy to clean since they have a wide mouth until Dr. Brown\'s bottles.,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","For our first kid back in mid 2007, we succumbed to the BPA paranoia and dumped our beloved Avent (Polycarbonate) bottles for these expensive Born Free BPA-free Polyether Sulphone bottles.  And they have served us faithfully for two years (our 2 year old is still using them).  But I curse every time I have to wash the bottles, with their two extra complicated parts (compared to the Avent bottles).  In Sept 2009, we had our second child, and we went back to Avent.  Since every other maker of bottles has a line of BPA-free bottles, we no longer have to accept such a complicated bottle with so many extra parts.  So this time around, we went straight back to Avent\'s new Polypropylene (PPE) BPA-free bottles.  No more Born Free for us! (But becareful with Avent...don\'t buy the honey-colored PES BPA-free bottles, which come in the yellow-color box.  These PES bottles leak!  Buy the PPE Avent BPA-free bottles, which are cloudy in appearance and come in the blue-colored box).",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I have been using these bottles for about 4 months now and have grown to absolutely love them! At this point I think I like them even better than Dr. Brown\'s because the nipples are softer and more supple. I\'ve used Dr. Brown\'s, Avent, and Playtex bottles, and these are my favorite. I discovered that the reason the bottles leaked is because I was trying to use the Avent nipples with them as some reviewers had suggested, and it just doesn\'t work. The nipples fit the bottle, but the bottoms of them aren\'t flat like the Born Free ones, and that causes the link. After wasting my money on the Avent nipples I decided to use the Born Free ones, and the bottles haven\'t leaked once since then. I also haven\'t had problems with nipple collapse. The nipples did collapse once or twice when they were new, but I haven\'t had it happen at all since. Both my baby and I really love these bottles, and we are very happy with our purchase.",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I have tried probably all the bottles available on the market, cause my son had collicks. And these are the best out there.  I recommend these bottles  to all my friend- moms.  This design allows for easy cleaning,unlike Dr. Brown, where u have to have different brushes.  My son is 20 months now, and still uses them.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",Easy to clean and put together.  Baby does not take in lots of air with these.  Do not leak.  Great bottles!,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  These bottles are HORRIBLE! The Level 3 nipple is so fast that my 8 month old son chokes on the liquid.  I actually had to replace them with level 1 and the nipples collapse.  I ordered the sippy cups for my 2yr.old - not realizing they are NOT SPILL PROOF -My son likes to play with the cup and now I have to worry about spills.  $140 down the drain!  *****If you want bottles w/out BPA just use Evenflo - these bottles do not contain BPA.  I found this out AFTER I purchased & used the bottles.,1
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","Awful. The people that are saying these dont leak are talking about the bottle itself not leaking from the neck, us with older babies that hold their bottle and throw an shake and hold upside down--- these are the worst. Like a faucet dripping. Ill stick to my $5 nuby no drips",1
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I love these bottles. They are very easy to clean and not like the dr brown\'s ones. My son also loves them. He is now 14 months old and we are still using them.,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","Way too many parts to these bottles, and all need to be handwashed. Lots of bottles are BPA-free now and all the ones we tried were easier to use than these. We ended up using Medela bottles because it was easy to work with the breast pump parts.",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We switched to this bottle system when our daughter was 6 months. I wish we had done it sooner. We tried many bottle systems including, Playtex Airvent, MAM Anti Gas, Advent and several others. We had settled on the Advent. This is a good system, just not for our girl. She was still spitting up a lot at six months and we had to keep buying faster and faster nipples, until at four or five months she was using the variable flow thick liquid nipple and quickly these were not fast enough. She would tire out and finish only about half her bottle. The Born Free with the #3 nipple work very well, with in a week she was finishing bottles and the spit up went down to almost nothing. Part of the reflux decrease may have been her age, but I believe the bottles help quite a bit. The Born Free nipples are very soft and the #3 is very fast. The combination is great for our little girl. She is a very happy little girl using these bottles. The quality is very good. The measurements are off a little, as are many bottles. The UK measurements seem to closer to US ounces according to my measuring cup, so I use the UK measurements. Neither seems to be off by that much, so it probably makes no big difference either way.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","Born Free 9-Ounce Wide Neck BornFree Bottles Twin PackAfter researching BPA free items, I decided to attempt to switch my 4 month old from Avent Wide bottles to the Born Free bottles.  The nipples are VERY similiar, though a little softer.  I have had no issues with them closing and have been very happy with the bottles.  My daughter transitioned very well to them.  Appears that they are a pretty popular item as I can\'t buy them in the stores now in my town.  I would highly recommend to any new mom (or old moms for that matter).  If anything, they provide a little piece of mind.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",these bottles are qreat to give your infant milk and small amounts of cereal in the flow is slow so your baby cannot drink to fast,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","When our 2nd baby was born in 2008, there was a big movement towards BPA free bottles and I jumped on the bandwagon and went with these Born Free bottles as many moms recommended them to me. We had used Avent with our 1st and these looked very similar.Well they turned out to be not just good but FANTASTIC! They NEVER leak and the nipple is big and wide that it did not create confusion when transitioning from breast to bottle.Yes, there are more parts to clean than the regular bottle and they are one of the most expensive bottle out there but they are worth EVERY PENNY!When our 3rd baby was born, 5 months ago, I bought some Avent BPA Free bottles to try and they were a leaky mess. My husband even said he wanted to go back to the Born Free.I recommend these to anyone and everyone who wants an awesome bottle that will last a long time, is safe and doesn\'t leak.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I bought these bottles for my 3rd child after using Advent for the first two.  Although expensive, these bottles work great.  My son can drink the whole bottle without me having to stop in-between to burp him.  He took to them very quickly after being breastfed for the first 5 mos of his life.  I had read in some reviews that people had their bottles break when dropped but I have not had this problem, even after dropping one on our driveway.  I would highly recommend these bottles.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",My daughter always swallowed air while drinking milk. These bottles eliminated the problem. She blows air back into them and its automatically taken out by the bottles inner system.,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I like that the bottles are BPA Free - I feel good about using them to feed my baby.  But I don\'t like dealing with the extra vent parts - it\'s just more parts to wash.  I tried using the bottles without putting the vent in and the nipples just collapse - so you have to use the vents.  But overall I like these bottles.,3
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I absolutley love this bottle . I have had avent dr browns , gerber , adiri,and playtex and this one is the best . For us it works just like a dr browns my son is colic and dr browns works the best for that . But you do not have to clean that middle part that I hate cleaning . I love the wide neck bottles they are my favs .The price ia a little too high though",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",Please give us an advice if we can use these glass bottles for drinking regular water. My daughter is almost 7 months old and we use Playtex for milk and Avent for water but she is constantly choking on Avent bottle (with #2 nipple flow)...If it is OK for water then what will be the proper nipple flow? I know that at the age of 7m we suppose to use flow #3 but again maybe if it\'s just water #2 is fine. Also i have to consider that she is growing and #2 might be not enough fast soon for her...Thank you!,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We threw away all of our Dr. Brown bottles because of the BPA problem announced on the Baby Bargains website and swtiched to these at their suggestion.These bottles are a big step down from Dr. Browns in every way except for the BPA-free feature. There are more air bubbles, they are wider than the standard size Dr. Brown bottles which makes it difficult for my baby to hold them, they are harder to clean, and for us the biggest problem has been that the nipples collapse all the time. This is frustrating because nipple-collapse avoidance is mentioned in most of their on-line product descriptions!My son hates these bottles. He\'s developed a gas problem he never used to have and cries during feedings when the nipple collapses. I\'m about to invest yet again in a new set of BPA-free bottles. Wish me luck.",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","My daughter had jaundice when she was born, so our ped recommended supplementing...so we did, using these bottles and we haven\'t looked back. She\'s primarily on formula now and hasn\'t had an issue going from breast to bottle and back (maybe it\'s just her! - lucky me). I recently had an issue with the nipples collapsing, but just figured she was ready for the next size nipple, we tried size 2 and it worked like a charm. Since day one, she\'s never spit up much and has one good burp after eating and is happy right away. So, I love these bottles, yes they are on the expensive side, but they\'re easy to clean and since my daughter loves them, I do too :)",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","Look no further, these are the best ""safe"" (BPA-free & unbreakable) bottles you\'ll find. The wide neck makes pouring milk into them very easy without spills. They\'re lightweight & easy to clean - those inexpensive Munchin bottle brushes will work fine. We used the level 1/slowest flow nipple for our son\'s entire first year because we found the higher flow nipples allowed too much milk to spill out everywhere once he was able to feed himself & carry his own bottle.We were skeptical of pretty much all plastic bottles, and so our first purchases were glass bottles - but we learned the hard way that glass definitely isn\'t the best option for an active little baby. We tried Wee-go Glass bottles w/silicone sleeve, which by the way, we DO NOT recommend because our then 10-month old dropped and broke 2 of them, leaving little shards of glass on the floor(!!).Born Free bottles are currently the safest way to go. A time-saving tip: serve only cold or room-temperature bottles. We don\'t recommend heating any type of plastic bottles ever - even ""safe"" plastic bottles like these. If you start kids off with cold bottles they\'ll be happy with them & won\'t know the difference.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I wish I had believed the negative review before I purchased these bottles. Their venting system is not good. I can see lots of bubbles come out when my baby takes his milk. The worst part is when I first screw the nipple on, and test the milk flow, the milk will actually gush straight out, which could potentially choke my baby. I have to unscrew them, and then tight the top part again. Do it at least three times. You can imagine there is no fun doing this with a hungry baby in your arms crying for food. In fact, my baby got mad so many times with these bottles that I have to stop using them. Dr. Brown is way way better, although it is not BPA free. I am not sure about BPA part, but I am sure my baby does not like these ""Born free"" bottles.",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I bought these bottles, along with glass ones to get away from ones with BPA.  I love using the glass bottles, but I thought these would be easier when I am out, as they are lighter to carry in the diaper bag.  They are terrible! They leak constantly, yet I keep trying to use them and tighten all the parts. The nipples also collapse. In all, an expensive item that is not worth anything.",1
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I registered for these bottles because everyone raves about them however I too, found that the nipples collapse AND I have had so much leakage around the white ring that holds the nipple in place while feeding my son. I thing they are highly overrated and expensive when there are so many other less expensive BPA free bottles on the market now.",1
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","At the moment these appear to be the only bottles, other than glass, that don\'t also poison your children with the estrogen-like substances (bisphenol) found in Avent and other plastic bottles. But the design isn\'t as good as Avent, and they tend to leak unless kept completely upright. It\'s a fair price to pay, but it\'s a shame that they didn\'t deal with the leaking problem as well.",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","This is the best bottles ever build.  My baby, (3 month old) is happy besides is BPA free..  I recommend it.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We love Born Free!  Our daughter is 5 months old, and she is holding the bottles all by herself without a problem.  The only gripe is having to clean so many parts, but we love having a BP-A free product.",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I just got this bottle because they are BPA free, my son like his milk warm. The problem I have is that the nipples collapse all the time, I use th Y nipple. I love the Avent bottle ant now they have BPA free bottles that you can combine with your old nipples. BornFree nipples are very expensive. I have tried everything and I think Avent is just the best. Dr. Browns are difficult to clean and time consuming to assemble. Avent is simple , nipples never collapse, and those who say that they leak it\'s because they are not closing it properly. Mine have never leaked. I also was very disappointed because I bought a 9oz three pack and when I got them there was only one vent valve included for 3 bottles. I have a coupon to get the other 2 vent systems for ""free"". Why would they not include it in the package? I have been at the store to redeem the coupon and they are always out.",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","These bottles were all the rage when I had my first child 5 years ago and they worked great. I kept the bottles for the next time around and now I am using them with my second child. I needed a couple of extra bottles, so I purchased them here. I mostly hand wash them, but I sent them through a dishwasher quite a few times as well. They still look great and kept all their markings, silicone nipples didn\'t crack. These are very high quality bottles and the valve system prevents the baby from swallowing the air, although you still should burp your baby.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","Have used Born Free bottles in the past and were always well pleased.  These bottles purchased from Amazon are not of great quality, three of the six nipples that came with the bottles did not have holes in them. What a disappointment for Mom and baby.",1
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I switched my son from Dr. Brown\'s bottles to these Born Free ones, after learning about the BPA in Dr. Brown\'s.  At first, these bottles were great!  My son made a very easy transition from the Dr. Brown\'s to these.  After about 1 1/2 months of use, my daycare provider started having problems with the nipples collapsing.  I have tried everything from making sure the collar isn\'t too tight, to looking closely at the slit in the venting system.  I can\'t seem to figure out what is going wrong.  It doesn\'t happen all the time...just periodically.  I emailed Born Free over 3 weeks ago and I haven\'t heard back (not very good customer service if you ask me).  Overall, I am glad I am feeding my son out of BPA free bottles, but I wish the nipples wouldn\'t collapse.",3
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We were very happy with our Dr. Brown\'s bottles. But we switched to Born Free after learning about the bisphenol-A scare. We used the BF bottles for 2 months with no problem but now the silicone vent is broken. The middle tip of the vent (the part that points downward) somehow has a slit in it. This makes the nipple collapse and frustrates the baby. So far, I cannot find replacement vents. We\'ll likely return to the Dr. Brown\'s bottles. These were too expensive to break after only 2 months. I would not recommend these until the replacement parts become available.",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I got very paranoid after all those reviews about clear plastic bottles having bpa and therefore being unsafe....these were a guaranteed safe bottle, so I switched...they\'re safe to boil, or put in dishwasher...and my daughter had no trouble switching. the only thing i don\'t like is the fact that they are wide necked..i\'d prefer a standard nipple..there is less confusion to babies..and if you want to use the ready to feed 8oz bottles for let\'s say traveling..as i just did, you can use only a standard nipple. But regardless, at least there is peace of mind about no bpa at all!",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I felt a little trapped into buying these since there are not that many BPA free options.  I quickly figured out that they leak really badly unless you buy the inserts.  Bottles that leak are miserable as the last thing you want to be doing- while exhausted at 3:00 am is dealing with leaky bottles.  Gets all over the baby and then you have to change them, waking everyone up more.... miserable.  They worked fine for me after I figured that out but that is not acceptable for such an expensive bottle.  I also am annoyed to have to clean the extra parts for absolutely no extra benefit.  Very dissappointed.  I used Avent bottles for my first and if they had a BPA free option I would do that first.  Maybe they will soon!",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We tried several types of bottles (Avent, Dr. Browns, Gerber) and these are the ones that worked the best. No leaks like other brands. Easy to assemble. My daughter loves these. They are a little pricier but well worth it.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","These bottles are the only ones that don\'t get my little one all gassed up!:-)  I\'ve used Nuk, Avent, Pampers, store brand, Playtex Nursers and even Dr. Browns.  Dr. Browns have way too many pieces to clean and I never quite felt they were clean enough.  The Born Free bottles have only 2 extra pieces for the vent and are super easy to clean.  The inverted nipple part of the vent can be cleaned very easily by using your nipple brush.  I know they aren\'t different colors and are kind of plain, but you can get glass bottles and buy colorful sleeves for them if that is important to you.  I highly recommend these, it\'s worth the price!",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","OK, so like most of the concerned parents out there who use the Born Free bottles, I too switched to this brand because the plastics do not contain BPA. However, we just broke our third bottle (plastic, mind you---NOT glass). The first two broke when my daughter dropped them onto a linoleum floor and asphalt parking lot; this most recent one she dropped onto our hardwood floor, from a distance of no more 18 inches high. We have never boiled our Born Free bottles, and my 18 month old daughter is no Hercules, so I do not expect plastic bottles to break consistently like this. When I contacted customer service, they claim that they have never heard of this problem before and promptly replaced the bottles at no charge to me. They score big points with me for the free replacement, but I find it hard to believe my child is the only one out there who has broken one, let alone THREE, of these bottles. We\'ll be switching to one of the other BPA-free alternatives out there (and yes, there ARE other choices available).",3
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I highly recommend these bottles.  Since they are expensive, we just have fewer of them than we would have with other brands - you are supposed to wash bottles soon after use anyway.  I was concerned about bisphenol-A in other bottles, and feel much better using these.  I mostly breastfeed my baby, and he still took to this bottle right away.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I got these bottles because my daughter wanted them for my grandson. They seem good, but all the pieces are a pain to assemble and clean. They are also quite expensive. Hope they help reduce gas.",3
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","Love these bottles.  I know they are safe and they are the only nipples my daughter will use. She is mostly breastfed, except a couple days a week when mommy is back at work.  Getting her to take the bottle was a HUGE challenge but she ended up getting the hang of it, although she still prefers the breast to the bottle:) The only downside that I can think of is there are a lot of parts to wash/sterilize, but I also bought the microwave sterilizer and a dishwasher container so it makes it a little easier.",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I am very pleased w/the born free bottles & nipples. And very relieved to find a safe bottle for my baby.  the bottles work fine & don\'t leak like the avent bottles.,4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I have tried just about every baby bottle! I avoided Born Free because of the cost and the additional parts (the valve system)I should have just gone to them from the beginning. These are the only bottles that don\'t leak- in 5 months of use I haven\'t had a single leak- not like Avent, where I was constantly covered in formula!You can save some money on the nipples- Dr. Brown wide bottles are the same nipple.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I have been using Born Free since my baby was born. (4mths now) These are the only bottles that we will buy. My son is mostly bottle fed with breast milk. This is the only bottle that didn\'t try to drown him when he was a newborn, but will step up as he starts to get stronger with his sucking. I only had the glass ones initally and now I am switching to plastic. I have tried avent, breastflow, dr. browns, evenflo, mam, tommy tippie, and medela. (was trying to find good cheaper bottles) But my son does so much better with Born Free!  They don\'t leak, easy to clean, and the nipples never collapse.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","The only reason we got this is for BPA free. It is complicated with many parts to clean. It does not vent when you screw the nipple on too tight. However if you let it loose, it leaks!!! We think we are pretty good at fixed things, but these are hard to use compare to Advant bottles.It will take Advent nipples, but it will leaks too. However Advent nipples vents much better. If only Avant makes BPA free bottle, we will swiych back in a second. It did not get one start becasue of the BPA:(",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I started out with the dr. Browns bottles but they leaked so much they were such a hassle.  These leak once in a great while and are easy to clean.,4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We didn\'t have spills, nor colic, and you do get used to cleaning all the little parts... but I have to say that in retrospect that these bottles were pretty underwhelming.  We switched recently to the plain old Gerbers now that he\'s past the colic stage, and he\'s drinking faster with less post bottle throw up.  We had wondered why he was so slow compared to the first kid (who was on Avent) but now we know.  Hopefully Avent figures out the BPA free leaking thing for new parents.",3
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I ordered these for my sister-in-law.  This is the product she chose to use for her baby, and I was glad to find them at Amazon for a great price.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","My daughter had the 5 oz bottles, but now she\'s drinking more, so I had to order the bigger ones.  The nipples work great for her because they aren\'t too big and we never have any leaking.",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I\'ve been using born free bottles (glass and plastic) for 8 months now.  When I first started, I noticed that the nipples would collapse at every feeding.  I emailed the born free customer service and they told me that the silicone venting slit can  stick together when sterilized. They recommended that I massage open the slit when putting the bottle together.  This worked 50% of the time.  When the bottle collapsed during feeding, I would have to unscrew the bottle and let air enter.  After using them for some time, the nipples no longer collapsed but the bottles started leaking.  It seems to me that the silicone venting system needs to be replaced every few months.  I bought new silicone vents and they\'re not leaking now.  I\'m not going to buy another brand because I already invested so much money in these bottles.  If I had to choose again, I would not buy born free again.",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I bought these bottles after doing extensive research and reading the Baby Bargains book.  These bottles are advertised as being clinically proven to reduce colic and gas.  They did not work for my baby who has had horrible gas pains since we brought her home from the hospital.  We recently switched to another brand and her gas pains have virtually disappeared.  Before we couldn\'t go one feeding without giving her Mylecon and we haven\'t had to give her any for days now.The other reason I do not like these bottles is their inserts which make it time consuming to clean and put the bottles together.  If they actually reduced gas I probably wouldn\'t mind, but since it doesn\'t the inserts are useless and the bottles leak without them.My advice to new moms is to purchase a sample of several types of bottles and determine which is best for your baby and your routine.  Since there are so many more options for BPA free bottles now, you have a good variety to choose from.  Personally, I wouldn\'t choose these bottles again.",3
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","After having spent a considerable amount of $$$ on an avent bottle supply, I was leary to make the switch.  I am so happy that I did it.  Although the bottles are a bit pricey, it is so much better having the piece of mind that I am not causing my son any harm with a chemical-laden bottle.  And a friend of mine helped me save a lot of money by pointing out that the nipples from dr. browns and Avent bottles work perfectly well in the bornfree bottles so no need to spend extra cash if making the switch.  The only down-side to using the nonbornfree nipples is that the bottle caps dont fit snuggly so leaking can occur, but it has not been an issue for me, I just wait to make the bottle when I am going to give it to him, and use my finger to cover the nipple when I shake it.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","My six month old has been using these bottles since he was about 4 weeks old. We were using Avent and Dr. Brown bottles but heard about these that are BPA free. Yes they cost more but we would rather feel more secure in knowing that they won\'t leak anything harmful (possibly) into our baby\'s body. We have not had any problems with them and we have quite a few. We have both the 5oz and the 9oz as well as the glass ones (we got those accidentally but they are also good, just too heavy for now) and when we have had a leaking problem all you do is untwist them and twist them again and you are good. Excellent bottles. And our son does not have any more or less gas than he did with the Dr. Brown bottles. Avent was not a favorite although it does seem to be very popular. Of course if they were BPA free I might think they were ""okay"" but threw all of the ones we had away. Also we have the Avent bottle warmer and the Born Free bottles fit perfectly.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I am so happy with these bottles! I bought them because they are BPA free and they are well worth the money spent since you do not have to worry about them. They are easy to use and my baby really likes them-we have not had any issues with them!! I recommend them to all my friends with babies!!,5
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary",I like this sippy cup because it was one of the few at the time that were BPA free.  It was a good starter cup for my son but once they figure out that they can draw and dribble with it by turning it upside down I had to get another type of sippy cup.  Dislike was that it had too  many parts to clean and not spill proof.,4
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","At 4 months, my son stopped taking a bottle. However, he gladly takes milk from this cup. The rubbery spout makes a nice transition from bottle to cup.",5
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","This is the first ""sippy cup"" that my daughter has been able to use! It doesn\'t need a lot of sucking for the drink to come out, which not only makes it easier for her but also reduces her chance of ear infections. It is perfect for the baby having a difficult time transitioning from a bottle to a sippy cup.",5
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","The drinking spout is not a good design. The training cup we had was much better cut in tip. This one our child chokes from the fluid.  So I went back and bought another training cup...but guess what,  it too now had the straight line cut in the spout! So disappointed. Bad redesign to Born!",1
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","This cup leaks. I think the packaging is misleading. I bought this one instead of the training cup because it said it was for 9+ months and my daughter is old than that. Also, I expected it to be leak-free since so many other cups are. What 9 month old would keep his/her cup in the upright position. Definitely not worth the money.",1
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","i have been using thse sippy cups for 3 months now and love them!!  I have never had a problem with them.  They have never leaked (except if it gets thrown very hard on the ground!).  My daughter loves them and has been able to drink out of a sippy since she was 8 months old because of these cups.  She is finally able to use the handles and completely feed herself which is so nice!  I also love the fact that they do not leak any nasty chemicals into her juice or formula. The only issue I have is the price, but they are so worth it!!",5
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary",Concerned about chemical leaching I threw out my old sippy cups and stocked up on these.The drinking spouts leaked all over the place!  Born Free customer service replaced my spouts for free with the training spouts.  Guess what..?  They leaked all over the place too!  If the cups get tipped in any direction they will leak.  Your toddler will have puddles of milk on their highchair by the end of a meal and you will have a soaked diaper bag (even with lid on) if you carry them in your bag.  Don\'t even think about letting them use them in the car!  One throw under the car seat...you\'ll never get the rotten spilled milk smell out of your car.I am giving them 1 star for being a Bisphenol-A free product.Do yourself a favor and save your money (they are expensive!).  Buy sippy cups with a #5 rating on the bottom which is the safest plastic for your child and hand wash them.I\'m totally disappointed!,1
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","I bought this cup for my son because of the non-leaching plastic.  He already has a Klean Kanteen sippy cup (which works great!), but I decided to give the Born Free drinking cup a try. The cup is easy to clean and easy for a small child to hold.  After reading the reviews, I knew that I was purchasing a ""drinking cup"" which can leak, instead of the Born Free sippy cup version with a non-leaking spout.  I thought it might teach my 14 month-old how to handle a cup more carefully, and in many ways it has helped him learn that he needs to keep the cup upright. My only complaint about this cup is that after a couple days of use (and some biting on the soft spout) the flow hole became larger causing MUCH more spillage than when the cup was brand new.  We now have to be VERY careful that this cup is kept upright at all times or the result is a large puddle on the floor or wet spot on my son\'s clothes.  Overall, it\'s a good option for a safe toddler cup, and it\'s less expensive than the Klean Kanteen or the Sigg.",4
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","I only have three things to say about this cup:1. It leaks, a lot.  Kinda defeats the purpose.2.  It has seven parts.  Are you kidding me?  Trading one environmental issue for another.  Wastes materials, time, and water to wash all of that.  Oh yeah, and it leaks.3.  The packaging only mentions hand washing.  What mom of little kids and babies has time to hand wash leaky, seven part sippy cups.In summary, I want to throw this environmetally safe cup in the nearest landfill.  Oh yeah and it leaks.",1
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","Initially, I thought I liked the bottle. After 2 days of using it, I regretted buying them. Luckily, I only bought 3 (Drinking cups). Such a shame because I would have liked to continue using them (because they are BPA-free).  The other reviews talk about leakage and they were right. The spout hole gets bigger, quite easily, not with normal usage I\'m sure, but with chewing. The Drinking cup has a hard spout but unfortunately, not hard enough for both my girls (3 yrs and 1 yr). They both like to chew on the spouts. Only Avent sippy cups have survived their teeth...I found assembling them a chore after using the Avent sippy cups. Takes much longer to wash these (has more parts) than Dr Browns bottles which I\'ve used and hand-washed for more than 2 years.Same number of parts as Avent cups but the Born Free cups has more \'nooks\' to clean.Perhaps I expected too much from a cup that cost $10.99(Babies-R-Us).....",1
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","I recently purchased this sippy cup for my third child, who is 11 months old.  If you are looking for a simple cup that\'s easy to manage, this is not the cup for you.  I took it apart to clean it, and was surprised to discover that this cup breaks down into SEVEN pieces (cap, handles, mouth piece, ring for mouthpiece, 2 valve parts, and a lid)!  This cup is a missing piece waiting to happen!",2
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","My son is almost 7 months old & I just started him on sippy cups.  He had absolutely no problems transistioning from bottle to Born Free cups.  The handles are very easy to grasp, and the soft spout is a good transition.  Plus, they\'re BPA free!",4
"Born Free 2 Handles for Cup and Bottle, Colors May Vary",what can I say more than my kids like the handles.  I would not purchase the Born Free Cups in the future (I have many complaints but the handles are not one of them).,4
"Born Free 2 Handles for Cup and Bottle, Colors May Vary",These handles fit my Dr. Brown bottles and they work great. I would buy these a thousand times more. Love love these for babies starting to hold there own bottles.,5
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary",Best bottle for kids.. I have used all kinds of bottles and born free is the way to go.. They are free of chemicals and very strudy and durable.,5
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary",The spouts do leak however it is made of soft plastic which my son likes alot better than the regular drinking spouts. The drinking spouts are made of hard plastic. I love how you can convert the born free bottles into sippy cups for transitioning. Would recommend these bottles and the spouts.,4
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary","I would recommend getting the drink cup spouts instead. The holes are much to small in these spouts, rendering them useless.",1
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary",We tried these for a few weeks when it looked like our son was ready to move on from the standard bottle.  The theory being that we could use our current bottle system and go from these to the green nipple to make full sippy cups.  The flow was simply not good enough and the green ones flowed to fast.  In the end we just broke down and bought sippy cups with diaphragms (which really aren\'t that expensive)and put these in storage.Kind of a cool idea to utilize your existing bottle system but ultimately not a great substitute.,4
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary",these are the best!!!!!!! sippy cups. both my girls love them. my daughter  loves teething on it and can hold it so well all by herself :),5
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary",I bought these spouts to be used with my Born free milk bottles. I gave up on my Nuk sippy cup coz it was leaking big time. I had to always have a cloth under my baby\'s chin each time he took a sip from Nuk\'s sippy cup. After I used born free\'s training spouts it was great. No more leaks. The only thing I think might be an issue is the fact that the spouts are kind of firm. I find that my baby takes a little more effort in trying to get the liquid out. Though I can see that he is drinking though it would be better if the spout was softer and less of an effort for the baby. I have yet to purchase the handles to fully turn my milk bottle into a sippy cup. I would recommend. Added plus is it adds more usage to the born free bottles.,4
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary","While I thought this was a great option after the bottle, I have only recently discovered what a poor design this is. We\'ve used them for months with no apparent issue. No major leaking( will do if you turn the spout upside down like most cups) but the spout has a small lip on the inside of the rim. You have to turn the whole thing inside out and use a small pointed object to dig around that rim to clean it. I\'ve tossed one already that had developed mold. Almost impossible to clean this. Wish I had known about this sooner but who designs a lip on the inside?",1
"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary","The spouts arrived quickly. Maybe I didn\'t read all of the specifics, but I didn\'t think I was ordering a ""6 month"" spout, which is a very low-flow spout. It needs to be clearer what kind of spout (6 mo, 9 mo, etc.) and what color you are ordering.",4
Born Free Twister Brushes,"If you have Born Free or Dr Brown\'s bottles this is the brush for you! Gets into all those crevices that the Munchkin brush won\'t. Also has a seperate nipple brush that cleans the wide nipples perfect. Sure, it\'s sponge & will wear down, so I have to replace every 4 weeks. For $8. That is fine with me.",5
Born Free Twister Brushes,Expensive but gets the job done. Have to replace every 3 months or so therefore cost dose tend to add up. If you want a safer bottle for your baby/then this brush is a necessity for cleaning.,4
Born Free Twister Brushes,"These are my favorite brushes.  I use them to clean our BornFree glass bottles and Comotomo bottles.  However, they do not work as well with Dr. Brown\'s or other bottles with standard nipples because these brushes will be too big for standard bottles and nipples.  I prefer the sponge over regular brushes so these are ideal for me.  I will buy more in the future when it\'s time to replace them.",5
Born Free Twister Brushes,More worthless stuff in my house.  Thanks Wife!  Used it the first day I got it.  They\'re uneeded if you thoroughly rinse your bottles after using.,2
Born Free Twister Brushes,"The larger brush pretty much sucks, it\'s impossible to get it into bottles without busting the whole thing up pretty quickly.  The smaller nipple brush is aweseome, I wish I could just buy a ton of those.  It is completely perfect for pacifiers and nipples and breast pump parts.",3
Born Free Twister Brushes,"These brushes are the best I\'ve tried so far, particularly the nipple-cleaning brush, as it reaches all the way.  I tried every kind made, it seems, and these do the best job.  The foam hasn\'t torn or anything yet either.",5
Born Free Twister Brushes,"I really like my bottle brushes made by Born Free.  I tossed all my other ones, because they SCRATCH the bottles.  Plastic bottles with scratches on the inside do not get clean.  Bacteria can grow in the grooves so I don\'t use the wire brushes. I handwash 4 bottles a day (I breastfeed most of the time, but my daughter gets 4 bottles of breastmilk a day).  These brushes have held up through 2 children so far, and they are starting to come apart after a year.  I will be buying another set soon, but they really are great.  They do get the bottle and nipple very clean.",4
Born Free Twister Brushes,These are fine if you clean one bottle a day. They just can\'t hold up to regular use. The nipple brush is OK - but it goes pretty quick too. The bottle brush just simply wouldn\'t get the bottles clean. Spend the money on a munchkin bottle brush ....,1
Born Free Twister Brushes,"Love the swivel handle and the nipple brush. Also, this does not scratch plastic bottles. Tried a few different things in the beginning, because these were hard to find in stores. Easist to just get what I want for a better price on Amazon and have it delivered free, rather than go hunting around many stores with a baby. For a busy mom, I love the product, and the Amazon service...",5
Born Free Twister Brushes,"I love this sponge set because it really gets in every nook and cranny of my bottles, sippy cups, and binkies. You\'ll have to buy new sets a couple times per year due to normal wear and tear and general cleanliness. I am about to have baby #2 and I\'m already stocking up on these. Love them, and highly recommend them!",5
Born Free Twister Brushes,"The package comes with 2 brushes; a large bottle brush, and a small nipple cleaning brush.The big bottle brush in the pack is absolutely flawless.  It does it\'s job well, it\'s very reliable, and well designed.The small brush is used to clean the valves and the silicon nipples.  This is the one that I love and hate!  It does a phenomenal job at cleaning, but the problem is that it\'s rather fragile. Within several washes, the sponge literally falls apart, if you\'re not especially gentle.  Born Free does not sell the small brushes separately.  Every time the small brush breaks, you\'ll end up having to replace both brushes, even though the big bottle brush is practically new.  This gets very expensive over time.",3
Born Free Twister Brushes,"While one does not need to purchase the BF bottle brush (Munchkin\'s is more than adequate - better even - at $3 or so), I\'ve found the nipple brush is very useful.  Munchkin\'s bottle/nipple brush Munchkin Bottle Nipple Brush -1 Piececonsists of stiff bristles. While this is fine for silicone nipples, BF\'s specialized vent has the aforementioned ""mini-nipple"" which is very delicate.  I\'ve always been afraid that even gentle brushing with the bristle brush would tear the slit (the silicone is very thin here).  Thus, if one wants BF\'s soft foam nipple brush (which does indeed work well), one will pony up $14.99 list for not only the nipple brush, but also the bottle brush.  They are not sold separately.  They are made of cheap foam with plastic handles - that\'s IT! - and they wear out quickly.  Outrageous to all intelligent parents out there.  The cost of producing these has to be infinitesimal.  Why gouge the consumer for brushes to clean BF\'s bottles?  Insulting and greedy, and counterproductive to generating brand loyalty.",1
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","This cup was great in the beginning for training.  But now after many months of use and dishwasher wear, all of my Born-Free cups are leaking from the bottom.  I can\'t seem to find the hole but milk/water spills all over the table and everywhere. I am over it and spending $$$ on these cups.  My cheap Nuby\'s are holding up better than the Born-free. I am disappointed as I really liked them in the beginning.",2
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","Good bottle with a unique nipple that is usefule to transition from a bottle with a nipple to a ""sippy cup"".  The flow through the nipple is adequate for our son.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","When we ordered this product, we saw that there were assorted colors and we were unable to chose one that we preferred.  We hoped that we would receive a gender neutral color but received a pink cup with pink lids and we have two boys.  Now we have to return the product.  We will not be ordering this item again as we do not want to potentially get another pink cup.  We rated this product with 3 stars.  We do not know specifically how this product works. We wish we would have had a color choice option.",3
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","I bought this cup because I liked that it had the soft spout and that it was BPA free. This cup doesn\'t work for my 7 month old, however, because it has too slow of a flow. My baby gets frustrated trying to drink from it and just gives up. I tried sucking on it and you really do have to suck HARD. This might be great for a baby going straight from breast to cup, but my baby is going from fast flow nipples to a cup and this just isn\'t the one for us.",3
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","We have the Born Free TRAINER cup for our now 9 month old daughter.  We bought it when she was 7 months and she is finally holding it and tipping it up to drink on her own. It\'s not difficult for our daughter to suck water out as other sippy cups can be, and it\'s safe. It does NOT leak, and believe me, we\'d know if it did because it\'s upside down more than it\'s right side up! :)  I think there is some confusion over the drinking cup versus the trainer cup.  They look the same but the drinking cup has a free flow spout, where as the trainer cup does not leak at all!",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",love the bottle the spout is not as soft as a nuk trainer cup. this born free spout is a little hard but soft. would not recommend for babies with sensitive gums. overall good product.,3
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","I\'ve been participating in the Great Sippy Cup Hunt of 2010 for my 10 month old daughter. Although she grasps the concept of drinking from a cup, she would never actually drink much from them. We have tried Playtex, Nuby, Munchkin and Avent among other brands. Finally someone passed along a Born Free Trainer Cup, and we\'ve finally found what we were looking for. As soon as I handed her this one, she was able to drink from it easily and starting draining everything we put in it.-We have the soft spout 6m+ training cup, and it does not leak at all. My daughter has vigorously put that to the test by batting it around her highchair tray, flipping it upside down in her lap, and flinging it onto the floor. We\'ve never had any issue with any leaks.-The handles make it very simple for her to pick up, hold, and tip the cup to be able to drink from it alone.-I like the measuring marks on the side to know how much liquid is in it, and easily determine how much she drank.-The cap fits on the top very well for transport.-Although it does have a number of pieces (cup, vent, handles, spout), I actually find it easier to put together than some of the other brands. I like that the spout is one whole piece, for me that\'s simpler than a brand like the Nuby where the spout had to be fit into the collar to be screwed on.Cons-It is more expensive than the other brands I tried. Average cost for the other cups was around $6-7, while this one is $10-11. I shouldn\'t be surprised my daughter has expensive taste. :-) However, they do sell just replacement spouts which are cheaper, so that can save the expense of having to replace the whole cup when the spouts are worn.-Additional pieces: although I do think the whole cup goes together quite easily, it\'s more to wash and keep track of. Having used Dr. Browns bottles for 10 months now, I\'m getting used to that!This is the one sippy cup that my daughter has been willing to drink from, so that makes it worthwhile for me unless there were major cons. Overall though, there is a lot to like about this cup. It seems to provide a pretty easy transition from bottle to cup. I am definitely going to be picking up more of them for my daughter.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",These are great sippy cups. My 2 year old still loves them. The spouts do end up leaking after about 4-5 months from daily use. We just buy new training cup rubber spout replacements and they are good to go for another 4-5 months.,4
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",My daughter has been drinking out of these since she was 10 months old.  She loves them and they are the only sippy cups we can buy.  She is 22 months old and still loving her trainer cup.  It is an easy transition from the bottle and they do not leak!  until they wear out),5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",It was a waste of money and my baby can\'t suck anything out of the spout we were excited about it but are now made because it was a waste of money,1
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",i am trying to ween my baby from the breast. i have had a difficult time finding him a sippy cup that he is willing to drink from. this cup (in green) and a vital baby straw cup are the only two cups we have had success with. i def recomend it,4
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","Like the other reviewers, make sure you are buying the trainer cup, not the sippy cup and you won\'t have leak/spill issues! We bought this for our 4 month old in hopes that she would drink breast milk from this cup since she is now refusing an occasional bottle. She drinks from this easily and likes that she can hold it. Its allowed my husband and I to have a date night again!",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","When I first got this, my daughter hated it. I almost gave it away. It leaks, not a spillproof sippy. Maybe with the cap, but who the heck can keep up with that thing. A child sure isnt. They walk around with a cup and set/lay it down anywhere. I tried this again as a transition away from the bottle. Some reviewers complained it was too much like the bottle. So I used this cup to get her off the bottle. Great!  My daughter also likes the handles. Much easier to hold. I use it at night and we were off the bottle quickly.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","We\'ve tried 3 sippy cups with my daughter and this is the only one that she can actually dirnk out of. She plays with it a little as well, holding it upside down and banging it against her highchair, and NO leaks! It is just what we needed to transition her into a sippy cup.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","I ordered two and got two pink cups. I don\'t worry about colors coordinating with gender but I think Amazon is setting themselves up for customers to abuse their return policy by not providing better customer service here with the lack of choice in the color.Not much to add here about the experience with these cups that hasn\'t been said already. The design of the Born Free venting system for their bottles leaks 95% of the time for me, so I don\'t expect any less with these since they use the same venting system.",3
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","the pros are that these cups are bpa free and the spout is soft so it\'s great as a trainer cup.  my daughter took to it pretty quickly.  the cons are that there are a lot of pieces and the spout tears easily which turns it into a leaky cup.  my daughter is teething and tore two spouts in one week by biting them.  we used gerber nuk cups for several months before this and those spout never tore. we\'re still searching for a well-designed, leak proof, bpa free cup...",3
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","I was looking for a replacement for the well-loved born free cups my daughter has, but this didn\'t do the trick.  The problem was that the spout was hard, and she\'s used to the soft one.  It was hard for me to identify what I was getting based on the item listing.  I was not satisfied.  I ended up having to eat the cost, and found something local... I wish I had not ordered this...",2
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","Turns out that I hadn\'t been using the part that goes directly on top of bottle, under the spouts. It will leak if you don\'t use this. I changed my review from 3 to 5 stars.This is a great bottle that doesn\'t leak if you use properly. My son really does love them and it was the only sippy that he would transition to, perhaps b/c the spout is so soft.The Born Free website suggests changing the spout every 4-6 weeks.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","I have never rated anything on Amazon before despite being a frequent purchaser, but because this product has (I think unjustly) gotten negative reviews from other people, I had to respond.  The Born Free ""Trainer Cup"" DOES NOT leak.  I think those people who said it does leak must have purchased the Born Free ""Drinking Cup"" that looks almost identical to the trainer cup.  I almost didn\'t buy this product because of the negative reviews, but because I have twin boys who are 8 months old and we have been so happy with the Born Free bottles (despite their expense), I thought I would give these a try.  My boys are very rough on the Born Free Trainer Cups and we haven\'t had a leaking/spillage problem.  The most amazing thing about the spout is that once my boys tried it (and this is true for both of them), they didn\'t want to go back to the bottle nipples!  It\'s spouts from now on.  Now here\'s a money saving tip for those of you who already invested into the Born Free bottles - you can interchange the spout from the trainer cup with the bottle nipple.  Just make sure to put the bottle together with all the pieces as you normally would, except pull the trainer spout through where you would normally pull the nipple.  Since you can purchase a pack of two spouts separate from the bottles for $6 or $7, I would recommend that those of you who already have the Born Free bottles to purchase the trainer cup spouts separately to start with and see if your babies like to drink from them.  If they do, and once you feel they are ready to hold their own trainer cup, then you can invest in purchasing some cups as well.  I don\'t like paying the high prices either, but there are ways to save money and my boys really really liked the bottles (and now the trainer cups), plus I feel like this is a good company to purchase from as their products are bpa free.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",I love this cup and so does my son. I tried a ton of other cups and this is the only cup my son can drink out of. It will leak if it is not tightly sealed but what doesn\'t? It never leaks out of the spout and it is great for teaching my son how to feed himself.,5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",The Born Free training cup is so similar to the bottle system it was effortless to transition.  No leaks to contend with and the spout is good for a teething little one.,5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","This is the cup for you!I did quite a bit of research on these cups before purchasing.  I was a bit confused and had second thoughts about them after reading some reviewers complaints about leaking.  These reviewers are mistaken.  They need to take the time to properly read the instructions and insert all pieces.  This sippy cup is a superior product. It has multiple pieces, that when assembled properly, form a natural vacuum.  The vacuum allows my child to labor less and enjoy more... without spilling a drop!My 1 year old likes to tap and bang her cup on things.  She has been able to create quite a mess with other cups.  This item does not allow a single drop to leave, even after she removes it from her mouth and waves it in the air.Don\'t let the price or bogus reviews discourage you, this item is the one for you!PS-Amazon shipped two of them separately, charging me more and wasting lots of materials...shame on Amazon!  Amazon, please re-think your shipping policies!",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","I\'m not big on writing reviews, but I\'m so irritated that I spent $12-15 on a child\'s cup that makes a mess everywhere.  I appreciate that it\'s BPA free, though it would be better if it were phthalate free too.  My real issue if that it\'s ridiculous to charge so much money for such a poorly designed product.My son just used this again (because all the other cups were dirty) and there were pools of milk all over his high chair tray within 1-2 minutes.  This happens every time and so I rarely use the cup, but I\'ve decided to throw it away now -- which doesn\'t seem all that environmentally friendly -- but frankly I don\'t have a lot of extra time for the extra mess this cup makes.I hope this review stops someone else from making the mistake of buying this cup--and maybe the company will improve their product.",1
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","I switched to Born free bottles after a horrible experience with the new BPA-free Avent bottles. My son was excusively breasftfed up until his first birthday and now that he\'s one, I use this sippy to give him homo milk. Its the only sippy he\'ll take.Ive had no problems with leaking. Ive ordered a few more of these and some replacement spouts. The holes on the spouts are actually starting to tear up after about 6/7 months of use.",4
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue",Handle is perfect for the grip. My baby likes to play with this Trainer Cup. Of course he likes to drink milk out of it. Good Value.,5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","These do not leak as some of the other reviews suggest.  I agree with the previous review that those customers must have been referring to the ""Drinking Cups"".  This is my 1 yr old\'s favorite sippy cup and we have tried several including Tommee Tippee, Gerber and First Years.  The big plus, which has also been mentioned is that you if you already own the Born Free bottles, which we do, you can simply insert the spout in the collar (where the nipple normally goes) and you will be able to reuse the Born Free bottles you already have.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","Having come from the Avent system on kid #1, we rolled on over to Born Free this time around.  While the bottles themselves were fine, these sippy cups are terrible.  First, the handles are very hard to grasp.  They\'re too small and in a weird shape.  Second, its impossible to drink out of.  Me, the wife, the baby, the 2 year old... we all failed to get more than the smallest drop out of it.  Not to mention, after several months, you do get tired of all the parts just for a sippy cup.  We switched the baby to a Playtex one, and he grabbed on right away, and took a good sip out.  As an aside, we switched bottles to simplify now that he\'s past the colic stage and he drinks 3x faster with no throwing up.",2
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","Since my daughter was born, I was using born free products. We bought this sippy cup to replace bottles. She is 15 months old. The sprout is soft ..she liked it ...but somehow this cup keeps leaking even if I squeze it tight. but she likes it so we keep using it for now...",3
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","My baby has used this cup for more than a month (she is now 8 months old) and she loves it.  It\'s easy for her to get the water out, but when she shakes it upside down, as she does almost every time she uses it, no water spills out.  We have only used it for water.  We borrowed an Avent sippy cup and she had a harder time getting the water out with that than with this one.  It also seems that she likes the nipple-like maliability of the spout, and it has so far held up against her sharp little teeth gnawing on it.  If you buy this make sure you know what you\'re getting - the Training Cup has the nipple-like spout and the Drinking Cup has the stiff spout, although they look almost exactly the same.  I\'m very glad that I have this cup and I highly recommend it.  It\'s also good knowing that there aren\'t any hormone-disrupting chemicals leaching into the water.",5
"Born Free Trainer Cup, Blue","You have to bite the tip to get the water out. For a baby who just graduates from bottles, they suck the tip the same way as they suck the nipples- They won\'t bite it. So it is impossible for a baby to get water from it. My daughter is 18 months when I got this for her, and she never get any water out of it. It is a major design flaw.",1
Born Free Stage 2 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"I have born free stage 1 nipples that came with the bottles, and these seem even softer, which i thought was strange. It\'s not a good thing or a bad thing though, just an observation. These nipples are great for my 15 week old. I noticed he was getting fussy while eating, and I think he wasn\'t getting milk out fast enough. Ever since he\'s used these, he finishes his bottle in half the time it used to take, and he\'s happier!",5
Born Free Stage 2 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"My kiddos would only use this brand of bottles and let me tell you, they are hard to find.  So thank goodness Amazon carries them.  My only grip is that they are more expensive than other brands.",4
Born Free Stage 2 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"Let me be clear - the product deserves 5 stars...my experience with BabyHaven deserves NO STARS.I bought 5 packs of these Born Free bottle nipples at $3.13 a pack.  The total weight for all 5 packs came to 4 ounces.  This was shipped from the BabyHaven store in California to my house in Maryland.  Regular shipping was $7.95.  I requested two day shipping and they charged me $99.00!!!!  You read that number right.Now, I thought this HAD to be a mistake.  A typo.  I emailed their customer service, and they confirmed that the charge is legit.  I do 100% acknowledge that I should have noticed this before clicking the confirm button and not after my card was charged.  I didn\'t.  That\'s my oversight, but any normal, rational human would realize that the shipping charge is completely unworthy of the size and weight of the product.  This was not being shipped overseas,  The customer service rep was NOT helpful and did not budge on an offer to credit me the fee or at the very least, give me a credit to their store.  I felt that they took advantage of my oversight and will never order another product from them again.Very disgusted,sweedon",1
Born Free Stage 2 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"The nipples are standard, sturdy and I started my son on level 2 when he was fussing with the bottle because he wanted a faster flow.  He was choking with it and it was time to advance him.",5
Born Free Stage 2 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,"My baby made a smart choice when choosing Born Free bottles, as we\'ve experienced nothing but good since we\'ve started them nearly 5 months ago! These nipples are just as good a quality, and Born Free has become a trusted brand for me. We have just recently started the stage 2 nipples, and I can see a difference right away, so he definitely was ready for the next stage up!",5
Graco Family Tree Highchair,"I bought this highchair when I was pregnant & have only lightly used it so this review may change after our baby is older.Out of the gate I have to say one of the major selling point of this highchair is that it folds up thin to be stored ""anywhere"".  It may be thin but it\'s still big (tall & wide versus thickness)!  I have had trouble finding a place to store it until I need it daily.  When open it has a large footprint.  I know this is to prevent tipping but I trip over it constantly.  It also makes it virtually impossible to leave out (unfolded).This highchair has many features, a few took me months to figure out.  The highchair height is adjustable, which is great, though I wish it went higher.  My older child pointed out that it lowers to a level great for someone with disabilities.  It also has a feature which tips the back of the highchair back.  I have read reviews that this as a wasteful feature but I disagree!  Because this highchair has a great 5-point harness we are able to put our 2 month old in it with the back tipped.  She is able to enjoy being with us at the table when we are eating, crafting, etc.  It might also be handy for someone with arthritis because you can bottle feed while in this position with one hand.There are multiple trays.  The bar over the knees, which hold the actual tray, has tray like compartments.  The tray has a tray on top that can be snapped off for cleaning while leaving behind the actual tray.  The tray & bar have buttons that confused us.  We could tell the could be removed but never knew for what.  We later learned that Graco sells toys which snap into these spots.  This highchair did not come with any toys & the toys I have seen for sale weren\'t that appealing, but it is a neat feature (they are interchangeable with other Graco products).My biggest complaint about this highchair is that it is a pain to open & close.  The first few times I used it I had to read the manual because I couldn\'t figure it out!  Each button is a bright red so they were easy to find.  The problem I had was folding down the leg bar.  It never wants to move because it is very stiff which lead me to believe I was doing something wrong.  Everything that moves on this highchair, besides the tray, is very stiff.  I am hoping this gets better with use.",4

Summer Infant Extra Camera for Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor,This video monitor has been the best! Works wonderful both during the day and at night!! Definitely worth the cost.,5
Summer Infant Extra Camera for Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor,Very good for the money I bought extra camera and I can watch both children.....,5
Summer Infant Extra Camera for Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor,This product saved me some money. After having another child my wife and i needed another set of eyes for the newborn.  We already had a camera in our first child\'s room.  And since the Summer monitor has an A-B channel switch we set one camera on channel A and the other on channel B.  We saved about $75 by not purchasing an additional monitor.  There is very little interference in the reception even with the additional channel use.  I would suggest this product to anyone in a similar situation.,5
Summer Infant Extra Camera for Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor,"I love this product. It work perfect, even in the dark. It is great to keep an eye on your baby when he is sleeping or playing in the crib.It is the best choice !",5
Summer Infant Extra Camera for Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor,"I\'m purchasing this monitor to use with my elderly Mother.  She lives alone in a house right next door to us.  She\'s recently come home from having a stroke and I lived with her for several weeks.  According to doctor\'s etc. she can be left on her own.  But, of course, I\'m worried.  Hoping to use this system to set up a camera on each floor in her house so I can check on her from time to time.  I\'ve been told this system has excellent range....the distance between our homes is approximately 75 - 100 ft.  Wondering if anyone else has used this system, or one like it, for a similar reason (elder care).  If so, please email me at Jabalchin@aol.com  Thanks so much.  Will post an update after it\'s all set up and let you know if it works.",4
Summer Infant Extra Camera for Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor,So far very happy with the camera monitor....way worth the money.  My toddler just starting sleeping in a big girl bed and it\'s nice to be able to see if she gets out.  I will be using the extra camera in the new babies room.  Very clear picture.  The sound has some static in it but not enough for it to be a problem : ),5
Summer Infant Extra Camera for Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor,"We have two of these camera\'s.  One for each of our daughter\'s rooms.  You can see and hear well enough, but the problem with these is the static you hear on the receiver\'s.  Our room is about 30 ft from our daughter\'s rooms and at that distance the monitors get a lot of static.  Even if we just move in our bed sometimes it makes it worse.  The camera itself allows you to see when it\'s light or completely dark in the room.  The light on the top of the camera isn\'t too bright.  As far as durability, the first one we bought died after about 18 months.  We\'ll see how the two we have now hold up.  We just bought another camera set because we already had two monitors and just needed to replace the camera which was cheaper than buying a whole new set.  If the rooms are fairly close to each other then these work great, if you\'ve got a lot of walls or other obstructions between the receiver and camera, then you may have some issues with interference which manifests itself as loud sudden noises that could keep you up at night if you\'re a light sleeper.",3
Bebesounds Prenatal Gift With Headset,"We had such a great time with this product. We could here my daughter\'s heartbeat so clearly! We were not expecting much for the fact that this was so inexpensive. But it was close to what we would hear at the doctor\'s office. My husband and I would lay down and listen for a while. You do have to keep moving it to keep chasing the heart beat. Our daughter was a traveler! We would also put the speaker on my belly to talk to her and to read her books. This really made the pregnancy time a lot more fun! Plus, it was so comforting to hear her. I would sleep so much better at night after listening to her for a while. I would totally recommend this product!",5
Bugaboo Transport Bag,"Some have stated that this product is difficult to use, but I found it very easy to put the stroller into the bag. I felt comfortable that the stroller investment was protected while travelling on a plane. It served its purpose!!  Probably just frustrating that Bugaboo got us to buy ANOTHER one of their products AGAIN! :)",5
Bugaboo Transport Bag,How do you rate a product that you buy to keep another expensive product safe?  It did what it was supposed to do.  I was surprised at how heavy it was once packed....since you are not used to carrying the bugaboo in this manor.  I loved havinig the stroller at the other end of the trip and it came apart and went back together well.,4

Riley\'s Roses Pink and Sage Green Shabby Chic Floral Baby Girl Flower Bedding 9pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"Cheap fabric: very thin and probably wouldn\'t last long. Also the print is very muted/faded and looks nothing like the picture. I looked at other reviews prior to my purchase and decided to get this product. Some of the reviews said that the quality was good in consideration of the low price  but that is a joke. After I returned this product I got a  set from Target for less and it is much better quality. Do not get this product - you\'ll be dissapointed. I don\'t have crazy high standards either and I rarely leave such critical feedback, but in this case, it totally calls for it.",1
Riley\'s Roses Pink and Sage Green Shabby Chic Floral Baby Girl Flower Bedding 9pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"Do not let the picture fool you.  This was the worst quality bedding I have ever seen!  As for the ""soft muted tones"" forget it.  It looks like someone played color outside the lines and the pinks are not pink they are florescent.  One look even through the package and you can see how cheap the material is.  There is nothing soft about it.  The bumper would be completely useless if you are looking for it to stay up.  I would not let me worst enemy let alone my child sleep on this.  It is amazing what they can do with photography these days.  And as far as the return policy forget that to.  This company expects you to foot the bill to return it and they really do not care that they are selling low rate bedding.",1
Danielle\'s Daisies Flower Baby Girl Purple Floral Bedding 9pc Purple Crib Bedding Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"I ordered the Daisies Crib Bedding Collection and I am NOT satisfied.  The quality of the fabric is beyond horrible and the set isn\'t able to be broken down into single parts.  When I received the collection I thought it looked beautiful.  But that was the end of it.  It ""LOOKS"" beautiful.  Once washed it looked like a rats nest.  The wrinkles are unbelievable on the cheap fabric.  I can\'t believe I spent over $100 on this set.  If I could afford to mail it back, I would.  I will be sure to tell all my mommy friends that JoJo Designs is a horrible product and to not purchase anything from you.MelisaDissatisfied Customer",1

Miracle Blanket Beige with Green Trim,"This was recommended to me by a mother in my online chat group. I bought one when I was 7 months pregnant and after my daughter was born I used it all the time! I actually went and bought 2 more cause there were times when one was in the wash but she wouldn\'t sleep without this.  The only problem is that it only comes in one size and my daughter who was 9.5 lbs and 22 inches long at birth quickly grew too long for this, but she also stopped wanted to be swaddled so I guess its not a big deal she got too big.  Swaddling is great for newborns cause they jerk their arms and legs and it freaks them out and wakes them up.",4

I did use a diaper pail originally, but as baby gets older, there is just a need to throw the ""yucky"" ones in the outside trash.

In fact, my pail itself started to get pretty stinky, even when it was empty.  A couple sprays of this stuff on the diaper before it goes in the pail and life is good again.  I also use it as air freshener after particularly bad blow-outs.  You won\'t believe how well it works.  With my first child, I had to use this Baby Berry Blend, which is the strongest scent (and not berry scented -- that was apparently the name of the kid who inspired the scent.  It\'s kind of citrus-y. I like it.)  With my next kid, I changed to Flower Child, just because I was curious.  It is a nice scent; definitely feminine, but not overpowering.  A lot of upscale baby boutiques carry this and I would definitely recommend purchasing locally, if you can.  (In Salt Lake City - USA Baby.  In Dallas, Lone Star Baby & Kids.  Call around and you may find it near you, too.)  Ordering through Amazon is really hit and miss with this product.  Your transaction may be perfectly smooth, or you may wait a month.",5

Chicco Polly Highchair Splash Pattern - 05063803260070,"Buying this high chair was a big mistake.  If I could give it a no star review, I would.  Sure, it is  cute and has lots of features ... features that you do not need.  It is not necessary for a high chair you use three times a day to fold up compactly, nor is it necessary to have a reclining chair or one that has adjustable heights.  What is necessary is to have a high chair that is easy to clean and that has an easy to use tray.  The Chicco Polly lacks both of these requirements.  The chair pads are not machine washable and get gross very quickly.  It\'s a real pain to wipe them down every day, and I never feel like they get truly clean.  The tray is also a problem.  First, it is very hard to get on the highchair, even using two hands.  Secondly, the tray ""covers"" may be dishwasher safe, but they do not fit in my average size dishwasher.  Moreover, the tray ""covers"" actually do not cover the whole tray, so you end up having to handwash two big, cumbersome pieces at least once a day.  In addition, even though my daughter is 13 months old, the tray is still too high (and not adjustable) for her to easily feed herself.  Not a good product at all.  An expensive mistake.",1
439 Red BeBe Amore Umbrella Stroller,The Red Bebe Amore stroller I ordered from Amazon never arrived!The shipping said 3-5 days. I ordered it on Nov. 29th and it still has not arrived.

Kidco Bath Safety Rail,"We bought this for our 2 yr old who wanted to get in and out of the tub by himself.  Although it serves its purpose very well, please be sure that your tub does not have a lip at the top or slant in the upper 4-6 inches or else it won\'t work well, if at all.It makes a nice sturdy grip for our son and makes bathtime much safer in our house.  It supports him with no problems, but is NOT made for adults.  It installs very quickly and comes off easily for cleaning.  It has been almost a year and the suction cups are still going strong and it still looks new.Overall, it has been a wonderful addition to our home.  A great product.",5
Kidco Bath Safety Rail,"This product seems sturdy and it has a great design.  Unfortunately, the slight curve of my bathtub is just too much for the suction cups to work with.  I\'m disappointed because it really did look like it would be great for my DD as she gets in and out of the tub.  Just be careful if your bathtub is non-standard, this might not work!",4
Kidco Bath Safety Rail,We bought this for our child\'s tub safety. It may have worked better had the outside of our tub were flat where the suction cup was placed. It seemed like suction on the middle cup was great but the side cups were just awful. One didn\'t stick at all and the suction power of the other was EASILY broken. VERY wobbly when we managed to get all cups on at once. Would NOT recommend. Shipping was fast though...,1

KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this but I am really glad I did! I first bought one of the storage bags that suction to the tile-the bag was too big and it didn\'t suction good.This storage basket is perfect. I have it pushed all the way to the back of the tub and it stays there.  It is big enough to hold all her toys and even the soap.  I don\'t let her play directly with it or push up on it like I saw some of the other people do. I use it only for storage. Overall, great product and definetly better than any of the suction cup based storage.",4

KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,Everything I was hoping for!  Holds lots of toys and I like that the slots allow everything to dry out afterwards.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"For all those little bath time toys, this finally holds them all nicely and allows them to dry. So easy to put together and it comes with three dividers so you can make compartments. We use one compartment to hold the shampoos and body wash.  It\'s quite sturdy too.",5

KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,I bought this to replace a &#34;scoop&#34; net toy holder that I had. It was getting mold on it and was disgusting. This toy organizer is the opposite. It\'s wonderful! The water drains out quickly and the toys air dry. It\'s so much cleaner! My son also loves to play with it. He calls it a &#34;bridge&#34; and has loads of fun with it.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I bought this to use in a house we just moved in to because the storage container that we already owned that suctioned to the wall would not work on the tiles in this house. This product holds all the toys we own and drains well. We keep it in the far end of the tub (opposite the shower head), so that it\'s not in the way of the shower curtain when guests come. Would watch this with kids that may want to try to pull up to stand because it is definitely not meant for that. Great for what it does and what it costs.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I bought two of these for our kids\' tub. They are easy to adjust and they hold a lot of toys. We used to have a bath toy storage bag that suctioned to the wall. However, it constantly fell off the tile. My only issue is that some toys are too wide for the basket. It would be great if the company eventually made a slightly larger size to hold wider toys.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I don\'t have kids, I bought it just for myself cause all my hair products were on the floor all the time, and it works perfectly for me.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I got these for a wash tub in my mud room next to the dryer.  I wanted an easy place to store gloves and hats and such in the winter time that was easily accessible for my 9 year old son.  I couldn\'t find anything that was a nice tray that had hooks out the back that would just hook over the lip of the front of the tub, so these were what I went with.They do not adjust easily - I\'m assuming that\'s so that kids can\'t easily slide one side into the other and hurt themselves in the bathtub - but I still think there was some leeway there to make it slide easier for an adult without compromising the safety of a toddler in the tub - besides, if they\'re that young, odds are they won\'t be in the tub alone as good parenting would include not leaving toddlers in the tub without supervision...I got two of these for my laundry tub, and they fit in there quite well.  The dividers are just inserts and easy to move (and stay in place pretty well, they\'re slightly longer than the width and slide into the slots you see in the photo).  I wouldn\'t be storing very heavy stuff in here, but for the little things like hats, gloves, and a few screwdrivers, it worked just perfectly.Only reason I took one star off was because of the irritation of adjusting the width.  Other than that, it was a great deal.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I got this as a tub caddy for my bathroom - I hate those metal ones that claim they don\'t rust, and do. This holds my jumbo shampoo bottles, and everything I need. I like that it\'s plastic and drains well. My shower stays much cleaner with this.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I had one of those that stuck to the wall before. And while it was cute and went with my sons bathroom theme (frogs) it didn\'t hold anything. Then when you did try to get stuff out of it, it would fall off the wall. This is perfect. I put it at the back of the tub and my son can take out whatever he wants and clean up after his done.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I had one similar to this when my kids were tiny-- now they\'re not, and I got another one for grown up purposes. Why is it so hard to find this? It is buried in the kids and babies section, though its clean, simple lines make it a basic accessory for any  bathroom. The ones officially for adults that I found are metal, unpleasantly ornate, and more expensive. This is easier than the corner tension rod ones, as it can easily  be lifted out during tub cleaning, has nothing to rust, and no nooks and crannies behind it to build up mildew.  Turn it upside down, and it\'s useful when you\'re reading in the tub...",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,I have ad this thing for two years now. Just a little clorox and it\'s as good as new time after time.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I like this tray way better than any mesh bag option for storing bath toys. Adjustable, fits nicely on my tub, looks clean. It\'s easy for my girls, 18 months and 4 yrs, to get toys for themselves. I keep it at the end of the tub, under the faucet, which gives it the added bonus of protecting them from getting hurt on the faucet.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,I looked in store after store for one of these after buying something similar at a garage sale years ago. I have a small bathroom and the things that hang off the shower never seem to stay put. This is a great way to store your bath necessities. I love that it allows you to create &#34;compartments&#34;.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"In my kids bathroom the tiles are textured, so they can\'t hold suction cups. All the kids bathtub toy holders are held up by suction. This is the only holder I could find anywhere that was not. My 1 and 2 year old love it and call it their ""toy bridge"". It fits our tub perfectly, and seems to be able to fit any tub. It expands to the size you need. I have no complaints about this storage basket.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I really love this thing. It expands, is easy to clean, easy to hold everything, easy to take out and doesn\'t hold water. Great investment for the lifetime of a little person\'s childhood.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I really wanted this to be worth the money, but it isn\'t. In it\'s defense, I have a garden tub, and it isn\'t very secure when extended all the way.

KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,Its great. fits perfectly in my tub. can adjust to any size tub. my son loves it. easy to put all his toys away.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"It\'s hard to get too excited about a plastic organizer. It works as it is supposed to. I like that the dividers are moveable. It\'s not cute or pretty, but keeps the tub free from all the toys.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,It was able to adjust perfectly for my kids\' tub and so far it has been sturdy. Would recommend it.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,I use this for my everyday shower items. I have a clawfoot tub and needed something to hold my stuff. This is perfect. Had it for a few weeks now. No complaints,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I use this for storing items under my kitchen sink. It works great and is very sturdy. I haven\'t used it in a bath, but I\'m sure it would work fine for that also.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,I\'ve been searching for the perfect bathtub toy organizer and this is it! I was sick of the net bags that dont stay stuck on the wall and get yucky. This us great because the kids can just throw all the toys in easily after bath time and also have easy access to them as they sit in the tub.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,Love this product. My kids have so many bath toys and I was tired of taking them out of the tub each time. The kids have fun putting the toys back in here and it drains well. Organizer adjusts well to for different bathtubs. Highly recommend this product!,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"Not functional when you have two kids that you are giving a bath at the same time.  It takes up too much room. I know some may say that\'s gross, but it works best that way.",2
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,Pretty awesome.  My son loves to use it during bath time.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,Product is as described and I have not had any problems with it.  I am able to store all of my son\'s bath toys and they are able to air dry properly.  I also love the dividers provided which allow me to store the baby washes separately.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"Suction bath toy holders do not stick to my bathroom tiles.  I didn\'t want to get this toy holder for the longest time because I thought it looked bad.  The suction-cup holders are all so cute!  However, this is practical and in person, looks decent.  The construction of it won\'t stand up to major child-destruction but if you\'re supervising when kids are near it, you should get good use out of the item!  It definitely allows toys to drain well which is wonderful.  I\'ve also noticed that my child doesn\'t try to get to the faucet as much when toys are in the direct pathway.  I\'ll be selling my other bath toy holders and sticking with this!",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,The basket was a little bit of a pain to assemble because of the track placement but once assembled it is easy to slide around the tub and hold a good amount of toys.,4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,This basket is well designed and is very sturdy. The biggest complaint I read pertaining to bath baskets was the tendency of those held with suction cups to slip. This organizer certainly eliminates those problems and is hassle free. The dividers are nice and can be moved to accommodate whatever you want to place in it. We use them to separate toys from soap/shampoo. It can hold a decent amount of smaller toys/action figures.,4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,This basket is working well for holding the bath accessories we have for our daughter.  It makes the shower curtain a little awkward but it is worth it not to have everything in a bucket on the floor.,4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,this fits great in the bathtub and makes the toys look clean instead of being thrown all over my bathtub lol. Love it.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This is genius for keeping bath toys from clogging the bottom of the bathtub.  Kids love it, I love it.  Win-win",5

KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,,4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This is the best toy basket for the tub I have found.  My little one is 2-1/2 and I love it.  When it looks dirty I put it in the dishwasher and it is clean.  I love the way it sits (doesn\'t come off the side of the tub or the walls), no rust marks on tub, no mildew, if she hits her head it doesn\'t hurt her head.  When I need to shower it is firm enough to place on a towel on the floor without having to take out the toys and shampoo. It drains well and toys dry well in this also. I love it.  Best purchase and would make a great babyshower gift.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This is the best toy holder I\'ve used yet! Very sturdy and I love how it adjusted to fit my daughters standard size bathtub perfectly. It was kind of hard to adjust, but that\'s because it fits together snugly which helps keep it sturdy. My 2 yo really enjoys it because she can have all of her toys within arms reach :) I would buy again and I definitely recommend.Edit:4/22/13 - Still using this for my toddlers bath toys and no problems with it yet! Only issue I seem to have is we\'ve accumulated too many toys so it over flows. This toy basket beat my expectations.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,This is wonderful for holding those small bath toys that clutter up the bathtub. Our son\'s toys can all stay together and make the bathroom look messy.,4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This little bath basket works perfectly, looks good, is sturdy, and the price is right!  Love it!  Perfect for baby\'s toys and body washes.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This product fits the bathtub perfectly and holds a lot of toys.  I really like how you can divide it as needed  to keep everything organized.  We use it not only for toys but also for the baby\'s soap, etc.  It helps keep the bathtub looking clean and organized. And best of all, it doesn\'t fall off because it doesn\'t have suction cups!!!!  Love it.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This Product is cool. When it arrives you can put it right in the bath tub. I have a 4 year old, and we put all her bath toys in this and she can play in the tub and easily get to all her bath toys. It never falls in the tub when she uses it. And it is easy to remove when us adults need to shower or bath. This is perfect for kids. I highly recomend it to anyone with kids and bath storage needs.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,This storage basket has plenty of room and will fit any tub since it is adjustable.  There are slots so everything dries.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This storage basket was an upgrade from one that was &#34;supposed&#34; to stick to the wall.  I am pleased with it.  It fits in the tub exactly what the picture portrays.  Fits perfect in my regular size bathtub.  The water has plenty of opportunity to drain.  Fits a lot of toys, which is great.  I would definitely recommend it.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,This works great for our daughter bath toys.  I just wash it in the dish washer once in a while.  I have never had a problem with it.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"We had a corner toy holder made out of more of a fabric material that started getting mildew on it.  Even though it was towards the back of the tub and could dry and drain between baths, it still grew mildew.  Th mildew did not come off when washed and the toys in it started getting mildew on them, too.  I wanted something that was easy to clean and could drain easily.  This is all plastic so it is very easy to clean.  The whole thing drains out so water doesn\'t collect in it.  It is adjustable and easily fit in my tub.  Plus, I can move it in order to block my baby from trying to get to the faucet.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"We had one of those hanging nets, that you suctioned to the wall.  It was always sliding off, and in the way when people came over and had to use the bathroom shower that our child uses to take her baths.  This is simple to just pick and move.It not only is a great storage unit, but our daughter uses it as part of her elaborate set up in the tub- its a prop.  Excellent product.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"We haven\'t tested it with water in the tub, but I have to say it adjusts easily and installs easily. seems really firm and secure fit, with plenty of drainage holes.  It took a little shoving to get it adjusted into place, my only fault is I wish it was a tad wider to better fit a leftover beach trip boat, but I don\'t think its a short coming.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"we use this to put our shampoo, and all bath needs in including back scrubber.  We place it in the back of the tub so while showering we have all our necessities accessible.  Very helpful and better than suction cup holders that always slip off the shower walls.  The Bath Storage Basket solved our problem.  Thank you",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"We\'ve had this for about 4 months now, and we love it. It is strong, has a lot of storage room and it was easy to &#34;put together&#34;.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"works great for storing little toys and keeping the kid stuff organized but doesnt stay well in our tub so had to adjust and set ontop of back part of tub.still happy with it, and my daughter enjoys having it since it takes up little room",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I received this today and was sad cuz it doesn\'t fit my tub. I have a garden tub and it wasn\'t long enough to fit across, otherwise I think I would\'ve liked it. My tub is 36 inches across in the middle and I could\'ve pushed it towards the front where it was around  31-32 inches but because it starts to round out it wasn\'t stable there and would fall easily if moved a little towards the center.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This is a great idea.  It keeps the toys out of the bath and provides a place for my daughter to pour from cup to cup without getting it all over the bathroom floor as it spills off the edge of the tub.  My only desire would be that it be made of sturdier plastic, but as is it works and we will see how long it lasts.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"It was a little bit difficult ""sliding"" together - the pieces kept getting stuck but otherwise was a great purchase.  I had been looking for one of these for a long time and it has come in very handy.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I wouldn\'t categorize this item as a toy of any kind. It is a nice storage container for a child\'s small bath toys. And because my son likes to line up things and pour water over them, it\'s a nice way for him to do that without the water being poured straight out of the bathtub. But, at the same time, it\'s a little too high for him to play with it while sitting down in the bath; He has to kneel.",3
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"We use this to hold the kid stuff for bath time.  It works exactly as described, and extends to fit our tub.  It\'s strong and holds a surprising amount of weight.  One note, it does get in the way of shower curtains if you\'re sharing the kid\'s tub with adults to shower.  You\'ll need to take it out or have an extra long shower curtain to drape over the side so you don\'t have water go everywhere (the shower curtain will prop up on the organizer and sometimes allow water to drain over the side of the tub.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"Item was as expected works well with our standard tub size holds all of babies shampoo, bubble bath and toys.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I like this product. I am a stay at home parent to a son who just turned 2 and another who\'s 9 months old, with another baby due in 2 months. So, I\'ve got my hands full, and they\'re only getting fuller. Before this product, I had to hold each individual toy and let the water drain out of them, and then put them away. Now, I can place all of the toys in here to drain out into the tub. It\'s one easy step, and it saves me several minutes, which is very important since I have little time and LOTS of tasks to do throughout the day. This has to be removed before someone can close the shower curtain and use the shower (and I\'m pretty sure I\'d forget it\'s there and trip over it if I TRIED to take a shower with it in there. So, we take it out and put it on the counter, take our showers, and put it back. It keeps our floor dry and keeps our bathroom looking neat. Oh, and it does help that my 2 year old is willing to help put his toys away in this because it\'s so easy for him to reach. I don\'t know if I ever got a divider... Maybe I accidentally threw it out. I only ever plan on using this for toys, anyway, though.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"Works great for our small bathroom. The basket wasn\'t quite big enough for all of her bath toys, but I didn\'t expect it to be. Just had to get rid of some of the older ones, which is never a bad thing :)",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"A lot of toys do fit into this organizer. However, it is very hard to keep the dividers in place and it can easily fall into the bath when slippery and moved from the straight across position.",2
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"Finally! Thank you to whom ever invented this product. It has saved me hours. So convenient, they should be in every kids bath tub in America. Tried the cute buckets with suction cups on the side that stuck to the wall, they suck. Buy this.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This bathtub organizer is awesome. You can slide it to fit any tub, and have the option to use the two dividers if you want to.  It is perfect for keeping baby toys, soaps, and shampoos at hand and uncluttered.  This also works for keeping pet bathing stuff at hand and nicely organized.  This is a must have for organizer freaks.  Very sturdy.  I like that its is made of plastic instead of metal because if it gets grimy you can toss it into the dishwasher and it won\'t rust.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I\'ve seen and used many tub toy holders over the years as a nanny, prior to becoming a mother.I knew coming into this mommy-gig that I\'d be hard pressed to find a holder I\'d like.Most use suction of some kind and the suction, I\'ve found, hardly ever stays put.I suppose folks like having the toys up and off to the side somewhere to save space, but if the tub you\'re using this in is primarily the kids\', then that\'s not much of a concern.Even if someone wants to take shower, just move the basket to the other end.I like that things have more space to air out and it acts a little bit as a blocking device to keep baby hands from the shampoo and bubble bath.It\'s as sturdy as any of its counterparts, but I wouldn\'t suggest a baby holding him/herself up with it.Overall, would buy again and recommend.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"We purchased two of these and it doesn\'t fit my kids tub. If you are going to order make sure your tub has a least a 3-4&#34; lip all the way around. If your tub is wide you have to stretch the organizer out which leaves it with very little support to hold any items, so it sags in the middle.",2
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,I have to take it out of the tub every time I give my son a bath because if he tries to push on it it moves and he will fall over. It needs to have some sort of mechanism to be able to stick in position so that is doesnt move around.,2
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"this is a great product not only for storage on the bathtub but you can also, place on the floor out of sight.  good for mamma and baby.  very quick delivery and assembly also!",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,This toy organizer can hold more toys than I thought it could when I ordered it.  It took about 30 seconds to put together and is easy to adjust.  It is also easy to clean.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,My babies love playing in the tub with lots of toys. I had the plastic kind that sticks to the wall but many times it would fall making a big noise and wouldn\'t even hold the light weight toys. So I ordered this basket after reading the reviews and I just love it. It is perfect! I was a little worried that it might look kinda cheap but NO. It looks clean and stays clean. It holds so many toys and adjusts very easily.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I had been searching for something to keep my son\'s toys in. I\'d read too many bad reviews on anything with suction cups, and we refused to drill holes in our tile to mount that frog basket. I came upon this, and decided to buy it based on the decent reviews.I will agree with those reviews. Since it\'s plastic, you can\'t expect miracles for sturdiness. However, it certainly fits the bill of what we were looking for. We wanted something to keep the toys, shampoo, and rinsing cup where they\'re handy but can drain nicely. We love that it adjusts, and the separaters are a nice plus.My son is 11 months and would definately want to use this as a means of climbing out of the tub, so we simply take it out and set it aside until we\'re done with his bath.I also like that it\'s not kid-themed, so we\'ll be able to use it for years without getting sick of duckies, froggies, or any other cutesy theme.",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"this is the best bath sorter, hands down. The ones that stick to the wall usually fall off. This product has held up for 2+ years and is a mommy favorite.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,This works perfectly. Fit our standard sized tub with no issues. I pushed it all the way to the back of the tub so the shower liner still works fine when my older kids shower.,5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"this thing is exactly what i hoped it would be and even surpassed my expectations a bit. it is adjustable to fit various tub widths, and the dividers are removable, so you can decide where you want them. the reason this is far superior to netted bath bags is because bath bags are usually very small which makes clean up annoying, plus they hold very little and tend to stay wet and so do toys inside. this thing is fantastic because it better drains the toys, and is very spacious. really, it\'s a no brainer. it seems, from the posts i have read, that the only issues people have with it involve them using it wrong. this is not a brace for a child to stand on/ use for standing support. duh. also, if you have a tub with sliding doors or weird measurements, it might not fit. also, duh. it is positioned slightly high, but that makes it perfect for a sitting parent to keep shampoo and soap bottles in to use during bath time. it does not serve as a bath table for a little guy. that being said, this is a very good idea for most people and i really am glad to have it because bath toy organization and clean up are way better in my house now.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I really like this product because I wanted something that was not going to rust in the shower, so I found this plastic storage basket that is great even for adults.  Lots of storage space for all you need in the bath.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I absolutely love the KidCo Bath Storage Basket! I have had the mesh storage nets for my daughter\'s bath toys, and they get mildewy and nasty. I\'ve had two of the turtle scoops that stick to the wall, and although I think the concept is great, the plastic eventually wears out, and the turtle falls and cracks.This storage basket is amazing! First of all, my daughter can get out only the toys that she wants to play with and can pick up after herself at the end of each bath. It is expandable and will move to fit the size of your bathtub. It\'s very easy to clean. It holds many more toys than the previously mentioned bath toy storage options and now I don\'t have mermaids and squirty animals sitting all around the edge of my tub anymore, because they all fit! This basket is also priced super cheap. I wish I had bought this four years ago instead of dealing with the other inferior products!",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"Holds a good amount of toys, drains water so the kids can clean up after bath time and I don\'t have to double check that its not filled with water, no annoying suction cups that eventually lose their grip, great divider so they kids aren\'t fighting about the other is taking up all of the room in the tub, I just slide it to the front of the tub so its out of the way when I shower, it even has a built in soap dish. I also like that its while an simple so it blends in better with my &#34;adult&#34; decor oppose to a huge green plastic frog on my shower wall! The only negative thing is that it blocks the shower  curtain from closing all the way so you may wind up with some water on the floor after a shower. But you can always remove it while showering. And I spray it with bleach water every other week along with the toys and I\'ve never had a problem with mold. Great simple product.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,We like it a lot. Fits the tub perfectly and has enough space for all of our bath toys. I like t much better than toy holder with suction cups. Very happy with the purchase and glad I found it on Amazon!,5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","Roomy sure, but it should clip to the outside of the bag - now that would be really handy...",3
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red",This tiny little pouch is such a lifesaver living in nyc where everything is dirty. I attach this to my stroller and keep teething toys and crackers clean and accessible. It works well with a pacifier of course but we don\'t use one. I also appreciate the modern stripe print. It looks pretty hot on my all black stroller (most importantly!),5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red",Looks good hanging off the side of the nappy (diaper) bag and you always know where the dummy (pacifier) is.,5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","It\'s a nice pouch and holds 1-2 pacifiers.  However, the snap keeps coming undone.  It\'s intended to be hooked onto a diaper bag or purse, so it\'s pretty important that it stays put!",3
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","Does its job, and it\'s the cutest thing, but it comes unclipped on the regular which is frustrating... Other than that, it\'s golden.",3
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","This is great to have strapped to the diaper bag! My only issue is that the snap makes it easy on, but easy off as well. This is actually my second one because our first one came off on one of our travels without us realizing it.",4
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","It\'s functional, but really small and so it doesn\'t fit 2 pacifiers, and doesn\'t have the antimicrobial lining. Probably not worth the money.",3
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","I absolutely love this paci holder! It\'s too bad my son doesn\'t take a paci anymore, but I recommend 100%",5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red",I love this little pacifier bag. It\'s cute and functional. I keep one in my diaper bag and attach another one to the car seat or the stroller. Very helpful to keep your pacifiers handy in style.,5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red",Thank the item arrived very quickly.I can think of a multitude of uses for this little bag.,4
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","the pacifier pocket is a great idea!i never know where to put the pacifier so it stays clean and protected but is still easily accessible when i need it. the interior of the pocket is lined in antimicrobial fabric so it\'s really nice knowing it\'s not harboring bacteria. and i like that i can snap it off and on so i can snap it to my diaper bag, the stroller etc.when not being used for a pacifier, it would be great to hold my baby\'s favorite small, wooden teether.once we\'re past that stage and not using this for things the baby will put in her mouth, i will probably use this to hold other small necessities in my bag - i\'m thinking band-aids and a few single-use first aid items would be handy!! or even my keys...it\'s nice that it can serve other purposes as time marches on!",5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red",i got this in my baby registry. i can\'t say that i won\'t use it. i will. you just have to be careful as the clasp closer isn\'t so strong. i can see it getting lost in my future.,3
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","Cute and practical! I\'m able to fit two GumDrop pacifiers in this pouch and slip it into my diaper bag or purse, it\'s very handy.  I love that it\'s anti-microbial and reusable, my snack-sized Ziploc bag pacifier storage days are over, and I have even more peace of mind about cleanliness. I haven\'t had a problem with the pocket detaching or falling off of my bag, I use a Skip Hop diaper bag with two interior key hooks, and I attach the pacifier pocket to one of those. So there is never a problem with detachment or locating the pocket, from personal experience.  I can also maneuver the zipper with one hand, which is always nice when you have an infant in your arms.",5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red",We used this for about 1 month...it would not stay snapped to our diaper bag so we had to store it inside the bag.  Then the zipper broke!  So now I am going to buy a different brand to replace it. Not happy with the quality. Could barely fit 2 Nuk pacifiers in it.,2
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","We clipped this to our skip hop changing bag and lost it n our first outing with in 20 minutes. It should velcro not snap. Don\'t waste your money. Lost this, plus pacifier and clip.. $$$$$$$$ I don\'t need to repeat that loss again!",2
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","It\'s convenient, it keeps the pacifier clean, and I always know where to find it since it clips to the carry strap of my diaper bag (or anywhere, really).",5
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","I bought this because I like Skip Hop and my JJ Cole\'s velcro was coming off of my other pacy holder. It was such a disappointment. The zippered holder works great but if you want to hang it on your diaper bag forget it! After about 2-3 weeks of using it you will be in a store with a screaming child and you look to where the pacy holder should be just to find it not there because it fell off on the way to the car. But if you are just going to shove it in your bag then I would choose this one over the rest, but if you want an easily accessible one to attach to your bag\'s straps choose another one.",2
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","This pocket is great for storing pacifiers and keeping them clean.  However, the snap does not stay attached so it has come off the diaper bag or car seat several times - something to watch for!",3
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red","I purchased this and was only able to use it for a short two weeks, until it fell off of my diaper bag and is lost already!!  Other people\'s reviews stated that it fell off too easily, and I should have listened.  The strap that attaches it to the diaper bag closes with a snap, which is not AT ALL strong enough.  It falls off just from brushing against it.  Otherwise, it would have been a great accessory.",1
"Kidz Delight Interactive Animal Cubes, Blue","I got this toy for my child but after opening it when I pressed down on the block I found that the sound of the animal didn\'t match the picture no matter what I tried it never corrisponded. I looked in the manual and it said that if this happens try changing the batteries...I did and same thing. I was going to send this back but I lost the return info in all the Christmas wrapping. I took the thing apart and found that two of the wires were crossed. So I took my soldering iron and swapped them and the toy works fine now. Its too bad that companies can\'t do a little better quality check. how hard would it be to check to see if the monkey goes ""moo""??",3

"Kidz Delight Datamax II, Silver",The Datamax II was a big disappointment.  The first one we ordered for our son\'s 8th birthday showed up with the display not working.  We exchanged it for another and the display on the replacement went bad after 2 days.  We won\'t be ordering another.,1

"Kidz Delight Silly Sam the Talking Broom, Green",It is hard to find a sutible broom for kids these days. I love this broom. My son sweeps even more with this broom. Sam talks and encourages him... KayB Toys has it for $10 though... This one is perfect. Even at $20 he plays with this more than his more expensive toys...It\'s great...,5

Baby Photo Album Record-A-Message,"My mother gave us this book after our son was born.  We enjoyed filling it up with pictures, which we did pretty quickly.  One of our favorite first pictures was a picture of my husband holding our son in the hospital bed across from me.  I woke up and saw he was asleep and cradling our son in his arms after being awake for our 26 hours of labor and delivery.  It\'s one of our favorite first pictures.  We were able to record the sweet little baby cry for our son too a few days later at home.  It was nice to be able to preserve that through this photo album.  This album is a great gift for new parents and a great way to preserve special memories through the voice recording and also through your favorite pictures.  Today, there are so many different kinds of technology available to video/record for memories too.  At the same time, it\'s special to have something you can look back on and actually hold in your hands.  Our son loves to look back through his baby book and hear his cry when he was so little.  It means a lot to him also to have something he can hold in his hands and look through.  That\'s something more modern technology doesn\'t always provide that\'s priceless.",5
Lipper High Chair - Pecan,The high chair is put together very well.  I was disappointed in the pecan color.  The advertisement showed a lighter pecan.,4
"Gift Mark Child\'s Upholstered Chair with Ottoman, Pink",Super cute! Looks even better in person. Great quality. Purchased for my grand daughter for Christmas - it should last her several years to come.,5
Pink Lullawrap,"The Lullawrap was recommended to me by a friend and was one of the only things I bought for my daughter before she was born.  I wasn\'t that impressed with it until I actually used it.  What a GREAT swaddle blanket.  It is the only one we use!  It\'s soft and big and has a little give in it so that we can swaddle tightly and feel comfortable about it.  Also, the simplicity of its design (white) photographs well in the first weeks when the baby stayed swaddled most of the time and appeared in countless photos.  I actually had to buy a second as soon as the first one needed to be washed because we couldn\'t swaddle her well in anything else and thus, we had a hard time putting her to sleep. This blanket was the staple of staple baby items used during our first month home with our new baby.  I highly recommend it to any new parent.",5
Graco Lovin Hug Easy Entry Open Top/Curved Frame Swing,"This swing does what it is supposed to do. It swings. It also plays different types of music and sounds. However, it eats batteries like crazy! I do like that is has different sitting positions. Not really for a baby under 8 pounds.",3
"Graco Safe Seat Infant Car Seat, Rittenhouse","We liked it but our 8 month old is now in a bigger seat, a Britax rear facing seat not a carrier, shes almost 20 lbs and this thing was getting way to heavy to carry with her in it. But it was great while we used it.",5
Evenflo Elan Breast Pad w/Lanolin,"I love!! these nursing pads. The shape is much more comfortable than the ""contoured"" kind. Because of the flat sides, they aren\'t as noticeable under clothing as other nursing pads can be. Plus, the lanolin already on them? Genius. Even after nursing for 8 months, there are still days that are more sensitive than others and not having to fumble with the lanolin separately is just so convenient. I have a hard time finding these in stores, so I buy them in bulk whenever I do.",5
Hello Baby Phone,Perfect for my 6 month old granddaughter. It fits good in her little hands. She loves to play with it. But still wants to play with our cell phones! Had not doubt about that. But at least she has her own.,5
Hello Baby Phone,"This was given to my daughter as a gift when she was 5 months old and she loved it straight off the bat. As another reviewer mentioned, it\'s a perfect size for little hands and the thumb hole rotary makes it even easier for her to hold. I don\'t think she has any idea it\'s supposed to look like a phone but with all the different sounds and textures it still holds her attention.",5
"Graco MetroLite Stroller, Rittenhouse",Our little Jasper loves his stroller. Isn\'t it enough to rate it five stars? Not to mention its reasonable price.,5
"Graco MetroLite Stroller, Rittenhouse","I love this Graco stroller for all the mommy-friendly features and the fact that this model is lighter than most. It folds a sits upright is a compact fashion when not in use.UPDATE: 19 months later and this stroller is going strong and still looks great. No damage, brakes work, steering is still excellent. Most importantly, it has grown with our child from newborn to toddler and I didn\'t have to remove any bassinet attachments or buy new pieces to size it up (unlike those $1200 jobs!)",5
Cloud B Pointelle Cotton LullaBag - Large Color: Pink,"I like the material of this sleepsack, both breathable and warm as advertised. However it is sized quite large and I would not use it for a newborn. The ""large"" for 6-18 mos. was just about right for my son starting at 1 yr. (~18-20 lbs. at the time). The roominess in the legs is great for older babies, and my son (now 15 mos.) sleeps well in it.I think the designers could have done better by making the top part (above the waist) less roomy so that a baby at the small end is not ""swimming"" in it. My favorite sleepsack design is a Kiddopotamus fleece sleepsack where the zipper goes along the bottom and ends just under the baby\'s armpit on one side. The top closes with strong velcro tabs across the top of each shoulder. This means no tab to chew on and a good fit on top.With the Lullabag tab right by the chin, my son is constantly chewing on the cloth tab meant to cover the zipper -- which pretty much robs it of ""hand-me-down"" worthiness. The velcro used to hold down the tab is very flimsy and I\'ve had to re-sew the one on the tab as my son chewed thru the thread holding it on.The advertised sizing (not shown in product features) is a better guide than the target age given in months.Small (1-6 mos.)= height up to 28"" (71cm); weight 10-18 lbs. (5-8 kg)Large (6-18 mos.)= height 28-35"" (71-89cm); weight 18-28 lbs. (8-13 kg)I\'d give it 5 stars if it weren\'t for the flimsy velcro and placement of the tab over the zipper.",4

Cloud B Pointelle Cotton LullaBag - Pink (Small),"We used it for our baby from 0 to almost 7 months. This thing is great. We did not have to cover the baby with a blanket many times per night, neither did we worry about SIDS. It is thick(like several layers) cotton sack. The velcro closure stopped working after multiple washes, but still this sack does its job. So, we bought a larger size of cloud b for 6-18mo when the baby outgrew this one.",5
Cloud B Pointelle Cotton LullaBag - Pink (Small),"We live in San Diego and although it doesn\'t ever get below freezing, it does get quite cold, especially for a baby who doesn\'t have covers to keep warm.  It\'s super soft and cozy and I had both sizes in blue for my Son and purchased both sizes in pink for my Daughter.  Worth every penny!",5
Cloud B Pointelle Cotton LullaBag - Pink (Small),Absolutely the best baby product!  Our 15 month old daughter has been sleeping in a Lullabag since 3 months old.  We all rest easy knowing that she won\'t wiggle out of her covers and get cold in the middle of the night.  I give Lullabags to all my friends as baby shower gifts.,5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","I did a lot of research before purchasing a pack n play/bassinet. My older son slept in bed with us, and I really wanted to avoid that this time, yet I am more comfortable having my children in the room with me when they are infants. With my son, we borrowed a bassinet, which he outgrow quickly and never liked. I ultimately went with this one because of the design and extra features and I am glad I did. My daughter loves the vibration feature and nature sounds. I found the changing table very handy for the first few weeks with the constant changes. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. I read some reviews that complained about the diaper stacker not holding up and the wipes drying out, but I have not had these issues. I always fill up the diaper stacker and refill the wipes holder. My daughter doesn\'t have a nursery (we will give her our older son\'s nursery and move him to another room when she is about 6 months), but this pack n play has everything that we\'ve needed. I am also glad I chose it over a traditional bassinet, as my daughter is tall and she would likely have already outgrown a traditional bassinet, but we can keep her in the bassinet part of the pack n play until 6 months (she is almost 3 months and only 11 lbs). I also love how it looks in our room....it blends in well and looks more sophisticated than other pack n plays. The canopy feature has also come in handy and we\'ve had no problems with it, as there is a TV mounted on the wall behind her pack n play and the canopy shades her from the light of the TV. We also sometimes throw a light receiving a blanket over the canopy to provide a little more darkness. Having such a function pack n play has made keeping our daughter in our room and not in our bed easy and convenient. I had no issues putting it together at all. It has made night-nursing very easy as with it pushed up against the bed, I am able to reach over and get my daughter out of it to nurse without even having to get out of bed. I also like that once we are down using the bassinet part, we can use it as a pack n play and playard.",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","We got it for our little one, he\'s been sleeping in it since he was born, and he\'s now 4 months, it was easy to put together, good size, and the colors are perfect for any gender. I didnt really use the changing pad on this, cause baby would roll to the side, so I just detached it. and the little canopy its just ok, i just it just to entretain my baby with the bear hanging from it. I cant wait to use the playard and see our baby sitting in it playing with his toys.",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","Excelente producto, muy buena calidad y facil de armar. Cumple con todas las normas de seguridad, el sitema musical funciona muy bien. Muy buenas instrucciones, recomendado!!",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle",Love the look of it and is pretty practical. The only downside is that the changing table never lays completely flat.,3
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle",Perfect to start my newborn in! She sleeps in my room with me and a regular bassinet they grow out of so fast! So this bassinet is bigger so she can stay in longer. They changing table being connected is great to! It would of been too much for me to get up in the middle of the night and go to the baby room across the house to change her. Also I have a 2 year old that rooms right next to the baby room so the crying in the middle of the night would wake her up and that would not be good! Vibration and nature sounds are a plus also! Love the design too!,5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","This just arrived, our baby hasn\'t yet, but I do have some comments on the instructions.  If you plan to use the bassinet first, IGNORE the instructions to install the mattress!  It snaps in four places and velcros in two so it\'s kind of difficult only to turn the page and learn you use the same mattress/pad for the bassinet, so take it back out.So other than being a little complicated to assemble, I\'m very happy with it so far.  I did a lot of research and they only make a few models with the higher changing table.  I\'m 6\' and my husband is 6\' 7&#34; so this was imperative.  We plan to use it on our main floor mostly for diaper changes, naps, and then a controlled environment when our child is older and we need to let dogs out or are otherwise distracted.  I also love that it is neutral and goes with our decor since it\'s now a prominent fixture in our living room.  Love that it holds diapers, wipes, and more.However, I don\'t know why it\'s called a Pack \'n Play, this thing is HEAVY.  I can\'t imagine us loading it up to take ANYWHERE.  I guess if we were going on vacation for a week but holy smokes.",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle",Very easy to put together. Beautiful colors and a nice high changing table so you don\'t break your back.  I would reccommend this item to anyone who has a little one.,5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","MUY BELLO Y GRANDE EL CORRALITO DEL BEBE, EL TIEMPO DE ENV&Iacute;O EXACTO TOTALMENTE RESPONSABLE. COMPRA SATISFECHA!! EXCELENTE MUY COMPLACIDA",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","Very useful and safe. The vibration mode is helpful as well, but the most important thing is that it is very safe. The changing station also helps with the back pain when changing the diapers.",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle",Bought as gift for a new parents. Parents very Pleased with gift and particlarly like Bassinet changing mat as very handy.,5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle",I don\'t remember pack and play\'s being so big! With my last baby we used one as well but i don\'t remember being so large. That isn\'t a bad thing in my mind. I like the shade and the fact that the changing station flips up out of the way.,4
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","I love this brand, is perfect, comfortable for the baby, would return to buy a thousand times more, the perfect colors and spectacular designs",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","I bought this Pack N Play to use when my 6 week old grandson is at my house. I searched for a long time to find something that I liked. Not just a place to put the baby, but something I liked to have in my family room. I hate having to choose pink or blue neither of which works with my decor. Why do I have to junk up my house with baby equipment that I hate. This is the perfect piece. It works with Adult decor and doesn\'t look like I have decided to have a daycare center in my house. Thanks Graco for thinking out of the box and offering stylish baby equipment. The bassinet and changer are perfect for our little man and it is foldable so that we can take it on the rode with us in the rv. I love it !!!!",5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","Like many reviewers have already stated, this would be a 5+ star product only if Graco had included a way to easily pack the bassinet option. I don\'t think the changer is as big of an issue for me as we stopped using that early on and you can change a baby anywhere. The bassinet is wonderful and works until the baby is about 15 lbs. Our little one is almost 4 months and still under 14 lbs. and we use this pack and play often enough to keep it packed in the trunk of our car. I am going to sorely miss it once she hits the weight limit. We have been creative and place the bassinet in a medium sized duffle bag along with pack and play sheets, swaddle, toys and any other gear we may need on the road. It would be fantastic if Graco provided a zip up bag for the bassinet/changer to accompany the pack and play. Overall very happy and hope to use it for many years (and children) to come!",4
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","This pack and play is SOOOO heavy and hard to put together. To top it off, it\'s made from materials that could possibly contribute to SIDS in a New Zealand study. The mattress materials are polyester and polyurethane foam. Polyurethane foam contains toxins that can possibly off-gas and can be VERY bad for a newborn or baby who is sleeping. I have not been able to find a travel crib that is made from natural non-toxic materials yet. This pack and play also reeked of plastic when I opened the box. That odor can\'t be good for a new baby. This product is also big and clunky and a total nightmare. I am sure it\'s all made in China too.",1
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","Hey gang.  My wife purchased the original PnP when we starting baby-ifying the house.  When we got it down stairs we realized pretty quickly that it was going to stick out like a sore thumb.  (Tradidtional baby-stuff colors, bright blue, pink, etc.)  Deciding that we didnt want our den to look like romper room (like the rest of the house) we chose this one.  Its perfect, its  still fun and it is just as functional as any of the other PnP\'s.  If fact, with the soothing sounds package and the mobile, it might even be more so.Hope this helps.",4
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","I\'ve only had this pack n play for about a week, but I love it so far.  The colors are really nice (carlisle), very gender neutral.  I absolutely love the changing table.  Its sturdy, large enough to hold my 7 month old son (18 pounds 28 inches), and seems comfortable enough for him.  It does not lean to one side with his weight, again seems very sturdy.  I\'ve seen other reviews mention that the wipes holder only holds a few wipes and they dry out.  I have not had the drying out issue and I\'d say it holds enough wipes for about a week which I think is plenty.  The diaper stacker seems sturdy and is very convenient. It probably holds about a dozen diapers. The two mesh ""cup holders"" are great for extras, I use one for diaper rash ointment and I keep the other one for hand sanitizer, a pacifier, and a small toy, to keep my hands clean and the little man busy during messy clean ups.  The changer is vinyl but I cover it with a waterproof flannel bassinet pad (Carter\'s awesome!).  Also, the changer can pivot out of the way and that can be operated with one hand which is great.At 7 months my son is sadly too big for the bassinet. I can\'t comment on the bassinet, the canopy, or the vibrate feature.  The night light with the music and nature sounds is nice.  The canopy seems like a great idea for shielding a napping baby from the TV or any other light source in the room.  I wish I had this since my little guy was a newborn it would of been so nice to have then.  I plan to use it for the next baby.One big negative (which is why I took a star away) the pad for the bassinet or floor of the pack n play is pretty thin which was a disappointment for the cost of this pack n play.  Its probably OK for occasional naps and play but I would not use it as a baby\'s main sleeping area.  This is too bad since I was hoping to use this as a bassinet in the bedroom for the next baby.  I\'ll either invest in different matress or get a real bassinet and keep this in the living room.Standard Graco pack n play sheets fit this... but its a tight fit (you want that for SIDS prevention though).  Carter\'s pack n play sheets do not fit.  My son loves playing with his toys in here when mom needs to do something for 15 minutes.  Overall a great buy and I\'d recommend it.  If Graco could make that pad a little thicker it would be perfect.",4
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle",The Playard with changer/basinette works well. We know our daughter and son-in-law will be visiting often. We plan to take care of our new granddaughter for them as well. The unit lets us keep all the items we need in one spot. It works for this newborn stage. Hopefully it will continue to as she grows. It seems well built and looks nice as well. The purchase went smoothly. The product arrived at time stated.,5
"Graco Silhouette Pack \'N Play Playard, Carlisle","We have Graco\'s Modern pack n\' play - Zurich model, but needed a 2nd one for our new place.  The bassinet and changing table features of both models are wonderful.  However, the Silhouette\'s changing table feels lower than the Modern\'s and so it\'s much harder on my back (I\'m 5\' 7\'\').  Also, the Silhouette\'s caddy is much less user friendly with smaller compartments and a built-in compartment for wipes, which is very impractical since its capacity is small and it\'s not air-tight so wipes would dry out anyways.  Most wipes have their own resealable packaging so this compartment is essentially useless.  The extra storage for diapers hanging below the Silhouette\'s caddy is helpful since the caddy compartments themselves are relatively small.  The caddy on the Modern Zurich model is much better. Both changing tables do tilt, but not so much that it bothers me.  Having a PIVOTING changing table was key - don\'t need to hassle with constantly having to remove or reinstall.  Also, having changing tables with higher weight limits was important since babies will quickly outgrow the 15 lbs weight limit of other models.  The dome feature of both models is also useful.  All in all, we\'re happy with both of our pack n\' plays because of their space saving features and price.  I give 4 stars instead of 5 because the changing table height (would be great if it could be adjustable), organizer design, and changing table tilt - all of which can hopefully be improved upon for future models.",4
"Graco Quattro Tour Duo Stroller, Rittenhouse","I bought this stroller a month ago and I love it. Its been easy to use, not too hard to fold and not too heavy considering its a double. The wheels are large enough to ensure a smooth ride for the three month old. I\'m as happy with it as I am with my Peg Pergo single stroller.",5
"Graco Quattro Tour Duo Stroller, Rittenhouse","This is an excellent stroller. It is a solid, high-quality, easy to maneuver, comfortable, stroller with nice features (cup and snack holders for both children, easy folding, parent cell-phone/key pouch, etc.) at a reasonable price. A couple of reviewers compared this Graco unfavorably to much, much more expensive strollers. Is it fair to compare a Toyota to a Bentley? If you have the money and want a Bentley, good for you, but don\'t buy a Toyota and complain about it.",5
"Graco Quattro Tour Duo Stroller, Rittenhouse","My family went to Disneyworld and got a chance to see all the different double strollers out there.  This stroller caught our eye, we had an old one and were looking to replace it.  We don\'t care for the side by side because it limits walking in stores and through isles.  We settled on the Graco Quatro.  It has plenty of cup and snack holders, storage space, a five point harness (for those Houdini children) and ergonomic handle bars.  It handles very well.  We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.  The only down side is the attached bar for a car seat in the front; your car seat may not lock into the bar, so we just leave the cup and snack holder in place and lay the infant in the back seat.",5
"Graco Quattro Tour Duo Stroller, Rittenhouse","We purchased this product for my two year old and newborn daughters.  It\'s great because it\'s compatible with the Snugride car seat we purchased for the our oldest so we didn\'t have to buy any special components or a whole new travel system to make it work for both of them.  Our oldest loves riding in the front or back seat and it\'s going to last us a LONG time since they can ride in it up to 50 lbs! The basket underneath holds a ton of stuff and is completely accessible at all times. And there are 6 cup holders and a handy carrying pouch for my keys, cell phone, or garage door opener for when we walk around the neighborhood.It is bulky and heavy, but that also makes it very sturdy when I\'m walking the girls and my large dogs together.  We call it our limo. Even though I am fairly short 5\' 2"", I have very little trouble lifting this into the back of my tall SUV.  However, it is a tight fit when the third row of seats is up, but it\'s doable. I expected this to be heavy and bulky because of it\'s purpose.  I wouldn\'t want a flimsy stroller to carry my precious family and all of our junk  - it just wouldn\'t suit our needs.I had ordered this same model stroller in a different pattern from another company and it had a frame alignment problem. THAT company wouldn\'t help me with the problem. So after much discussion with Graco, they gave me a refund and I ordered again, but this time through Amazon.  I felt much more confident in their customer service, and when you spend this much money on a stroller, it\'s worth the piece of mind!Overall the stroller is great and my kids, husband, and I love it!",5
Second Nature Nipple 2-pack,"I have nursed my son, but wanted to be able to bottle feed when I was not around. We have gone through so many nipples and my son refused every one. I had heard of these nipples through the birthing class at the military base. I couldn\'t find any in the local stores, so I was happy to find them here! My son took the bottle right away with these nipples. They are soft, and have many holes to mimic a real breast. The only problem is when he got older and started biting. The nipples tear, making them useless. Even with that, I highly recommend these to any nursing mom who wants to introduce bottles. Well worth it!!",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse",After 5 years and three boys later this chair will be passed along to someone else. We did replace the padding after the second child as I put it in the washer every week (a bit much) You can order a new pad on the Graco site or by phone. Def one of our better buys!,5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","We have used it daily for every meal for the past 3 months and it has been great.  It looks great, easy to wipe clean and machine wash if necessary.  My baby loves to be in it and play while I get things done.  I even took it into the bedroom to put clothes away and keep my baby near by.  It does fold up well, but I have not needed to do that.  When we travel, it will come along.  My kitchen is small and it does not have place so I just leave it in the middle of the room and push it out of the way when I need to.  My son is about 20 pounds now and it still looks great.  Honestly I wish I bought it sooner.  It lays back so he could have been in it before 3 months old.",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","This chair is beautiful, easy to clean and store.  Real fabric that is easy to remove and wash.  Arrived ready to go!",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","Received the High chair as a replacement for a recalled high chair.  It is great that it fold so slim and can be put out of the way easily.  But negatives out weigh the positives.  It is difficult to get clean.  The seat cover shows all the dirt and is machine washable, but it would be nice if I could wipe it down and not have to wash it weekly.  The tray insert is useless as it only covers the front and not the corners, so if you use the insert you still have to clean the tray! Also the ""Flowers"" that are in the corners of the try get food stuck in them and are pointless.  I have yet to see or hear of anything that attaches there?  Good High chair if your limited on space and need to store it easily, but terrible if you like easy clean-up!",3
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","The look of this high chair and also the ease of use should earn it 5 stars but unfortunately it does not have a waterproof/spillproof material and for that reason, I have to give it 1 star. If it\'s the prettiest chair out there and daily spills and splatters will not wipe clean it does me no good. The first day we received it, we put our little girl inside with a frozen yogurt and discovered that it would not wash clean. It took a ton of work to get that yogurt off the black fabric and also the black clasp and belt!!! I would definitely purchase this brand again but not in this style of fabric. Look for waterproof/spillproof material and NOT IN BLACK.",1
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","We love this highchair.  Its very comfortable, SUCH a beautiful design for boy or girl, and easy to wash.  My only bad thing to say is that the dishwasher safe tray NEVER fits in the dishwasher..its huge and it doesn\'t fit right in any dishwasher so if you are looking for a highchair with a easy dishwasher safe tray, probably not the best one.  But this chair makes up for it : )",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","I started using this chair when my son was about 4 months - as it reclines, i was able to used it for small periods of time as a recliner. Also, when I started giving him a bottle at around 6 months, I would sometimes just sit him on the chair, incline to the max and feed him on the chair. Tray is very spacious. I liked it that u can close it for storage, but truthfully, i only closed it when I had people over . The chair is efficient, but it is not particularly attractive. Now the big issue: the footprint when opened is huge!  If u have a large space, this might not be an issue, but although not a deal breaker, it bothered me enough that I am now ordering a Kekaroo.  I do believe this was the perfect chair from 4-7 months when my baby would stay still on recline position, but now the recline feature makes no difference and I do want a chair that will grow with him.",4
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","So, I haven\'t used it yet, my baby is still only 3 1/2 months, however I gave this 5 stars, since it was so easy to set up(ready to go out of box), looks easy to use, folds VERY slimly, and last but not least is THE prettiest high chair I have found(rittenhouse), and will be good with either a boy or girl(incase it\'s still around for my next baby).  I could not be happier!",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse",Love this chair.  Easy to fold & put up.  Easy to clean.  5 point harness keeps daughter in snugly.  And gorgeous material,5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse",This high chair performed just like I expected. The fabric is removeable and simple to launder. Wiping daily with a wet cloth works fine between washings. Our baby loved this chair and it pulled up to our table nicely. The adjustable heights were nice. We folded it up often to stand it in the corner when not in use.,5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse",I love this highchair. It has a great design. It stores away great in our small apartment and is still very durable. It is easy to set up and breakdown. The tray is easy to clean. Just all around great!,5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","Love everything about this high hair. Money well spent, love that I can toss cover in washer which I do about once a week, more frequently when baby was younger. This lasts from 6 mos to 2 yrs+. Also love this black and white pattern in my kitchen.",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","I slightly regret purchasing this highchair.  The areas where the chair legs join stick out quite far from the chair and are located high up on the chair.  She has hit her head on this area several times as I have been securing the straps when putting her into the chair.  I have now noticed the leg joints do not stick out so far in other chairs and the joints are not located so close to the area where the child\'s head will rest.Also, the chair is not well padded.  It was sometimes audible when she would bring her head back to rest between bites.  I placed a towel between the padding and the chair to alleviate the problem.On a positive note, the highchair has held up well and is easy to clean.  The straps are easily adjustable and I know she is safe and secure in the highchair (of course, she is always closely supervised).",3
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","This is our second highchair for our third child.  I despised our other chair, the Graco Harmony High Chair. I really like the Contempo chair.What I like:1) The print blends nicely with our kitchen decor.2) I love that there are two chair pads and I can wash them on gentle cycle in cold water and air dry.  They come out beautifully.  Being able to take the pad off allows for me to clean in all the underside nooks and crannies where things like cheerios hide.  Another review I read said that it is hard to clean but I disagree.  Taking the pads off is not intuitive but when the directions are followed to a T it is surprisingly easy.  We lost our instruction manual but I was able to print a new one from the GRACO webpage so I can refresh my memory if I need to.3)  This really does fold fairly flat - much needed for our small space.  We were even able to fold it and put it in our van and take it to our in-laws for the holidays last year.4)  We can pull this chair right up to our kitchen table when the tray isn\'t attached and our little guy loves being at the table with everybody.5)  There have been complaints about the straps.  I haven\'t had problems with the straps - they\'ve been fine.What I didn\'t like:1)  Our baby\'s arm kept getting caught between the chair and the top of the leg rests. He was never hurt - it just startled both of us! There are other reviews describing this same problem.  We resolved it my rolling up a receiving blanket and putting it in the space. Now that he is bigger - just turned one - it is no longer an issue for him. However, it should not have been an issue at all in the first place.  This issue is why I gave the chair four stars instead of five.  If Graco could fix this design flaw this would be an outstanding high chair.",4
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse",Great chair. easy to move around and setup. the only issue i have had so far is that my son had some scratches from not wearing cloths and being in the chair. the scratches were very monior. after more use the scratches stopped. and can now be in the chair without getting scratched.,4

"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","My little one has been using this chair for more than 2 years now and it has held up very well.  Although it did take me more than 6 months to figure out that I could take the whole fabric part off and wash it, it did wipe down easily without removing the whole thing.  I like the fact that the chair is sturdy and allow for a variety of both height adjustments as well as set back adjustments.  Good purchase.",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","My 1 year old, 26 lbs son loves this highchair and so do we. It adjusts in so many ways your child is guaranteed to be comfortable. Goes well with my decor also.",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","Love this highchair! Great purchase.Pros:- folds compact for easy storage, tray clicks on/off easily and slide back and forth well- love the design, pattern on the fabric- nice padding on the chair- love that the chair reclines, my baby liked this also the first couple of uses but now prefers to sit up and see what\'s happeningCons:- folding down the seat to close it is not easy to do, I often struggle while doing this- wish it could go just a little higher to accommodate pulling up to bar table heightI haven\'t washed the fabric yet so not sure how well it will stand up to a wash.",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","They were absolutely right about just pulling it out of the box and using it!! The chair is so easy to use, except the strapping mechanisms.. they get it in the way when trying to strap my daughter in.",4
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","This highchair is great - very comfortable, adjusts for infants to toddlers, easy to clean tray, folds nicely...but the seat is cloth, and it\'s pretty difficult to remove. Yes, it\'s machine washable, but it attaches to the chair in multiple, hard-to-reach places, and I don\'t have time to throw it in the wash every time my kid flings food around. Which is every meal. The seat wipes clean if you get to it right away, but wait til naptime and come back and it\'s too late, crusty remains that have to be machine washed. And then hung out to dry.",3
"Boppy Luxe Noggin Nest Head Support, Black Minky","Years ago it was common for babies to sleep on their stomach, but with the rise of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) parents are told to have their babies sleep on their backs.  As a result many babies develop a flat spot on the back of their head.  It\'s not harmful to development, but looks a bit odd and can worry parents.  I had this problem with my baby and with a month of using this pillow  began to notice a difference.  This is a great product.",5
"Boppy Luxe Noggin Nest Head Support, Black Minky","This is a great product.  Our son had torticollis, so his head and body kept falling to one side.  Once we used this in the swing and bouncer, he stayed straight.  It has also helped his flat spot.",5
Adorable Blue Spotted Puppy With Nap Time Blanket For Toddlers And Children,I haven\'t seen the product but my friend I had it shipped to seems to like it.. it looks to be cute..,5
Inglesina Twin Swift Stroller Blue,"I love my Inglesina Twin Swift, which nails just about everything on my wish-list for a double stroller. As wide as a standard wheelchair, it fits through pretty much all doors, is still wide enough to be comfortable to the kiddos, can turn on a dime (e.g., enter an elevator, and just swivel in place to face the other direction), isn\'t affected by a heavy child in one seat and a super-light one in the other, folds up about as small as my SINGLE Urban Jogger stroller (not as small as an umbrella single, but very small for a double), is easy to fold, can be steered one-handed, has 6 pairs of wheels so it rides quite smoothly (not as smoothly as a jogging stroller with 1-foot wheels, but surprisingly well), has ergonomically positioned handles, I don\'t kick the wheels with my feet as I\'m walking, and the two seats can recline independently.When I was researching these online I found conflicting information (sometimes on the same web page) as to whether it holds 35 or 45 pounds per seat. The answer in the product manual is 15 kilos (about 35 pounds). Unfortunately, my older daughter is already 30 pounds so I\'m hoping I can push the limit a little.Some online reviews complain about the hood/canopy coming off upon folding the stroller. I haven\'t noticed this, although I LOVE that it unclips so easily... sometimes we clip it where it belongs, sometimes extra high, sometimes extra low, and sometimes I detach the clip and my daughter pulls the cover down to her knees for an insulated-bubble effect while walking (which is great if you get stuck in the rain!).",5
Inglesina Twin Swift Stroller Blue,"I actually bought the 2006 version of this stroller in November 2007.  It broke last month (July 2008).  The lever that you push down to open it cracked in half and now the stroller cannot be opened.  I give it a one star for 2 reasons - 1.  It broke and is completely non-functional 2. It is still under warranty and Inglesina customer service has not adjudicated the case or returned any phone calls in 3 weeks so now I am stuck without my everyday double stroller.  Before the stroller broke, I thought it functioned ok.  I would have given it a 3 star.  Good qualities included easy to maneuver, fits through all doors, very compact when folded.  Downsides include very difficult to open (had to push really hard on the lever which is probably why it broke), kind of heavy for an umbrella stroller, seat back was sort of lumpy and looked uncomfortable, the backside of the hood is too short and does not stay buttoned when the seat is fully reclined and actually flaps in my sons face when he is fully reclined, and the seats are very narrow so if you have kids that are above average width, I do not recommend this stroller.  If Inglesina calls back in 1 week, I may change my review, but otherwise, I\'ll stick with my one star.",1
Potty Monkey,My son loves this potty monkey and attached to it real quick! He does not understand the concept of potty yet but I think that this will def. help him potty train much faster!,5
Potty Monkey,I love the Potty Monkey so much because my little girl really started getting interested in using the potty because of the monkey. Every time she has to go she takes her monkey with her. I keep the Monkey\'s little potty in the bathroom by her potty.,5
Potty Monkey,Potty monkey made me want to pull my hair out. That whiny high pitched voice. I can still hear it. Potty monkey ended up in the land where all the annoying toys go......in the bottom of the toy box. Save your money. And your sanity.,2
Potty Monkey,My child will play with it but as learning toy did not help her at all. Was not impressed with item.,2
Potty Monkey,"We got this for my son after we realized he was too comfortable with the diapers, despite the rash. We used the monkey in conjunction with a reward of a mint every time he went to the bathroom. The monkey kept him on schedule. The only issue I saw was that he would get annoyed with the monkey and ignore it. He later figured out how to turn it off. He was VERY excited when he got a talking monkey though, and he did take to it pretty fast. I\'d say this is going to work for most kids out there.",4
Potty Monkey,"Cute monkey and idea but too small, tail in the way, difficult to change settings, has no effect on child as an incentive.  The book is somewhat helpful but way too long, padded with unnecessary repetition.",1
Potty Monkey,"This is so stinking cute (pun intended).  The monkey talks like a little child and reminds you every 30 or 60 minutes that it &#34;has to go potty&#34;.  It\'s requests get more urgent until finally it says that you need to try better next time. :)  The first few days my 3 year old son (who is all about trucks and trains and not dolls or stuffed animals at all) loved it!  He\'d run to the bathroom to help the monkey go potty.  He loved flushing the monkey\'s potty.  He\'d cheer for it and was overall excited.  Day 4, however, he threw the monkey under the couch after a total fit and said, &#34;Hush monkey!&#34;  We\'ve since taken a break from the monkey and hope to rekindle the friendship very soon. ;)  The book for parents is helpful (different views--like recommending laxatives for kids to make them poop more, which is WEIRD to me)--but it does have some great information in it.  The kid book is precious!  My son still likes to read it regularly. Overall, this is a great idea, hopefully, it will work great for your child!",3
Potty Monkey,This is a fun educational toy that is needed by most every baby I\'ve met.,5
Potty Monkey,"The potty monkey is a wonderful training tool and does a fantastic job teaching them to go regularly without a parent having to constantly remind them. By teaching the monkey, they are empowered. Great product!",5
Potty Monkey,"It\'s cute and my son loves the potty that it comes with but... The monkey really needs to have a way to set it to automatically turn off at a certain time for bedtime, it also doesn\'t sit very well on the potty because its tail has a wire in it so it doesn\'t sit right, also underwear are too hard to get off, and the potty could be a little bigger so monkey sits easier. I probably would not buy this again as it has more cons than pros...",2
Potty Monkey,The monkey did not work for us.  The timer does not work.  And now the monkey announces he needs to go whenever ... it is like having another kid - trying to find his little potty so he won\'t keep announcing he has to go.  I would not recommend this product.,1
Potty Monkey,"Potty Monkey has been a great asset in the potty process, it is a very simple toy but seems to have helped our daughter at least grasp the concept of potty. It is also really cute!",5
Potty Monkey,"Product is cheaply made and accompanying kid\'s board book is a waste of paper. We had high hopes that this would be a quality purchase. Instead, I\'d like to pack it up and send it back already, and we just got it today. The velcro back opening won\'t stay shut. So, there\'s a gaping hole, with battery pack and cables easily accessible to the child. The 3-position switch inside has no &#34;on/off&#34; indicator, although the paperwork says it should. Reaching inside to set it is a bother, especially when you can\'t even know the setting. Further, the &#34;press here&#34; button on the monkey\'s hand that should work the electronics inside doesn\'t do so. Sorry to say that the product idea is far better than its execution. That said, the second book, the one for parents, contains good information on different approaches to potty training, and I would have purchased that alone had it been an option.",2
Potty Monkey,"I got this monkey because both my daughter and son were showing signs they were ready to potty train. They both have the same problem were they get involved with playing and forget to go, so the monkey works wonderfully.  The one downside is that the time settings are 30 min or 90 min, one is too long and the other too short for my son.  So I set it to the 90 min and then 30 min in, switch it to the 30 min setting.  I wish there was just a setting for one hour. otherwise it has worked better than I would have imagined!  I have recommended it to my brother for his son already :)",3
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"Absolutely love it. I debated it for weeks because of the price, but I am so glad I made the purchase. The first time my son saw it.. He walked over to the toilet & climbrd up on it using the potty stool & went in the potty!Also, after I placed the order I saw that the estimated delivery was almost a month away. I emailed them & asked if I could be upgraded to a faster shipping & that I would pay the differnece. I received an email back about an hour later saying they had shipped the product at no charge & that it would be delivered in 2 days.. & it was!",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,I love this potty stool.  it gives my special needs daughter the ability to climb up by her self and security. It gives her stability while she is focusing on being potty trained and it gives her the ability to access the toilet by herself to reinforce independence.,5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"We recently purchased this for our 3 year old son.  He is smaller than average, and although he was doing well with the little potty, it was going to be awhile before he could use the adult toilet.  I did a bit of research on other options, many of which seemed to have safety issues.  This was by far the most expensive, but worth it.  He used it immediately, without hesitation or instruction (and he had been nervous about the adult toilet before).  It is so sturdy, I feel very confident that it can be used without supervision.  And I know it will last until our younger child is ready to use it.  We also bought the baby bjorn toilet seat (since this does not have an accompanying seat), and it works great. The only downside is it is large, so if you have a small bathroom, this may not be for you.____By way of an update on my earlier review, we now have this in use with my 2 year old, who has been able to easily climb on to the toilet on his own with this for a few months (which isn\'t to say that he is trained yet, but we are working on it).  It has continued to exceed our expectations.  Its a great buy.",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"This is a more sturdy stool than any other one i had found. My son loves it. He climbs up on it, but doesnt know how to use the potty yet so he just uses it as a booster to climb on the toilet. Im sure that this will be very helpful when he finally does start using the potty! I have caught him in the bathroom sitting on the potty all on his own (with no coaching whatsoever) The only downside to this stool is that i live in an apartment with a VERY small bathroom. The stool tends to get in the way. Also everytime an adult uses the toilet they have to remove one of the handles which can be a pain. I leave one off all the time. Im not upset with the amount of money i spent on this stool, My son will be using it for years to come, and it gives him confidence to use the toilet on his own.",4
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"This is the perfect potty stool. A little pricey but well worth it. I\'ve tried 3 or 4 different stools and this is by far the safest.  I purchased this and the Kohler Transition toilet seat that had the integrated child seat, and between the two my 2 1/2 year old now loves to use the potty and she insists on going by herself.  With the sturdy handrails I know she is pretty safe from falling off the stool and I don\'t really worry when she uses the potty by herself.",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"I was really turned off by the price. $160 bucks (inc. shipping) is way more then I paid for any other potty training item to date. However, my husband and I were so worried about my son getting hurt, that I caved and bought this.Now for the great things:First, it is so easy to set up - only 3 pieces; 1 base and 2 side pieces which slide together like a puzzle. It was so easy that I put it together in 3 seconds - without my husband!Second, the potty stool itself is very durable. I was surprised by how heavy it was and am glad because that means no 2 1/2 year old carrying it around the house.Third, I love the handrails on each side. This means no falls! My son face planted into the toilet recently (on the two step Graco stool) which resulted in a doctor\'s visit.And fourth, my son immediately climbed on the wide platform, turned and pulled down his pants, then sat on the potty all by himself. He even smiled! Yay! So, lots of great things about this potty stool.So far, the only negatives are the price - kind of expensive (however for how heavy it is, I understand the pricing and it is made in the USA) - and that my son\'s tip toes touch (not his entire foot). We use the Baby Bjorn potty seat which is higher then most other potty seats so this could be part of the reason why his foot doesn\'t touch all the way.But being honest, I am so very glad we got this potty stool. I feel comfortable now letting my son have his bathroom door open during the night. I will be recommending this product to everyone!",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"My son has a form of dwarfism and is only 31 inches tall. This stool has been wonderful for him. He can independently go to the bathroom without asking for help, and it is very sturdy and safe. I would recommend this product to anyone who is beginning to potty train to those with children with disabilities.",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"The only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating is the price. I do think it is overpriced. That being said, I have had mine for 3 years with no issues. It cleans easily, is very heavy and sturdy, easy to assemble, and I don\'t have to move it to use the toilet. I just wish the price would come down as I would like to add a second one to another bathroom.",4
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"The Potty Stool is exactly as advertised.. safe and sturdy. We have a tiny bathroom and it is large, but we can move it fairly easily. My son, who was about 3 1/2 when we bought it,  feels very secure and comfortable using it and it has contributed to his independence. It is well worth the money, and I am certain it will last indefinitely, so can be passed on to others.",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"This is soooo worth the money. It is pricey, but my daughter has been using this stool since she was 1 yo. She is not 2 1/2 and loves having this safe stool to use the potty by herself. The arms and large base are great for little feet. If you get one stool, this should be it!",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It is safe, sturdy and cleans up easily. I actually throw it in the shower every few days for a hot rinse. I love that my baby is using the big potty! This has eliminated so much of the potty-training headaches!",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"Indeed this is not the cheapest potty stool on the market, but is worth every penny. It is very sturdy and stable, making it very comfortable and quick for a young toddler to get up on the big potty. There are enough things to worry about when toilet training, getting up on the potty should not be one of them. The railings give kids extra leverage when bearing down to poop. It\'s also easy to clean as it\'s made of several large, interlocking pieces of plastic. If you choose to forego a potty chair and start potty training on a regular toilet (like we did), this potty stool is a &#34;must&#34;.",5
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,"We started training our son probably too early with little potties, then I saw this and read some reviews here and on their own site, and thought why not try it.  Sure enough, my son instantly was curious, loved that he could climb up on his own and did his first BM in the toilet within a week!  The company also includes additional product info and tips inside.  Oh, and adults, you can still sit on the toilet!",5
Looney Tunes: Tweety Bird 8&quot; Plush Doll,The item arrived in a very timely manner ( early)  and is in excellent condition. Some of the stitching in the back of Tweety is not that perfect but he\'s just cute and loveable.,5
Looney Tunes: Tweety Bird 8&quot; Plush Doll,"I chose this rating because the item is small, the picture makes them item look larger than what it is.",2
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"Its a good brush, I really like that it can stand up right, I have no complains",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,The foam part at the top of the brush breaks down easily.  After only a week of having this brush the foam is already tearing apart.,2
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"This bottle brush works just fine and the suction cup is great, but the main wire that is the backbone of the brush is rather flimsy.  I cannot really scrub my larger Dr. Brown\'s bottles without bending it.  All in all, it does the job, but it could be stronger.",4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,Very useful and even cleaned the blue pipes of Dr. Brown bottles. Although it wore out in 5 months and I found it a bit expensive because there are cheaper brands in the market which are as good.,3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,Would  have given this brush 5 stars for cleaning..but am giving it only 3 stars because it does break with about 2 months of regular use. I am online today to purchase my 3rd brush..I love the way it cleans but the 2 issues I ran into are the bristles coming loose and falling out and the wire stem breaking..,3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"Great brush. Sturdy sponge, cleans baby bottles well. Haven\'t used the nipple cleaner yet so I can\'t say anything either way. Would buy again.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"This thing did a decent job at cleaning bottles, but the sponge fell apart after the first month.  I like the Philips Avent brush a lot better.",1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,This is my favorite bottle brush. I love that there is a place to stand it up. The brush lasts a lot longer then most. The price is good for what you get,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,This is a good bottle brush. We\'ve tried all sorts of brushes and this one seems to stay together better than most. It ended up falling apart after maybe a month. Highly recommended.,4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"As others have said, the wire stem is very flimsy.  The sponge part is also made with very cheap material and did not hold up well at all.  Overall a very poorly made product that only lasted a couple weeks.",1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,brush works well to clean bottles it just wears out in a sort period of time so we have gone through several. haven\'t found one that lasts any longer however...,3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,i do not like this one it fell apart with in a week of us the bristles fell out so i had to go get another one i would not recommend it to no one its a waste of money sorry,1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I like the fact that this brush has a soft foam on it compared to other brands. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because it bends way to easy. I feel like they could improve this by using thicker metal that connects the handle to bristles. The other nice feature about this brush is that it has a suction cup holder that keeps it upright and out of the way when your not using it.,4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"Does the job, however, the plastic and wire that attach at the base of the handle rot quickly and become unattached. I\'m on my second one and have found if you super glue it in the handle it works lol",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"MUY BELLO EL LAVA TETERO DEL BEBE, EL TIEMPO DE ENV&Iacute;O EXACTO TOTALMENTE RESPONSABLE. COMPRA SATISFECHA!! EXCELENTE MUY COMPLACIDA GRACIAS",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I bought this brush because I\'m a big fan of the Dr. Brown bottles.  I think this brush cleans the bottles very effectively until it starts to show wear and tear after a few months.  In all honesty, this brush lasted for about 8 months for me, but we did not use it daily to clean bottles, as most of the time we run the bottles through the dishwasher.  The sponge started to break down, which is not a big deal as sponges don\'t last too long, but the wire stem was pretty flimsy out of the box and just broke today.",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,great brush.  has all of the features you\'d want in a bottle brush rolled into one.  Only desire would be for the spongy part to be more resilient.  it seems to break down pretty quickly.  but I\'d still buy another because the other bottle brushes on the market are not good.,4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I\'ve only bought one other brush to compare (Munchkins Bottle Brush) so I wound up purchasing the Dr. Brown Bottle Brush again.PROSSoft bristles and the tip foamCONTip foam (because it is soft, it doesn\'t stay in tact)Munchkins foam was much more durable looking but the bristles were too harsh so I don\'t like using that one.  Even though the Dr. Brown bottle brush didn\'t hold up as well as I would\'ve liked and is more money, I still liked it better than the Munchkins one because that one is just too rigid and tough but that\'s my personal preference.",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I bought various bottle brushes from places like Target, and found them all to be pretty useless. I found the Munchkin brand to be extremely disappointing - it is designed to look like the Dr. Brown\'s bottle brush, but it just is terrible. This one is very effective and lasts longer than I expected (I\'ve been using it now for more than 6 weeks, every day, washing all the baby stuff several times per day). You can\'t lose with the Dr. Brown\'s bottle brush.",4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"Best bottle brush around, sticks to counter or sink, gets the nooks and crannies of the bottle/bottle parts and the best part is the nipple brush that is included in the base.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I\'ve been using this brush for my baby\'s Dr Browns bottles for over 5 months now and the sponge part is finally starting to fall apart a little bit but I think that was my fault for grabbing it in a wrong way. But over all good brush! I love it :] I\'ll be getting a new one!,4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"We are on our 3rd brush, it works great but the foam parts and the end tend to ware out after 2-3 weeks.",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,They wear out like any sponge. but they do work and are always at the ready when you need \'em. We\'re on our second one now.,3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"No matter what type of bottles you have, this is the one you want! The Sponge on top holds shape well, and the nipple nub on the bottom works very well, I hated using the nipple brush on others that was so stiff I felt as if I was going to rip the nipple apart.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"This is great!!  I don\'t have a baby but used it to wash all of my fine china and crystal in my china cabinet. Especially good for champagne flutes and wine glasses....very gentle, but thorough!!",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I got it as a shower gift, my baby is 4 weeks old and the thing broke already, just washing bottles, nothing special, buy the avent one instead, its great. sorry dr. browns, the bottles are great.",1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"Incidentally bought together, a little expensive",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I love this brush because it comes with a suction cup that helps keep the brush in place when not in use.  Even though my children are now 8 & 6 I still use it to clean their thermos\' and tumblers.  It reaches the bottoms of these cups more easily than a sponge.  I also use the Dr. Brown\'s Natural Flow Cleaning Brushes to clean the thermos\' and tumbler\'s straws.  I just can\'t live without them.,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,i like the sponge on top w brissles below & the nipple cleaner on the other end is great. REALLY like the stand-up aspect.,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"This brush is perfect for Dr. Brown and other bottles.  The nipple cleaner works great on our Dr. Brown nipples.  But the brush doesn\'t hold up that well and I am already on my second one in 6 mos.  Then again, I wash a lot of bottles and it is fairly cheap.",4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I like it. First, i was very surprised because the size of the brush but it is ok and works.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"My baby was born the middle of October 2011, and he was on a bottle right away, so I was constantly washing the bottles.  We have all the Dr. Brown\'s items (bottles, bottle warmer, sterilizer, etc), that it just made sense we bought this as well.  I would not recommend it.  I liked the fact that it had the stand for the brush to be put in while not in use.  At the beginning of January 2012, I ordered a new brush because the sponge on this one was tearing apart with all its use.  I bought the OXO Tot bottle brush with stand...it has a stand, and just bristles so nothing is going to tear apart.  So far, that brush is holding up well.",1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I see where people had a lot of issues and I barely purchased one because of them but I actually Love the brush. Mine has not torn up at all, I like the sponge tip for the bottom of the bottle floor. Especially for breastmilk which has a lot of fat... If you get a brush with a prickly brush head and not a sponge... then it misses areas on the bottom of the bottle floor. It will stay greasy no matter what liquid you use.. By the way, Palmolive Baby works magic and leaves the bottles squeaky clean.For hygiene purposes I switch my brush out monthly as I wash several bottles daily... I also ""after"" it dries out, I use a zip lock bag on the tip of it to keep it sterile.Palmolive Ultra, Baby Bottle, Toy, & Dish Wash Liquid 20 fl oz (591 ml)",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"This brush worked well to clean various sizes of baby bottles, breast pump parts and other feeding accessories for my baby boy. The sponge got nice and foamy with soap which made me feel like I was getting a thorough cleaning with all the suds. It was used daily, sometimes twice a day for just over three months when it basically snapped in half. I\'m pleased of the time I got out of it, maybe I am expecting too much for it to last longer but I have a different baby bottle brush I\'ve been using for almost 9 months that is still going strong.",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I love Dr. Brown\'sproducts and this is no exception! It smells great and leaves my baby\'s skin soft after bath time!,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,We bought one of these when our other bottle brush was old.The wire thing that the brush is on came out of the handle! We used it without the handle for a day before we went and bought another brush. This thing is cheap and horrble.,1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"This brush does not last more than a month. The XO brush is much better, you will spend a decent amount of money replacing these.",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I have been asked MANY TIMES what bottle brush I use. I have been through several and found one that has NEVER disappointed me. It\'s Dr. Browns Bottle Brush.This bottle brush has so many good features, where do I begin? Lots of bottle brushes have the sponge at the top, but since the top of the sponge in those bottles is flat, they do not reach the bottom of the bottle because of the metal that the sponge is stuck through. But Dr. Brown\'s sponge is slightly offset at the top, guaranteeing to get the bottom of the bottle.Another great thing about this bottle brush is that the handle takes some effort to bend. Unlike, many of the other handles I have seen, this one does not flex as much when it is used vigorously.Many other bottle brushes come with a separate nipple brush, but I just stick the sponge at the top of this one into the nipple, give it a twist, and I am good to go as far as cleanliness goes.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"unless you stick a paper towel in the base and dry it after every single use, it becomes moldy for some reason. I\'ve had four and they all have done the same thing, even when I think I\'ve dried them thoroughly. Otherwise, a good shape and great brush. I just hate that base.",3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I used this brush with my Dr. Brown\'s bottles and it lasted me about a month. The sponge at the tip got loose and before I knew it the whole thing came apart.Not very durable.,2
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I usually buy the bottle brushes that have sponge tips because I feel that they clean the surfaces better than a bristle brush but they usually don\'t last very long. I know that sponges are bacteria magnets but a short dip in boiling water usually makes me feel better. I will just microwave a cup of water till its pipping hot then submerge the tip for 2 minutes. Bottle brushes are usually a parents preference so pick a few that you may like and stick with the one that you like the best. Good luck,3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,If you buy dr brown bottles this cleaner is a must fits perfect and cleans the bottle completely it\'s awesome,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"We tried several different bottle systems with our newborn twins, as well as numerous different bottle brushes.  We finally settled on the Playtex Vent-aire bottles and the Dr. Brown\'s bottle brush has done an excellent job of cleaning these bottles, as well as all the other bottle systems that we tried.  For most bottle systems, the other brushes were a bit too wide and I didn\'t like getting sprayed with the bristles when pushing the brush in and out of the opening of the bottle.  The Dr. Brown brush has a sponge on the end which makes it easier for the brush to get in and out of bottles without getting sprayed in the face by the bristles.  I also like the pointed tip in the handle that cleans inside nipples--there are few other bottle brushes with this feature (if any).  So far, we\'ve used this brush MANY times a day (two babies, eight feedings a day per baby) for a month and the brush has not had any problems.  The sponge looks like it might wear out in another two weeks or so, and that\'s why I\'m ordering a replacement today.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,These are the only bottle brushes that last! We have gotten others that were tattered in less than a month. These last 4-6 months and are excellent!,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I have the Dr. Brown bottles so thought this would be perfect to clean them.  This brush is too soft and doesn\'t always do the job very well.  I think a stiffer brush is needed and that is what works for me.,3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"Much better than the cheaper versions. They tended to fall apart after a month of bottle and nipple washing. This one has made it 4 months far. It has lost a couple of bristles, but has held up well with daily washing.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"This is our third kid, so we are pretty much know what we will ACTUALLY use, and what we won\'t.  This bottle brush really helps us keep the nipples for the bottles clean, as well as reach the hard to clean areas of the bottles.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"Does the job, great for getting in the bottles.I would prefer without the sponge on top (because germs just collect) but haven\'t been blue to find one with just the bristles.",4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"These are the best brushes to use for the Dr. Brown bottles. It gets the bottles the cleanest. The only thing that I didn\'t like was that the top green sponge part does not hold up. I bought several of these throughout the washing of bottles for 15 months. Also, the nipple part isn\'t the best. I kept the nipple cleaner part of one brush for that purpose. Also, the suction didn\'t work very good. Needs to be better. Overall, I bought this style brush because it cleaned my bottles the best and I was willing to overlook the other very small flaws.",4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I bought this for my niece who is having a new baby, this was on her registry.  It looks fine but the baby is not here yet so we will have to wait and see.",4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,This brush to clean the dr brown bottles worked really good!  We actually need to buy another one though.  We used it too much and the sponge actually gave out.  But that\'s just like any dish washing sponge.  Other than that we love this brush.  We bought another type of bottle scrubber and it did not last long!,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,These are great for our Dr. Brown\'s glass bottles but the sponge wears out after a few weeks. I find myself replacing this brush often but it is a perfect piece of equipment for cleaning bottles; would rate higher if the sponge did not wear out so quickly.,3
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,I bought this to clean my baby\'s feeding bottle. It really does what it is described. It cleans all the sides of the bottle. Great I item to have. Highly recommended.,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"I received this brush for a shower gift and unfortunately, the foam on top broke off within a week!  I returned to Amazon (thank you for the wonderful customer service, Amazon!), and bought a competitor\'s brush which I\'ve now used every day (to wash around 16 bottles a day - we have twins!!!) for the past 7 months.  Don\'t buy this brush and go for the competitor\'s.  I do love Dr. Brown\'s bottles, but the brush isn\'t well made.",1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,Was broken after only 4 weeks of use. The metal part is too thin and brakes. Do not buy this brush.,1
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,Hi this is a must have item for the Dr brown\'s bottle kit including the steam sterilizer.Gret value and great performance,5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"It\'s just a run of the mill bottle brush but it is Dr. Brown\'s and me and my wife have everything Dr. Brown. I like the little suction cup stand that is used for holding the brush up right, very clean very sanitary. Would recommend it to others.",4
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"It looks amazing, and useful, it fit the plastic bottle well but a little small to the glass bottle, anyway it use well.",5
Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Brush,"i received a blue color one different color from the image but nothing to complain about. i just received this today and it is faster than estimated delivery :D i just used this to wash breast milk storage bottles and it clean it well without soap, i can see clearly through the bottle unlike the sponge that are uses for dishes they still leave milk inside the bottle. im in love with this bottle brush it makes my life easier",5
Baby Einstein Links,"my 2 months old son likes to stare at the colors and now tries to grab it from me, very nice for the price.",5
Baby Einstein Links,"The large, round caterpillar ring in this Baby Einstein link set has been my baby\'s favorite toy since she first started grasping objects...  She smiles when she sees it, stares at the colors on his back, traces its bumps with her finger, holds it up in the air to see how it looks in the light, turns it around, bangs it against the table, crawls with it still in her hand, bites it when she\'s teething, and holds it up for me to ""bite"" and then giggles.  This toy keeps her calm in the car and while we\'re out shopping.  I can\'t say enough good things about it...  (I even had to get a 2nd one in case we lost it.)The other links that come with this set are cute, but seem to get ""loose"" with heavy use.  (Some toys with small links can fall off them.)  However, I would buy this set again in a heartbeat, just to see my baby\'s face light up at that little caterpillar she loves so much.",5
Baby Einstein Links,I think this will be an excellent baby rattle when my new niece is old enough to play with it.  I purchased it to include in a gift basket for her baby shower.,4
Baby Einstein Links,The baby loved the colors and the fact that he could move the pieces around and chew on them too.,5
Baby Einstein Links,"I purchased these for my 5 month old nephew.  When they came, I was kind of disappointed as they looked like they were geared for a much younger child.  However, my nephew loves them! They are ""grabbable"", ""gummable"" and ""colorful.""  He\'ll be amused by them for several months.",5
Baby Einstein Links,"My daughter loves these. I keep a set in her diaper bag for just ""in case"" she needs a toy and another set at home.",5
Baby Einstein Links,"My granddaughter likes a lot of things and she really likes putting things together.  However, these links didn\'t do much for her.  They fell apart too easily, and she was pretty much done after a few minutes (or seconds).  However, they were great in the pool for playing and retrieving.  But there are a lot of other things that are even better in pools.  So, this item is a &#34;save your money, buy something else&#34; for me.",3
Baby Einstein Links,"My 7 month old loves these, especially banging them against his crib rails.  He\'s been using them since he was about 4 months old and I they are nice and easy to grip.  Great to chew on too!  They are also useful for hanging things from carriers/strollers, etc.",5
Baby Einstein Links,YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH LINKS.....YOU LOOSE THEM AND NEED TO REPLACE THEM SOMETIMES.....BUT A GREAT PRODUCT FOR ATTACHING TOYS TO STROLLERS AND OTHER GEAR.,5

Dr. Brown\'s Electric Breast Pump,I recently had a baby in the NICU seven days past my discharge and had to pump at the hospital and home.  This product just plain didn\'t work well and it was extremely loud and annoying.  This pump left me engorged because it couldn\'t express my milk.  I ended up renting a pump from the lactation department at the hospital and plan to purchase a Medela pump when the rental is over.,1
Dr. Brown\'s Electric Breast Pump,I own this pump as well as the Dr. Brown\'s manual pump-both are excellent products and at a very good price.,5
Dr. Brown\'s Electric Breast Pump,"If you\'re looking for gentle more than productive, this is your pump!Easy to clean and easy to use.I would recommend it if you pump occasionnaly and have time to do it.If you need it done fast and often, I would recommend a different pump",3
Dr. Brown\'s Electric Breast Pump,"I love the Dr. Brown bottles and the Dr. Brown freezer storage bags, so I thought this was a great pump before I got it. First of all it pinches the nipples and really hurts. Second It only lasted 1 week before it broke. I don\'t recommend it at all, and I hope the makers improve it.",2

Gund My 1st Teddy- Blue,"We got this as our 1st birthday gift for our son. Great blue teddy. Very fluffy and fun to play with, roll over and sit on it.

Woodstock Plastic Kazoo,"I love this kazoo. It is a lot nicer than some of the dollar-store or goody-bag ones.

Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Green,"I decided to spend a little more than I wanted on this booster for my 3-year-old son. It fits perfectly on my dining room chairs and it doesn\'t slip unless you really are trying to move it. My son likes to use it, which is a wonder if you knew my son. I actually wish I would remember to bring this booster with me to restaurants because it\'s a lot wider than those little booster seats they have in those restaurants so it looks like it\'s more comfortable for him and a little safer because it won\'t tip over as easily as the ones they usually have in restaurants.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Green,"Very nice and comfortable seat for my 2 year old but I am now purchasing my third one because, over time, it tends to tear.  She eventually tore the side of it off after it cracked.  However, I am purchasing this again because it is by far the most comfortable for my children.  My 5 year old also uses this and she loves it.",3

Peg Perego Uno Convertible Carriage to Stroller System in Pure Vapor,"Love the way it transforms from pushchair / stroller to pram / carriage mode so baby is facing you - but it feels a bit cheap.  Ironic when it\'s an expensive piece of kit.Like that Primo Viaggio infant carrier fits perfectly on it (strap for other models) - like the foot muff / boot too......Baby LOVES the harness as he gets to move loads...... also keeps his back coolerNot sure about the 1) plastic feel to it (flimsy?)  or 2) the wheels and steering in carriage mode - but Baby very happy and comfy in it.LOOKS COOL! and will be a favourite for going to the Mall as it handles OK and does pretty much everything I want (we also have an Aria for travelling as it\'s light and a Jeep Overland for off road terrain such as woods or have you seen the applaing state of the roads in New Jersey!!!) but I still think if you have the cash (which I don\'t since I stopped working) - buy the Stokke xplory as it\'s high up and I know babies love to see what\'s going on.  However, it\'s an OK stroller and I take comfort from the fact that it\'s Peg Perego so if anyting goes wrong they SHOULD fix it.",4
Peg Perego Uno Convertible Carriage to Stroller System in Revi Black,"I did a lot of research before purchasing a stroller and finally decided on the Uno for a number of reasons. First, I wanted a slightly higher end stroller without having to spend 750+ dollars. Secondly, I wanted a product that wasn\'t too heavy, offered the child lot a lot of room, a bassinet, a tray and a large storage basket. Lastly, I wanted a stroller that had bigger wheels as I found they handled better.Unfortunately, my experience with the Uno has been somwhat mediocre. First, it didn\'t assemble easily (which I think has to do with the fact that it is constructed primarily of plastic). As a result, the wheels came off (while I was using it) at least a half a dozen times in a month and the brake also had problems (quite simply, the mechanism is poor and just does not always work properly). This was incredibly frustrating and somewhat embaressing to say the least. The last time my husband addressed the wheel problem, he used a lot of force to jam them into their sockets and luckily, they have not fallen off since.I have the Peg Perego car seat and I love it. However, fitting it into the Uno is confusing and oftentimes difficult. Although it is supposed to ""clip right in"", unless the stroller\'s backrest, handle and front bar are all in the right positions, the car seat will not fit properly and this often leaves the car seat wobbling back and forth. In a nutshell, the design is confusing, not at all intuitive and the instruction manual this product comes with is of no help whatsoever.All in all, I gave this stroller a 3 star rating because it looks good, is very comfortable for baby and overall, met all the criteria I was looking for when I purchased it. However, I would have expected the product to be better constructed and easier to use. Right now it is awkward/clumsy and not at all intuitive.While no where near as expensive than the\'luxurious\' brands out there, it also doesn\'t measure up in terms of quality (in this case, you truly get what you pay for), so if having a fantastic stroller is important to you, I would spend the extra money and buy something better. In retrospect I wish I had.",3
Babydan Pram Seat,Thepram seat is exactly what I was looking for. I had one when my children were little and now my daughter is expecting her second. The seatwill be perfect for the toddler nd it is the one  ( serendipitously ) madefor the pram we got at a yard sale.,5

Edushape My Soft World Block Set- Farm,"Purchased for my 12mo son - glad I got these instead of real wooden blocks at the time.  He loved playing with these, but would also throw them everywhere (including at other kids), so it worked out as these are sort of foam/soft blocks.  Only downside is that colorful pictures eventually start peeling off some of the pieces (the cars, people, etc), especially when my son started chewing on them at about 15mos.  Overall was a good purchase though; I don\'t regret buying these.",4
Edushape My Soft World Block Set- Farm,"These blocks are great.  There are four little people, several cars and trucks, trees and building materials for a little foam city.  He loves to stack them and have me knock them over.  He chews on them with two sharp little teeth, but no pieces ever come off in his mouth.  They have also withstood 2 months of constant dishwashing, and still look brand new.  I especially like these because unlike other blocks, he can\'t hurt his tender gums with these because they are so soft.  The bright colors get his attention, and he always army crawls over to the plastic container when he spies it sitting by his toy box.  These were a great buy (and I\'ve bought plenty of junk since he\'s been born).  I\'ll probably buy these again if he ever wears them out.",5
Edushape My Soft World Block Set- Farm,I found these blocks at my daughters daycare and ordered a set for myself. I really like the look (looks like real blocks) and my daughter now knows the animals and the sounds that they make.  She loves to stack and knock over.  All the kids in daycare loved it as well.,5
Edushape My Soft World Block Set- Farm,"These are great blocks, but the container they come in is kinda flimsy.  The latches on the box broke off and I considered that a choking hazard.  Other than that my child plays with these often.",3
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I was worried about getting this carrier- I have a large chest and am plus sized.  I was worried that it would be uncomfortable or not fit.  I love my Moby!I bought my Moby in Navy Blue and it was great for carrying my young son.Positives:- my son had colic and this was excellent for him- felt secure when tied CORRECTLY- more attractive than other carriers in my opinion- many sites (even youtube) that teach you how to tie it correctly- put it on at home under my coat, and then just slipped child into it- no messing around putting it onNegatives:-whew it got hot in that Moby, it is not for the summer (or pick one of their more breathable models- I stopped using it around 6 months.  I know others use it longer, but my baby was far too wiggly and bouncy (it was like having a washing machine attached to your chest haha!)I highly recommend a Moby- but I also highly recommend learning how to use ANY baby carrier correctly.  Your baby should be in a hug hold, not a horizontal hold.  You should be able to kiss the top of your baby\'s head when they are in the carrier.  You should never cover the child\'s face in the carrier.  Remember to wear your baby safely!",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",This is my 5th baby carrier out of 3 children. I love how versatile the Moby wrap is.  You do have to get it on before going out because it is not practical to slip on in the grocery store parking lot (it\'s too long).  It was easy for me to get the hang of and my baby loves being in it.  I will say I wish I had bought it sooner because my baby is going on 18lbs and is getting a little heavy to tote around all day long.  It distributes the weight very well but I guess it can\'t make her any lighter.,4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I bought my first Moby Wrap when my second son hit 3 weeks and I suspected he had colic. He only seemed happy when I held him, much like many other infants. I\'ve used a Snugli, Ultimate Baby Wrap (too stretchy to feel secure), and an Infantino sling, but I had seen a baby in a Moby once before, and it had looked so comfortable for mom and baby that I knew I wanted to try it out. The bottom line is that I am a really big fan of the Moby Wrap, and I\'m writing this review for parents considering purchasing one.For those concerned about difficulty of putting the wrap on correctly, I will say that some folks, depending on their learning style, may have some trouble. Simple solution: go to youtube and check out the many demonstration videos for all the different holds.For those concerned about the length of the wrap, you could always put the wrap on at home, then hop in the car and head to your destination. I often do this when I\'m short on time or when the weather\'s bad. If you tie yours in the back and would prefer not to drive around with a knot of fabric poking you in the back, just leave the last knot untied until you arrive at your destination. Additionally, the only parts that MIGHT touch the ground during the tying process are the ends, which do not touch your baby, so no worries!So what happens if you don\'t love your Moby? Gently used Moby Wraps sell on ebay and craigslist for $20 - $30! Resale value is pretty impressive compared to most baby gear, so don\'t balk at the $40 price tag. It\'s definitely worth every penny. I carry my son around just about everywhere (church, shopping, park, zoo, etc...) and I know you\'ll enjoy yours, too.",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I am a mother of five and with each child I try a new carrier because I usually have major complaints with each one.  I guess my kids aren\'t slinging kids!  Anyway, I have liked the Moby Wrap for the most part.  My baby really likes it better than any of my other kids liked slinging and he snuggles in quite nicely.  He also enjoys facing out and seeing all the world around him.  Another good thing is that by wrapping it on me only one way, I can carry my baby multiple ways without re-wrapping.  Also, if he dozes off, it is no big thing to adjust a piece of fabric to hold his head or get him comfy. My complaints with this one are: 1) it is hot.  I guess most slings are hot, and this one probably isn\'t any hotter than a padded sling, but it is definitely warm.  2) You look like a mummy unwrapping when you take it off.  Ha!  I guess I am a mummy unwrapping :)  Anyway, it looks and feels slightly ridiculous to unwrap a mile\'s worth of fabric from your body every time you need to take it off.  I wish there were a way to slip it off intact and then slip it back on without the whole unwrapping ceremony.  You don\'t have to take it off to nurse however, but I haven\'t gotten that nursing while wearing thing to work (you need nursing tops for that...I despise nursing tops). A couple more things to note:  I bought the orange and it is not exactly the same color as the picture on Amazon...more earthy colored orange.  It has been washed and dried repeatedly with no major fading.  After drying it is slightly more snug but after one wearing it stretches out comfortably.  After several wearings baby might sling a little low, but just wash and dry and voila! it\'s snug again. All in all I\'m more pleased with the Moby than a pouch sling, Maya wrap, Baby Bjorn, or another ring sling that I made myself (my second favorite).  Hope this helps someone!",4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",This wrap is too complicate. It\'s not easy to wear. My husband has no time for it. I returned it and bought some thing else that we both can wear.,1
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",Love it for my newborn. Too much fabric to wrap quickly. Color is versatile. Fabric is soft and washes well.,4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","My 5 month old boy LOVES this wrap. He hated slings so I thought wearing him wasn\'t going to happen until I found this wrap. He absolutely loves his Moby and I am very comfortable wearing it. People always stop me to comment on how cute we look in it, too!",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",I love the Moby Wrap!!!  It is great for keeping my son near and frees up my hands so that I can multi-task.  :-),5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","We tried another sling for our first baby, and when we discovered the Mobi we found out how inferior all other slings are.The Mobi isn\'t a sling; it\'s a wrap. The way the wrap works (which is described in the instructions that come with the Mobi means that the baby is held securely, close to mom in a way that makes it impossible for them to fall out, while supporting them in a way that is safe. Our Mobi wrap was recommended by our pediatrician, and she was right!We\'ve shared this with other new parents, and every one of them has loved it as well. After using ours, I know at least three other families who later bought a Mobi.You won\'t be disappointed!",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","Babywearing a wonderful sanity saver for both moms a babies. My 6month old daught was a classic colic/high-needs baby, and I wouldn\'t be the calm, effective, with-it mommy I am today without babywearing!I originally used a ring sling, but around 15lbs my baby go too heavy for me to comfortably wear for long periods of time. So, I tried out the Moby wrap. It\'s fantastic! The weight is so much more evenly distributed, and it doesn\'t hurt my back or sholders. I can wear her for hours and it\'s no big deal. Our baby loves being worn, and seems to also prefer the Moby to the sling. My husband actually ties her onto his back!There are TONS of different wraps, far more than what is shown in the booklet or on the Moby website. Check out youtube for all the different holds.I will make the comment that I have NO idea how moms breastfeed using this. Breastfeeding in a sling was really easy, but I can\'t figure it out in the Moby. Also, I think the ring sling was ""easier"" to use in the sense that you just put it on and go, so going to the grocery store was faster and easier. But, you can put your Moby on before leaving to do errands, drive, and then slide your little one (or big one!) in the Moby when you get to your destination.",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",The Moby Wrap is a comfortable baby carrier that\'s easy to use once you\'ve got the technique down.  I highly recommend it!,5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","When researching different wraps 2 stood out Moby andOriginal Sleepy Wrap Baby Carrier (Orange).  I ended up purchasing the moby and I recieved a sleepy wrap as a gift. They arfe both wrap style carriers but the big difference is that I think the sleepy wrap is a bit cooler and I live in south Texas, so any little bit helps, another thing is that with the moby I felt as though I had to constantly re-adjust my baby. The Moby is a pretty good product I just perfer the sleepy wrap. I will say that it is a bit confusiong to wrap at 1st but once you get the hang of it, its very quick. My son is now 5 months and 16lbs, even though it says you can wrap larger babies I dont feel comfortable doing it but 4 months and under it is a must.",4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I wanted some way to wear my baby that would be comfortable for both of us.  A few friends recommended moby and moby style wraps, so I got this with high hopes.  My son and I both found it cumbersome, hot, and constricting.  Maybe we weren\'t doing something right, but he hated.*There are SO many layers of material, once you finally manage to get the damned thing on properly, that the both of you will be sweating like proverbial professional women in a church before long.*Actually getting the thing ON is way too much like work, and if you want to nurse in it, it takes even more finagling and adjustment. I never managed to successfully nursed in my moby wrap.  It could be that I am too well endowed to nurse in a wrap, but the way the wrap squashed my son against me made it impossible for him to nurse without having his entire face mashed into my breast.  Suffocation is not exactly a positive side effect of breastfeeding.*On the subject of squashing, I never managed to find a happy medium for this thing.  Either we both felt constricted, or it was too loose for me to feel confident wearing it.  My son wasn\'t, I guess, normal in the constriction department.  Rather than being soothed by swaddling and confining wraps, he would throw an absolute conniption.I think some of our issues may have been worked out with practice, but the thing is so time consuming to put on and arrange, and I was so sweaty and tired after wrestling with the wrap and the baby, plus the wrap at the waist pressed directly into my c-section which was unpleasant for quite some time after I was (per the doctor) healed enough for normal activity, that I just didn\'t have the patience to keep trying at it.  My baby threw a fit every time he was in it, and that stressed me out completely.  I just didn\'t have the stamina for this  method.He did like a sling carrier when he waster having repeated spills with the snack trap (due to my son ripping off the lid), I decided to try a snack container which screwed together.  So far, this has been a winner in our book.  The lid stays on and most of the snack stays in, due to the smaller sized opening (which is perfect for small hands).EDIT: These snack containers only lasted two months for us.  Lids will no longer stay on or closed.  Not worth the money.",5
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,As cute as this snack ball is (we have purple/green) it is a real pain to use.  It truly is a ball in that it rolls and rolls and rolls all around your house/car whenever the small kids drop it.  Kind of funny the first 30 times but after that it gets a bit old.  If only they had made it with a flat bottom!  I don\'t recommend this but instead would point you to the snacktrap B0009FIMPG.,2
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,"I already had one snack ball made by a different company that I really loved, that is why I ordered this additional one.  It is similar but not identical to the one I already have.  This one is sturdy and closes well, but it doesn\'t have a flat bottom, so if you sit it on the table, it WILL roll off.  The other one has a flat bottom so it doesn\'t roll.  This is a major design flaw for a container for small snacks.  I liked the color of the ball, and I love the concept, but no flat bottom equals poor planning on the designers part.",2
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,Love Boon products but this one missed the mark. My toddler was never able to use it for snacks. Opening is too small and slightly rough. We use it as a bath toy instead.,2
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,"This is perfect for toddlers who are careful enough to hold it without spilling but also interested in the novel design (about 2 yrs. old+)! My almost 3 yr. old has not tired of the fun design after using it for a year and loves to snack from it on walks and in the car.  I thinks it\'s the perfect size; not too small as others have commented -- it is a SNACK ball after all! It fits great in my diaper bag -- you can always grab it in an over-stuffed bag, and it never lets crumbs out! My 1 yr. old loves it, too, although I of course can\'t give it to her unattended (but even snack traps are no match for a determined baby!). I have 4 and am buying 2 more since I\'m constantly using them. The added bonus of this container is that you have a spur-of-the-moment toy for when you\'re waiting with the kids somewhere and need a diversion... DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.",5
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas. He loves the bright colours and I love that his snacks don\'t get crushed in a bag anymore. I can see where people say their little ones can\'t get their hands in it, but I just shake the snacks out so it\'s not a big deal. I was a little wary of the lid because a lot of people said it was flimsy, but I disagree. Plus this makes a great toy to roll on the floor. We\'re very pleased!",4
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,"My son has been at around 20 percentile weight wise and the height 50+ percentile (60~75).  He\'s smaller but after 15 months, the hole was too small for him.  He\'s now 22 months old.  If you are interested in this, purchase it before your child turns 1 so that you get more use of it.It\'s harder for kids to open and makes little mess as there\'s no open spaces when the lid is closed.Nice color and design.",4
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,It\'s in good quality and very cute. I would like to recommend to my friends. I have the word requirement.,4
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,My friend says she really loves this.  It doesn\'t spill in the diaper bag.  She likes how portable it is.,5
Boon Snack Ball - Snack Container in Orange/Blue,"I\'ve had this for 2 years but finally felt the need to write a review to save others the annoyance of buying this.  I suppose when you get desperate, it does the job but there are far better snack options out there - like the snack trap. My problem with this is that it\'s hard so when dropped, it can crack. The round shape makes it awkward to fit in my purse. It doesn\'t hold much either compared to other snack options. But the worst part, the orange opening is kind of difficult for my toddler to open. So any time I use it with him, he is constantly whining and fussing as he uses it because he can\'t get the orange tab to open. However, he can easily unscrew the two halves so I end up with cheerios everywhere. I have decided to throw it out when he\'s not looking today. The snack trap or even those formula dispenser containers have been much better snack options.",2

It\'s not microwavable b/c it\'s melamine but most of his plates actually are the same so it\'s not a huge deal. i would prefer it were made out of something microwavable though so i can\'t give it 5 stars.But we love it. I would highly recommend it. I\'m thinking of tossing all our other plates and getting just these.",4
"Boon Groovy Interlocking Plate and Bowl Set, Orange/White","The idea of this plate is fantastic.  I was most looking forward to the little bowls that clip on the plate.  When I got it the first thing I noticed is they just sit, or hang, on the side of the plate.  Easily removed and thrown by a curious toddler.  All I could imagine was dipping sauces on the wall!  The plate is also very small, it appears larger than it actually is an the bowl isn\'t very deep.Overall this is a quality product, BPA free, strong enough to endure a rough plate throwing toddler but in my opinion its just too small and the smaller cups should secure on there.",3
"Boon Groovy Interlocking Plate and Bowl Set, Orange/White","This is a great dish that is made very solidly despite being plastic. The bottom is weighed, it has a non-slip base, and it is BPA free.

He can eat and so can we.  Great buy.",4
"Boon Benders Adaptable Utensils, Blue/White","The bendable features seems great, but the spoon area that\'s suppose to hold food needs better design.

FunBath Angel Dear BLUE BEAR Blankie,"I got one of these as a baby shower gift before my son was born by a friend whose sons have the duck and the frog. Now, at 7 months old Mr. Bear is an integral part of our bedtime routine. He lives ONLY in the crib (although there\'s one in our babysitter\'s travel crib for naptimes) and my son loves to snuggle up with him at bedtime. I feel safe having it in the crib with him because the blanket part is small enough that he could never get it wrapped around his head (although he does often sleep with it over his face) to suffocate him. I\'ve bought three more bears so I can wash them without my son missing him. And my friend\'s sons now want my son to bring Mr. Bear so that they can have a ""blankie party.""",5

When I received it in the mail, I was not disappointed. The flowers are more ""peach"" than ""yellow"", but that was fine by me. The entire cake comes wrapped in tulle, which I left on for the display.I bought one cake for a baby girl shower and a second one for an ""unknown gender"" shower. I\'ve recently found out that couple is having a boy and I think the color will do just fine.The silk orchids are really pretty, and the first mom has already placed them as decorations in her baby room. The baby block is also a neat decoration for the baby room.The small cake does feel a little small when you first pull it out of the box. However, when you actually display it on a table and when it is surrounded by food or other decorations it fits in nicely.Overall, I was very pleased with my purchase, and everything arrived on time and well packaged.",5
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"This was a recommendation from my sister. The price was right and Baby Jogger is known for their compact folds.  If money wasn\'t an issue, I probably would have opted for the BOB.  My sister has that in a single and the double is a 3 wheel instead of 4 wheel design.The wheels are great for urban areas, with cracked sidewalks, curbs, potholes, etc.  The harness, the sun shades, recline, etc. are all awesome.  You can steer this with one hand.I cannot give this a 5 star rating for the following: you are nickeled and dimed, more like \'twentied, fiftied and hundred,\' for the acessories. So the total \'investment\' can add up very quickly quickly.This is a great stroller if you don\'t travel a lot.  Why? It hogs a lot of track space. Interestingly, our small SUV has less room for it versus a regualr sedan! My wife and I live in a downtown are and we walk a lot. The size of the stroller is misleading because it will fit through standard door openings.  We\'ve taken it into office buildings, malls, retail stores, library, etc. - it fits so well.",4
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"May this review serve as a humble contribution to the astounding community of parent (and grandparent!) reviewers on Amazon. Thank you all!We are a tall family who needed a high weight-limit, heavy-duty stroller for our twins. We\'ve had this stroller for about a year now. It\'s an investment, so a detailed review is in order. Let\'s go for a walk...Pros: Easy Rider.- This is one smoooooooooth ride folks. Cobblestones, rough pavement, grass, dirt, snow, twigs; doesn\'t matter. It easily glides over any terrain. It\'ll put the kids to sleep and make your nanny weep.- It turns on a dime. (A lot of ""jogging"" strollers don\'t.)- The kids are comfortable, most of the time (see below).- It\'s comfortable for long walks, and even with the backs down it doesn\'t nip the shins. It also has plenty of seat and belt room for blankets, snugglers, wraps, layers, lovies and the like.- I\'m 6\' and my husband is 6\'4"". The (adjustable) handle and the stroller seem built for tall people, and the seats seem built for tall babies and kids. Lots of room for them and no back pain for us. They have a lot of room to grow into it, not out of it.- The shoulder harnesses are adjustable to a tall height. They are also removable so there can be just a lap belt for the little ones who don\'t need shoulder harnesses yet.- You can hang many pounds from the back of it and it won\'t tip over, even when it\'s empty. A good tip for grocery shopping, that 20-pound double diaper bag, and root vegetable season at the farmer\'s market.Cons: Driving The Bus.For something called the ""City Classic"" this stroller isn\'t very city-friendly.- A parent console would have been nice. Can Mama get a cupholder at least? Paying an additional $50 for one is insulting, especially when it was included with our ""cheapie"" umbrella strollers.- The seats are deep buckets and it has canvas sides, so the kids have to lean forward to look around. The natural position of the seat is rather reclined. This seems trivial, but the kids lean forward for an hour+ at a time on a long walk. Also, their legs are higher than their seats. They are both over 30"" tall and size 2T, yet it seems like they\'re sitting in a well. (Hello, in there?)- It read well online, but the ""quick fold"" isn\'t ergonomic or convenient. It\'s a straight horizontal fold instead of the accordion fold of most strollers. Even folded it takes up a lot of room and you\'ll need both hands to carry it. The fold also means the handlebar is against the ground when it\'s stored, so it gets dirty and scraped up pretty fast.- It\'s a behemoth. It\'s so big you can pretend it\'s a camel and you\'re in a Silk Road caravan. It\'s so big that strangers comment on it, and I dare say some cross the street when they see it coming. The width is one of Baby Jogger\'s big selling points, which is why it\'s worth discussing.To wit:- It claims to fit through all ""standard doors"" but it won\'t fit through doorways in old buildings, small stores, or any building that isn\'t updated to ADA standards. In a city like NYC, that eliminates a LOT of options. For example, it doesn\'t fit through the front door or down the narrow hallway of our old building. Consider the implications of that, logistically, with babies who aren\'t walking yet. In hindsight that alone would have kept me from buying this model. If you\'re unsure, measure your daily spaces!- It weighs a ton. 35 pounds doesn\'t seem like a lot when you see it on sale with free shipping. Trust me, 35 pounds is very heavy.- It takes up the lion\'s share of the back of our otherwise roomy Jeep Cherokee.- Unless Atlas himself is with you, forget hefting it through an airport.- You can also forget the subway. Just...forget it.- Unless you\'re very strong, balanced, and very patient, forget navigating a flight of stairs. When I tried, it took three adults to help me and I got a lesson in humility.- It will hog a typical elevator, which has forced us to wait for the next one or leave other people to wait. ""Sorry, this elevator is full - with my stroller.""To sum: this is a great stroller - if you live for the park or nature reserve, have wide open stores and public spaces, and if you own a car with a low, large trunk that doesn\'t need to carry much else. They should have named it the Suburban classic - it\'s the size of a Suburban, and fits well in that environment.But if, like us, you live with stairs, subways, old buildings, and narrow everything (halls, sidewalks, doors, etc), I would keep looking.One more note, for you twin parents: we bought two umbrella strollers and connectors. It seemed counterintuitive at first but WOW does it make things easier when we\'re both out. For restaurants, crowds, subways, and for travel (especially in airports) it\'s a system that can\'t be beat. We got the whole rig for $100, and it\'s been 100% worth it.Cheers!",3
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"My wife convinced my that we ""needed"" this stroller. It turned out to be too large for the truck and just as heavy as any other stroller--we couldn\'t fit groceries, and in the end the I regretted being convinced to pay the money.",1
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"I am seriously frugal by nature but very willing to spend money on quality items that are NEEDED.  In my case a double is necessary.  I have a 5 month old son and a 10 month old daughter and each fit great and seem quite comfy.The ease of folding this stroller amazes people.  Took me a few days though to get the front wheels consistently in the right direction so it would fold in its flattest position to fit in my trunk.  I have a Ford Taurus and it fits great, not tons of room for other things and I have to put the stroller away then pack things around it but that isn\'t terrible.I love that each side reclines independently and that I can do diaper changes now without having to locate a bathroom.  I can even keep a couple diapers (cloth) for each tucked into the netting on the backside while it is folded in my trunk.  Makes is easier to load and go.This stroller handles so well I even manage grocery shopping with both babies and a cart with no problems.  It can be controlled easily one handed when necessary.",5
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"I haven\'t used my City Classic too many times since the winter weather is setting in, but so far, I love it!!  I can steer with one hand and no wrist pain whatsoever.  My new baby isn\'t here yet, but I take my 20 month old and my lazy pug out in it.  My son can sit up and has his own sun shade while the dog\'s side is fully reclined with the shade up.  The shades are great too because it will go almost to the edge of the seat if you detach it at the top.  The handlebar is hugely adjustable and comfortable for me (5ft) and my husband (6\'1"").  My diaper bag easily fits in the basket (which is removable)and there are some pockets on the seat backs, but I bought the Baby Jogger parent tray which is much more practical and offers a ton more space.  The ride is very smooth and I will easily be able to do slow jogs with this stroller.  The best part is that it folds up really easily and it fits in the back of my Nissan Versa without having to put the seats down or take the wheels off.  Nothing else will fit back there with it, but that\'s ok.  My one complaint is that it doesn\'t have any kind of strap to lock it into place when it is folded up.  Our Baby Jogger bike trailer does, and I am not sure why they didn\'t include this feature on the stroller.",5
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"If you are looking for a slim double stroller this is a great one to get.  A little heavy yes, but the easy quick fold makes up for that for sure.  In an instant I can have it folded up and put in the back of my car.  It manuvers well and the ride is so smooth.  I was looking at a Valco and Bumbleride as well (all less than 30 inches wide), but for the price this one was the best option.  I especilly LOVE how the shades come down so low, the seats recline just about all the way down for naps, and that it has extra storage on the back of the seats.  Overall, it is the perfect double stroller for me and my needs.  It is great for walks anywhere and I love taking it on outings and trips.  Just wish is came with a cup holder for me and for the kids.  That would make it PERECT!**My oldest is almost three and tall and has PLENTY of room**From what I understand Baby Jogger isn\'t making the city classic anymore though...glad I got mine in time!",5
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,This is by far the best strollers I have used.The the almost full recline seat feature is such a good one.Little babies enjoy the most. Great stroller for urbane living,5
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"Our stroller just arrived today and it is great! It is so wonderfully made. It came fully assembled in the box I just had to put the wheels on, which was very easy. The instruction manual is clear and easy to follow. The stroller turns on a dime and is so light. It is not very wide at all, compared to other side by side double strollers. The sun shades really provide a lot of coverage. We got the chocolate and stone color and it is really pretty. The basket and behind seat storage seem like they will hold a fair amount of stuff. Overall, a great stroller.",5
Baby Jogger City Classic Double Stroller - Navy/Silver,"I don\'t own this stroller, but I\'ve been searching for one that will hold a toddler and an infant while I run...yes, I really want to run with it.

"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemats, 20-Count",now i don have a worry when i bring my 8 month old son out to eat. it gives him a clean surface to eat on.,4
"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemats, 20-Count","These disposable placemats are great for dining out.

"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemats, 20-Count","I really enjoy using these Table Toppers with my son when we eat out.

Overall, though, I recommend them for anyone who eats out with their kids.",4
"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemats, 20-Count","These are great for dining out.  They have two strips of tape that keep it down and fun, colorful designs.  Restaurants don\'t always have tables clean enough to eat off of and my daughter hasn\'t figured out plates or bowls yet.  These allow her to eat with the rest of us.  I also like the idea that they are bio-degradable.",5
"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemats, 20-Count","Tired of the ""plate throwing"" stage?  These mats are an ideal solution for eating out with a baby or young toddler.  When it comes to stuffing the diaper bag, I\'m a minimalist.  But, these were essentials for us. Every time we used them, we had at least three people stop to ask us where we got them.  I now add these to all baby shower gifts!",5
Baby Jogger City Elite Single Stroller - Tan/Black,"I did a lot of research before deciding which stroller to buy. At one point we were between the Mountain Buggy, BOB, Bugaboo and City Elite. In spite of the fact that all of the other ones seem to be much more popular and that I was able to find lots of reviews on the first 3 and very few on the City Elite, we ended up opting for the latter one. I have to say that we are more than pleased with our choice. We did borrow a Bugaboo for a while and the City elite is much easier to steer and push. The truth is you barely have to push it at all because it drives so easily, you can do it with one hand and hold your hubby\'s hand or toddler\'s hand with the other one. This stroller has A LOT of storage space and there\'s even places for you to put your water bottle, wallet, cell phone, keys, ipod etc, easy to reach and included in the price (with other strollers you have to buy cup holders separately). The sun canopy is absolutely unmatched by other strollers and way better than the MB. We can walk facing the sun directly and my baby still doesn\'t get sun on her face. It reclines further back (almost flat) than the BOB, and it has an opening flap foot rest for when baby is asleep. Also, the under seat basket can be reached from the front of the stroller as well by lifting the foot rest flap. The stroller is very easy to close and my baby seems very comfortable in it. The seat is very easy to recline (much easier to do and better made than MB which you have to adjust on both sides when reclining, which makes it hard to get the seat to be equally angled on both sides) and very easy to pull back up. The sun canopy has windows for you to be able to look at your baby as you stroll, and it also has side windows that you can open for ventilation. The windows open and close with magnets so baby doesn\'t wake up as she would if they opened and closed with velcro. The City Elite is sturdy and well constructed and will last you a long time. I don\'t think it has anything to envy the BOB (unless you want to jog with it because the City Elite is not for jogging) or the MB which is much more expensive and has inferior features.That said, there\'s a few things that I find to be cons with this stroller, but most of them are more of a personal issue than a problem with the stroller itself:1)We cannot bring our diaper bag with us because we have a very big one and it won\'t fit in the under seat basket so we have to spread the contents of the diaper bag into the different compartments the stroller provides.2)Child can only face forward so I miss out on looking at her beautiful face while we stroll and I still wonder whether I would have traded ease of drive for rear facing child as in the Uppa Baby Stroller, but this is just a matter of personal choice.3)It is heavy to carry when folded so we use it primarily around the neighborhood, I don\'t think that I\'d like to put it in and out of the car every day for errands.4)It is super easy to close, but not as easy to open. It is also not incredibly complicated to open either, just not as easy as it is to close.Nevertheless, these are very few cons compared to all the pros the stroller has to offer and as I said we are more than pleased with our choice. All in all this is a fantastic stroller well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
Bebe Sounds &quot;It\'s a Girl!&quot; Stork Inflatable,This thing is huge. It definitely shows off you have a little one. Fills up quickly and stays inflated. The lighting is adequate at night.,5

Bebe Sounds &quot;It\'s a Girl!&quot; Stork Inflatable,Looks great. Product came as advertised. Easy to assemble and works great. Glad I bought it and have told  quite a few people where I got it.,5
Bebe Sounds &quot;It\'s a Girl!&quot; Stork Inflatable,"I purchased this item prior to going into the hospital for the birth of my daughter and set it up for the new grandparents to inflate after the birth.  Out of the box it is wrapped up in a way that gives the impression it is used.  My assumption is that someone tested the item prior to shipping it and did not fold it in a way that is consistent with a new product.  Regardless, the inflatable includes four metal stakes and two plastic stakes.  There was a patch included in the box along with an extra light in case the lights malfunctioned.You put the four metal stays in using the loop holes at the middle of each side.  On the ends you have a tie off point amount midway up the side of the inflatable.  You tie a black string to the points and around the plastic stakes.  After done you zip up the back to hold in the air, connect the power cable, and the inflatable blows up.  The instructions state that it takes around three minutes to blow up and that appears correct.  My recommendation is to adjust the side tie downs as it blows up to find the right tension.  It lights up at night and if you angle the point of the stakes towards the inflatable with the head away it holds up through wind.  We had severe thunderstorms with wind and only one stake was removed.The inflatable is large and easily read.  We received many compliments on it and put it in storage as a gift to anyone else having a little girl.  One thing to note is that the printing is only on one side, so you point it to the street instead of turning it to face traffic traveling in either direction of travel.  This isn\'t an issue for me, but may be difficult for some on a curve where most will not look in a direction 90 or 270 degrees to their travel direction.Great product.",5

Fisher Price Peek a Block Incrediblock,"This toy wasn\'t my first pick, but thanks to Grandma...  lol.  My first daughter pulled herself up on it and was ready to walk by 9 months.  Its the block play and music on the top that did it.  This toy made it through 2 more kids, and now my oldest is 7.  Still works!  Not a dull moment with this toy.  Whomever founded this at Fisher Price HAD to be a parent!  My familymembers call dibs for whomever has the next baby.  Great buy!!!!",5

Fisher Price Peek a Block Incrediblock,"My son has had this toy for almost a year and a half. He didn\'t really start playing with it until he was 12 months old, but since then he\'s played with it regularly. He likes the music and sounds, and I like the built-in storage for the blocks. There are a few mildly irritating issues with this toy. One, the motor is so loud that it\'s hard to hear the music even when it\'s on the louder setting. The other annoyance is that it\'s difficult to remove the blocks from the ""plinko"" side. Aside from those things, this has been a long-lived, well loved toy that has grown with my child from babyhood to toddlerhood.",4
Arm\'s Reach Little Palace Collection Co-Sleeper - Stratford,"Sad to say, yet another failed newborn marketing gimmic.  this promising co-sleeper failed...big time.  very difficult to put together, yet we wanted the best.  bottom-line.  this product is a waste of money/registry space.  our newborn didn\'t take to it in the least.  my advice if you get stuck with this product...iron it BEFORE you assemble it...and make sure you have ample space in a corner for it to collect dust.",1
Arm\'s Reach Little Palace Collection Co-Sleeper - Stratford,"We wanted a bassinet or co-sleeper for our little baby before putting her in a crib. We also did not want anything that was too frilly. This co-sleeper is not too big, so it was perfect for our little apartment. It also has wheels, just in case you want to move the co-sleeper from room to room. Our baby loved it and it has mesh around the bottom, just in case the baby\'s nose gets too close to the edge. It also has storage space on the bottom for sheets and blankets.It is a little weird to put together - I\'ve never seen so much velcro in my life to attach all the material, but besides that it was fine.",5
"Taggies Classic Little Taggies, Puppytime","This security blanket may turn into a child\'s and parent\'s worst nightmare.  Children can and do get their fingers into the loops and then proceed to twist them.  Often times they twist it so tightly that not only can they not get their fingers out without adult assistance, they cut off circulation to their finger in the process.  This requires immediate medical attention.  In fact, there is a manufacturing law that prohibits looped tags on children\'s clothing, accesories, and toys due to the health issue and the danger involved.  I wouldn\'t want to see anymore children loose fingers over this severe safety issue.  RN in Virginia",1

Arms Reach Clearvue Natural Co-Sleeper,"We have a room that is good sized, but a huge king sized bed, so we needed to save on space.  The only downfall to this bed is that while the legs do extend for tall beds, it wasn\'t tall enough for ours (captain\'s bed with drawers underneath).  I still had to step out and reach over and get her.This bed will roll from room to room if needed, has  GREAT space underneath for diapers, wipes, cloths, etc.  The sides each have a netting pouch for other small items.  When I bought it, it was only 99.00 - apparently it has caught on!  Price went up!",5

Unfortunately I picked another adorable pattern.  He doesn\'t like change.  So far he has rejected it, so I think I will have to get one just like his original.  That\'s O.K. because he has a new baby brother who is too little to know what it is for.  We\'ll save it for him.Warning to parents and Grandparents: Either buy 2 at a time, or when you come back, you\'ll have to buy the same pattern.",5

Peg Perego Stroller Travel Bag,used it last summer when going to eurorope. no issue fitting stroller once you take off wheels. room for a couple more itmes which always helps. i really liked it. do wish it had wheels but as long as you use a luggage cart for alyour stuff you are fine. only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is that the fabric is a little thin and not sure how many trips it will be able to handle. we are going to europe again in a few weeks so we get to try it out again ; ),4
Peg Perego Stroller Travel Bag,We bought the Peg Perego stroller travel bag for airplane trips with our Pliko Mini.  The Pliko Mini fits inside easily with room to spare. I like the extra space for airplane trips because we place our winter coats inside before gate checking the stroller bag.  The carry handles are nice and large enough.  We\'ve used this bag three times and only negative thing I can say is that a hole ripped in the bottom our last trip. I expect some duct tape will fix it fine for our next airplane trip.,4

Duo Diaper Bag - Ocean Stripe,"Before my daughter was born, I knew I needed a diaper bag to hold things for both of my children. This bag is awesome! It has 2 front pouches with magnets to keep them closed. It has to side pouches...one of which fits a toddler\'s sippy cup perfectly. There is a pocket that runs along the entire backside of the bag. In the main compartment, there are two additional pouches that fit diapers and pull ups or a travel baby wipe container. Along the sides of the main compartment are 2 zippered pouches as well. One is quite deep and the other is somewhat shallow. This bag can fit so much. I have a tendency to forget what I have put in it. I easily fit everything I need for my toddler and baby with room to spare! Another great feature is that this bag has handles that snap on to a stroller, so that you don\'t have to waste space under the seat. I recommend this diaper bag to any parent!!",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"While it did stop my son from sucking his fingers on one hand while it was on, he just moved to the other hand.  So this wasn\'t going to work without getting two which is a little expensive.  I also don\'t like the ties.  One time use doesn\'t work too well.  These need to be resuable.  Otherwise, I\'m going though at least 3 a day for meals only.",3
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I recommended this product to a coworker of mine whos three year old sucks her two middle fingers only stopping to eat and speak.  She was at a loss for what to do as it had gotten so bad that while sucking her fingers she was rubbing her nose and rubbed it raw.  She talked to her about her special glove arriving with bracelets in colors she could choose from.  After 3 plus weeks of wearing it, I noticed one day she was here and didnt have the glove on.  Sure enough I asked and she had stopped completely and her little nose looked all better too.  Her recommendation was to use positive reinforcement and to never take it off unless you have to or better while sleeping.  Her daughter didn\'t love it at first but once she saw she could still do everything else and pick her colors too she didn\'t mind.  I am glad this worked because it is not cheap. But I told her will save her tons in dentist bills and hassle later on.",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"This product is expensive but worth the cost! We were able to use the small size fit on our 2 year old--we were eager to intervene before his teeth, jaws and fingers became affected severely. Follow the written instructions to make sure that the fit is secure but comfortable otherwise your child might be able to pull it off or might become bruised from the wristbands. Our son cried a little and pleaded with us to remove it the first few days but that quickly subsided when he realized that we weren\'t going to take it off. The guard was kept on at all times including bathing and sleeping. We kept the guard clean by washing it during bath time with a sponge and throughout the day whenever we needed to wash our son\'s hands. He was able do his normal activities with it on (playing, eating etc.). We made sure to hold the hand with guard during walks so that he wouldn\'t feel like there was anything wrong with his hand. I would change the bands 2-3 times a week while he was asleep. Once a week I would take the guard off while our son was sleeping and swab it with alcohol before putting back on immediately. We kept the guard on his hand for nearly 8 weeks just to make sure that the habit was broken. By then, the guard\'s fingers were gnawed and torn and the straps were falling apart. But it worked. Now a year later, our son is happy and healthy and hasn\'t gone back to the habit despite being around a child who sucks her thumb.",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),My son is 6 and couldn\'t stop sacking his fingers...it was getting to where he was sacking them all the time...I purchased the finger guard and he was actually excited about it. Some nights where tougher for him but it\'s been about 3 weeks and he can sit on the couch watching t.v. and not think about sacking his fingers. We at I\'ll use it at night just in case but i am extremely happy and so is my son. I never thought i would ever see the day without his fingers in his mouth!,4
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I ordered this product with high expectations and it did not disappoint. Our soon to be five year old has been finger sucking since he was a few months old. Within the last year it became a huge issue as his front teeth (top and bottom) were starting to spread apart. The dentist warned us we needed to do something soon to prevent permanent damage. I searched online and after rejecting some potential options found the TGuard Fingerguard. My husband was extremely skeptical but I was hopeful after reading all the positive reviews. Well, it worked out great for us. After a night or two of putting up a fight my son finally accepted his finger sucking fate and we haven\'t looked back. It\'s been about two weeks since we\'ve stopped using the product and there hasn\'t been one sign of the finger sucking returning!",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"My daughter sucked her fingers and pulled her hair since she was a year old. I cannot say enough great things about this item!!! It was well worth the price and we purchased extra bands for it so she could have fun picking the colors. We used this for 5 weeks 24 hours a day, and now she no longer sucks her fingers or pulls her hair. The only downside is trying to explain to people what is on her hand. If your chils has a small wrist I suggest using 2 of the wristbands at a time.",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),We needed to stop a strong finger sucking habit in a 5 year old. Can\'t hurt those new teeth coming in. Nothing else worked so we went with this.

We\'ve tried everything iincluding orthodontics (an appliance in the roof of his mouth) to get him to stop. This was the first thing that actually made a difference. He started sucking a finger on his other hand, but not to the same degree. We can already see a difference in his front teeth. We are very happy with this purchase!",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"Having a child who sucks his fingers for comfort is not shameful but it is detrimental to their mouth structure. So, we decided to give the sea gland the have worked great. I really appreciated all the extra straps that came with it asit must be cleaned regularly.",4
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I purchased this for my 3 yr, 4 month old daughter.  The first two days were torture for her.  She screamed for two hours the first two nights and days.  The only time I removed it was at night after she had fallen to asleep to clean it.  I kept it on 24/7 for four straight weeks.  After removing it, she never sucked her fingers again, she completely forgot about the sucking sensation.  I highly recommend this product.",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),This is a great idea but my 3 year old is STUBBORN and after 2 weeks of constantly fighting over this we have take a break. I think if you could get them to wear this consistently it would work great. He would still put the devise in his mouth and has chewed almost all the way through the plastic. Hopefully we can try agai. And make it work next time...,3
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"Our three year old daughter has had two fingers in her mouth day and night basically since birth. We are only using at night for a month now and she stopped putting her fingers in her mouth for past two weeks. She still wants it on until her fingers healed. She had gnawed them so bad that it was red, raw and bleeding.",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I was honestly very skeptical about this product. My son was sucking his fingers since he was a month old.  He would suck them all night and all day,his fingers looked like little prunes 24x7.  When I enrolled him into pre-school (he would be 3 yrs old) i knew we needed to kick the habit for the sake of keeping him healthy. Knowing stickers and our standard reward system wouldn\'t work for his habit, I decided to opt for the finger guard. My son wore it day and night for 4 complete weeks, we only removed it for baths, at which time i would clean it with dishsoap and allow to dry before putting it back on. By the time four weeks had passed the guard was bitten and well worn.  We took it off and to our relief and surprise, it had worked! No more finger sucking!Here\'s a few tips to parents buying this product:- Follow the instructions and keep the guard on for the full amount of time instructed (3-4 weeks), and only remove to clean- Don\'t make a big deal out of the guard.  Even when other parents and kids would ask what the guard was we would simply say ""we\'re kicking a habit"". I never wanted my son to feel badly about wearing it so we never got into a conversation about it while he was there.- I think 3 years old was the perfect age for this ""intervention""- My son enjoyed picking out the color of the band he would wear with the guard, yours may too",5
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I can\'t speak for the actual product working yet as we\'ve only just received it but it is WAY too big for my seven year old.  He is an above average size kid so I trusted the size indicated by the company-which was a mistake.  Tonight I ordered a medium.  I would say the large would fit a nine year old or larger.  I\'ll check it on my nine year old tomorrow and let you know.  Or if your child has chubbier fingers.  My childs fingers seem to be a tiny bit on the  smaller side due to his sucking them.As far as how it is made, it is very well made-soft thick plastic and easy to clean.  On a side note, because we are breaking a life long habit for this little guy, it is hard on him.  He had a rough today partially because he was frustrated with not being able to suck his fingers and then couldn\'t even console himself...by sucking on his fingers.  So we aren\'t expecting this to be magical and know it will take some patience but really hope it works for him as nothing else has-bribing, taping, putting yucky stuff on his nails, etc.  My mom thought he would grow out of it but we can\'t wait any longer.  His front teeth are starting to come in crooked and I figured this is a lot less expensive than braces!Hope this helps someone else when it comes to ordering the correct size.",4
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I spent a lot of money on this and it didn\'t work at all.  My daughter couldn\'t get to her fingers, so she just sucked and chewed the plastic off.  She still sucked her fingers after using this.  If you have dental insurance it would be better to just have the dentist put a thing in her mouth, that every time she sucks on her fingers it pokes her fingers.",1
FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I was very skeptical and leery about purchasing this for my daughter who sucks her two middle fingers.  I really had a hard time justifying the cost of this purchase, but I figured I might as well give it a try as nothing was really working with her.  When we first took this out of the box she thought it was fun and was eager to put this on (she\'s a small two year old).  Then we strapped it around her wrist and the tears began to flow!  She HATED that she couldn\'t get this off.  So we told her that we would take it off but if she put her fingers in her mouth it would go back on.  About 10 minutes later, her fingers were back in her mouth and just showing her the finger guard was enough for her to stop sucking her fingers.  So for us, it took 2 minutes of wearing it and lots and lots of ""threats"" of ""do you want your glove?"" to get her to stop sucking her fingers.  The downfall to this product though is that unless you plan to have your child wear this constantly (as recommeded), you\'re going to throw away a lot of the wrist bands as you put it on and take it off.  We knew that when we put it on our child she wasn\'t going to wear it all the time (the wrist part went very low on her skinny little arms and I was not going to make her wear that all the time...it didn\'t look comfortable!); so we ended up tying an extra shoe string through the loops and tied it around her wrist.  Yes, I know a shoe string can be a choking hazzard.  One more downfall, her fingers are small and skinny so I was afraid it would be moving in the guard and rubbing at her fingers.  Also, she try putting a child\'s fingers in the guards when they are mad, squirming and holding their fingers down...you have to pry them into it.  Not fun for anyone.  Overall, I don\'t want my child to have to wear this constantly, but it really did work and helped us to get her to stop sucking her fingers!",4

"CoCaLo Switch Plate, Sports Fan",It goes perfectly with the nursery decor.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  It was easy to put on.  No complaints.,4

Graco Vie4 Stroller in Super Saurus,"I am very pleased with this stroller so far.  I have three children and have used a Graco literider stroller for all of them.  I purchased this to finish using with my third child(and hopefully another one in the future).  I am amazed at how nice it is, how smooth it pushes...I can use one hand to push it.  I love the large storage basket underneath that is easily assessible.  It is so easy to get a child in and out of the stroller with the way the child\'s tray opens.  We have a Mercury Villager.  To make it fit in the back of the van, without laying it down, I just undo one side of the child\'s tray and turn the front wheels so that they are perpendicular to the back wheels.",5
Graco Vie4 Stroller in Super Saurus,It is very nice. Good for shopping. A little bulkier than I thought. Had a hard time fitting it into my Mitsubishi trunk. It does well on every terrain. Would need another light weight stroller to compliment this one.,4
"Glenna Jean Neutron 4 piece Set (Includes quilt, bumper, fitted sheet, crib skirt)","My husband and I loved this bedding from the beginning, mainly because of the Orange color in the bedding. We even ordered a custom wall decal in Orange to match the color of the bedding. Unfortunately when the bedding arrived, the color was red not Orange.  Thankfully we were able to change the color of the decal and no harm was done.The color of the bedding needs to be described in the description of the product.  Other then that we love it.  Having the decal from the image available would be great too",3
"Graco Vie4 Stroller, Betsey","I bought this stroller separately from the infant carrier but they fit together perfectly.  I love it.  The wheels move in all directions but I like the way you can lock the wheels when going over grass, etc.",5
"Graco Vie4 Stroller, Betsey",I absolutely love this stroller. It is so easy to use and I have gotten so many complements on it. It is easy to fold and put the baby in. I wish I have had this stroller two babies ago.,5
"Graco Vie4 Stroller, Betsey","and we\'ve had quite a few of them.I recently purchased this stroller and the Graco Metrolite for a trip to Disney World.  I chose the Metrolite for my son and the Vie4 for my daughter.  I would have given it one star, but I gave it two for the pink fabric.This stroller does not fold compactly and neatly.  It is very large while folded, mainly because the tray (that cannot be easily detached) sticks out from the stroller and takes up a lot of room in the storage area of the vehicle.The worst part about this stroller is how the seat is slanted forward.  My daughter spent an entire week at Disney World being held in her stroller only by the 3-point harness straps.  It was very uncomfortable for her and there was no way we could fix it.I wish we had bought two Metrolites.  Those are awesome strollers!I\'d pass on the Vie4, unless you HAVE to have the girly fabric and your child will only be in it for short periods of time.  Oh, and you drive an extra large SUV so there\'s room for the stroller AND other items in the back.",2
"Graco Vie4 Stroller, Betsey",Bought this over a year ago for my daughter. I did a lot of research and I am glad I pulled the trigger on this one. In my opinion the expensive strollers aren\'t worth it and now that I have had this over a year it is still going strong. Only con I can think of that is is bulky but it fits in my trunk so not really a big deal for me. If you are looking for a good dependable stroller look no further!,4
Graco Wood Frame Pack \'n Play with Bassinet &amp; Changing Table in Marlowe,"This pack and play has been great.  I love that it has more of a ""furniture"" look with the wooden legs.",5
Graco Wood Frame Pack \'n Play with Bassinet &amp; Changing Table in Marlowe,all my babies have used this and it has kept well and travels well.  the only thing i dont like is that there is no storage place or easy way to transport accessories.,4

"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet, Ambrosia","I really like this travel lite crib.  We had a full size graco pack n play when my son was born, but now that we have moved to a smaller space, we needed something a little more space conscious.  I looked high and low for a cute travel lite crib and on a whim bought this one because it had a nice look to it.  When I set it up (very standard pack n play set up) I was initially quite shocked at the boldness of the pattern and darkness of the brown.  I think the pattern is a bit obnoxious in person, though it looks nice the photos.  The brown is also quite dark.  Now that I have had it set it for a few days, I am getting used to it.  The toys are beyond lame (a stuffed star and moon?) and I have simply replaced the toys with bears from the Graco winsdor PNP.  Overall, it\'s very nice and the pattern is nicer than most of the others out there.  It is a good bit smaller than the regular size pack n play and fits through my door ways easily.",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","My baby girl loves this swing so much. I looked a long time to find one that did not solely rely on batteries for its power source and was pleased to find this one.  It has so many features it can seem a little much or so I thought. The sound features on here are excellent. It helps to calm my daughter when other things have not, she is very fond of the heartbeat. I love that there is a volume control on it so that it\'s not too loud for her or me. I have not used the MP3 player feature so I can\'t comment on that at the moment but if I ever do use it then I will update this post.My one and only issue with this is how it swings. It\'s not smooth and what I mean by that is that it swings for a while and slows to an almost stop then does a little lurch forward to get its self moving again. The movement is why I only gave it four stars and not five. The swing I had with my son was one smooth movement and I liked that much better than the way this one works. I love the fact that I don\'t have to take her out of her car seat after a car trip if she is asleep since the seat fits right into the swing. It\'s a cool feature to have and can make a wonderful end to a car trip especially one of those trips used to lull the little one to sleep.This has a very small footprint compared to the old one I was used to and it\'s nice to not need a large portion of my floor space for the swing as I have a rambunctious five-year old who tends to run without looking where he is going. The lining is so soft and adorable it keeps the little one very cozy. The toys are cute but she is too young for them at the moment but I know they will be handy as soon as she can begin to ""play"" with things.Overall I would say you can\'t go wrong with this swing!",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Great idea, Great quality swing, but every time I put my son in it he cries.I wish he liked it. I\'d say give it a try if you think your baby will like it.",3
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008",This is an amazing product!  It does all that it describes and more.  the noise that others have whined about it pretty normal for an electronic item. They should have used a wind-up swing back in my day.  I couldn\'t wait to get this for my granddaughter.  It is soothing and comfortable for her.  The music and other sounds is high quality.  the seat is plush and large...easy to remove and adjust.  Every detail has been so carefully thought out to give the baby a peaceful experience.  I wish they made one large enough for ole granny. Thanks Graco!!,5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008",I read many reviews on every site I could find before ordering this swing and overall I am happy with it.  My son is 7 weeks old and we have been using it since the day we brought him home.  First of all it is very easy to assemble even when you are 9 months pregnant.  Colors are neutral and go well with almost everything. The soft plush cover sits directly on the hard plastic seat so I felt it was lacking padding.  I am paranoid about my child having a flat head so I added some foam from a craft store. I love that it plugs into an outlet so no need for batteries. I did notice that when I first tried my swing before my son was born that it stalled when set on 2 and the motor croaked and seemed loud for what I expected.  I had read about this online and called Graco.  The woman I spoke to was very nice and ordered a new motor for me free of charge.  She informed me that the next shipment they had would be in 6 weeks. It took about 2 months to get the new motor and it is whisper quiet compared to the original motor.  We used the swing with the original croaking motor until the new one arrived and it worked fine on any setting higher than 2.  My son loves the swing and it takes up less space than the old swing we had.  I also like that we can put our carseat on the swing base and when not using our carseat it fits under the swing perfectly. I gave it 4 stars for lack of padding and the fact that we had to get a new motor.,4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Our daughter has been using this swing for 7 months and we still absolutely love it.  This swing has been such a lifesaver; our daughter takes all of her daytime naps in it.  The slight recline is great for reflux.  The white noise is awesome and we actually contacted Graco to find out if we could get the same white noise mp3\'s to play elsewhere throughout the house and for outings to help our baby sleep.  Customer Service gave me this website where you can download free mp3\'s:  [...]For play time, we like to sit our baby in the swing and turn on the swing\'s lively playtime music.  Then she can situp and face us as we play with toys and such.  The incline on the seat is great for preventing spitups while playing.We had a hard time with the swaddler and just use the Kiddopotamus ones instead because they have the cutout for the buckle.  I love that when we come back from a car trip we can attach our Graco Snugride car seat to the swing to keep our baby sound asleep.  The neutral color scheme is great because it matches so well in my living room as opposed to the bright pink, green, or other crazily-colored swings.My only complaint is that I cannot find those darn Mix \'N Match toys for the toy bar anywhere!  Graco lists them as replacement parts but they\'re ALL unavailable to purchase through their website!  That is the only negative comment I have about the swing, though.  It has really been a lifesaver.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","We bought this swing before my baby was born. I was nervous, of course, having to pay so much for a swing not knowing if he is going to love it or hate it. After he was born, we didn\'t really start using it until he was about 2-3 weeks old. He hated it, he would scream and cry, and would not want anything to do with the swing! Needless to say, we were a little disappointed and was even thinking of selling it. 2 months past by and the swing sat at the corner, not getting much use. And then sometime in the 3rd month, we decided to try again to see if my baby will like it, and he loves it!! The vibration on the chair and the swing sooth him when he is a little cranky or can\'t fall asleep on his own. We think that he didn\'t like it when he was younger (1-2 month old) was because he was uncomfortable sitting in it. Now that he is older (5 months old) and can sit better, he love sitting in it while the chair swing back and forth. My advice is, if it doesn\'t work at the beginning, be patience and try again later. Sometimes... baby just don\'t really know what they want!",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Our son (now 3 months old) never really enjoyed this swing.  From birth he would sit in it for a maximum of 10 minutes and then want to get out.  For some reason it did not lull him to sleep.  It is very well-made and has a lot of great options/settings, but it just wasn\'t the right swing for us.  On the other hand, he loved the the cheap Fisher Price swing at my mother-in-law\'s house.  My theory is that he prefers the front to back motion of a swing versus this side to side motion.  I would suggest that you try this out before purchasing.",2
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","The idea behind this swing is a great idea. The assembly is easy and the swing is a nice looking swing. The problem is the motor. it makes a loud grinding noise which can be heard over the music(and I know all swings makes some noise, this is different) It also stalls on low speeds. We did not notice the noisy motor in the store because of the music in the store but when this item is in the home it is a different story. We returned this item and purchased the fisher price papasan swing in pink. We are much happier now.",2
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","My daughter LOVES this swing, I have put her in it since I brought her home from the hospital. My son hated the swing when he was a baby, I am so thankful she loves being in the swing. Yeah, the motor is a little loud but with my tv on and the music on for her I don\'t here it.  She\'s 4 months old already and still loves it, she\'s starting to play with the toys.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","My husband and I were excited to purchase this product after viewing the online demo. Last night, we went to the store to get a SweetPeace of our very own. We rushed home, anxious to assemble our new soothing center. As soon as we plugged the item into the socket, I could tell there was something VERY wrong. The product was making a strange ""frog-like croaking"" sound that was very loud. At first, I thought it was one of the nature sounds that comes with the swing. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that the nature sound button was in the ""off"" position. This thing was loudly croaking on its own, just by swinging normally! I figured that I had received a defective product and was determined to correct the situation in the morning.At 9 a.m this morning, I was on the phone with Graco, whom assured me that the swing should operate quietly. Being gullible, my husband and I braved the snow in an effort to exchange our Sweetpeace for another one. However, once we got to the store, we convinced an employee to plug-in their floor model and waited. Sure enough, over the store noise and Musak playing, we could hear the loud, annoying and distracting croaking sound. My husband and I returned our SweetPeace and received a refund. I can\'t justify paying $170.00 for a noisy swing that is guaranteed to drive one crazy after the first 5 minutes of operation.",2
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I received the Sweetpeace as a baby shower gift. It is nice, I love that it operates on either batteries or an ac adaptor. The womb sounds are great as well as the music. Has Mp3 player capability so that you can make your own music selections.  The seat has 3 different reclining positions, however, in my opinion even the position that reclines the most is not back far enough. The seat does not really cradle the baby. For example, I also have the Graco Lovin\' Hug infant swing. My little one will sleep much longer in the Lovin\' Hug swing strictly because the seat is in a much more comfortable reclining position. Overall, the Sweeetpeace has alot of nice features. I think that Graco should modify the seat a bit to provide a more relaxed and comfortable position for a resting baby.",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I loved this swing. We used it for about 5 months...daily! I loved that you could position the seat to face front to back or side to side. There are also many sounds and speeds to choose from. Honestly, I thought that the mp3 capabilities were ridiculous, until I used it. I made my daughter her own playlist and she loved it almost as much as I did. I also enjoyed that the seat vibrated. It kept my daughter very content, even if she was not swinging. I would recommend this swing to anyone. It is AMAZING!!! I only have one child, but it I have another anytime soon, I would definately consider buying this product again, or something that has the same features.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Hi,I tell ya this baby was near $170 or so when I had my baby. It was my big shower gift. It was a complete lifesaver and the baby would only sleep in this when we first arrived home from hospital for the little times he did sleep it was golden and the only time I got a moment to sleep was when he was in here but after first month we tried out a bouncer seat and he preferred that over this. Would I register for it again? totally. every now and then probably 3 times since the first month (he is now 4 months) will he let you put him in it to swing. I think he considers it a ""little baby"" swing. He has a regular model swing now that he is obsessed with. He seems to choose everything over this now. He loved the womb sounds and the watersounds that sounded like a toilet constantly flushing. I never put it on over speed three because I was aware of this models motor burning out pretty quick and I never had one moments trouble with it. Takes up alot of space and I am always stumping my toes on it. This thing does have a loud volume range and it seems the louder i could get it the better my baby liked it. It does let you drop your graco travel center carseat in the base even though I  never did. Being a first time mom I was obsessed that the batteries would give out and wanted this for the c adapter. I didn\'t know that running hours a day the c and d cells actually last FOREVER in baby products....... well I always use good ones. I would probably pass this along but saving it for next child because of high cost",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","This is a really great product and I would absolutely recommend it to others.  I had considered buying one for a long time but hesitated due to the price and because we were given a different swing as a gift.  One thing I remember researching was whether it would work with the Chicco carseat/travel system that we chose.  It does not.  We received the Sweetpeace swing as a hand-me-down gift and love it; we just cannot use the carseat transfer feature.It doesn\'t take away from the general value of this product, but I wanted to put this info out there since it was not available when I was searching for it months ago!",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","As a mom of a three year old and a 2 month old I have gone through my share of baby products and swings. I had this swing with both of my boys and have found it to be the most used product we own. We literally use it the day we get home from the hospital and we even used it up until my oldest son was 2 for nights he was congested. It is great to have congested and sick babies sleep in the swing because they are at an incline.ProsEverything is washable (a must with babies!!!)I love that the swing rocks side to side instead of front to back - this is supposed to mimic how a baby moves in your wombThere are multiple seat recline positionsThere are six speed settings (my first child loved to rock slow and my second loves to go fast!!)The seat actually comes out of the base and can be carried around the house if baby is sleeping. (We keep the swing downstairs and if baby is asleep I just carry him upstairs in the chair- obviously make sure they are buckled in)The chair vibrates (babies love this)Features 15 different sounds and MP3 and iPod plug-in for custom playlist (both of my babies loved the heartbeat noise)Offers safety harness, removable infant head support, and canopyCompatible with these Graco infant car seats: SnugRide, SnugRide 30, SnugRide 32, SnugRide 35, and the Infant SafeSeat (if you are leaving soon or just getting home and want to keep baby in the carseat you can set it in the base..amazing!!)Works with a wall plug as well as batteriesAlso, if you want to store this after your first baby just buy a car seat travel case and the swing will fit nicely in it. We did this and stored the seat in the garage until our second was born.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","One specific thing we were looking for in a swing was the option to plug it in so we wouldn\'t have to spend a fortune on batteries. We only found about 3 swings on the market with this feature and one of those was specifically for a girl(we have a boy) so that one was automatically out. The sweetpeace was the more expensive of the two options we had left, but after long debate we decided to splurge and we are soooo glad we did.The music is great, not annoying at all. The swinging movement is much more natural than any other swing I have ever seen. It slows down, sometimes it even stops, and then starts right back up soothing my baby to sleep every time! This thing was a life saver for those nights that he just could not sleep, which meant I could not sleep LOL.Some of the features seem like a little overkill, but my husband thinks it is great. I would definitely recommend this swing to any soon to be parents!",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Just got this swing in today. The music options are great the seat seems comfy to the little one! I only have an issue with the motor, it has a ruff squeak when the swing is on. If the music is loud enough you can\'t hear the motor, but yes it is loud enough to be heard. Doesn\'t seem to bother my baby but it sure does bother me.",3
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Its an excellent product as soon as my baby sleep he sleeps the only 2 draw backs are when its swinging it sound like something is scratching and need to grease it to stop the sound annoying for some but I am fine with it. Also keep in mind your baby is not going to be flat, I thought one of the three positions will be flat but the flat most position is the car seat position. I would not recommend it for sleeping for more than 3-4 hrs.",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Bottom line, I am able to sleep more than 5 hours a night with a 4 week old baby. That alone is worth the money!",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008",Unbelievable that anybody would recommend this swing.  The motor to it is extremely loud and annoying - the swing is upstairs and in another room -(2 rooms) away and I can hear the motor!!!!  I bought this b/c of the good reviews - ?????  Are you kidding me.  Everything else about it is nice - HOWEVER - IF IT IS ANNOYING WITH THE MOTOR BEING TOO LOUD WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE REST OF IT\'S FEATURES?  So - if you want a nice quiet swing - DO NOT BUY THIS BASED ON ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS.  This swing is exceptionally noisy - beyond what is acceptable in a swing product.  Nothing peaceful about this swing.,1
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008",LOVE this swing. I bought it 4 months ago and never had any problems with the sound or swings speed. I have a big baby so I think other swings with lower speeds may not be able to move! I like being able to switch the chair out with her carseat when shes sleeping from the car. For whatever reason our little hanging bear always comes off so we dont use it often. Nor do we use the swaddle blanket even though I do use other swaddle blankets at bed time. We often rub against the front of the swing when we pass by and accidently turn on the vibration so we ended up taking the batteries didnt seem to make a difference with the baby. She pulled the teether off the string and I keep meaning to put it back on its not that big of a deal. I love the other audio option I put my zune with her swing a lot of things are only IPOD compatible. The biggest plus is that it plugs into the wall. Im sure we wouldve went thru buckets full of batteries by now because we use it everyday. The only thing I wish was different was that you could order toys from graco and replace the teether or whatever the little green circle thing is because my baby is getting bigger and gets a little bored with the mirror. But this swing has way more pluses then negatives. I would recommend this swing to anyone.,5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008",This item is the nicest swing I have ever owned. My daughter loved it. I wish I had it for all of my kids. I know there were some motor issues with the first ones on the market but mine wasnt like that. It may cost a little more but really I would have spent double the price because it really is that nice. I would only change a couple things but really not much. not all the straps come off to be washed so i had to take mine apart a little to wash the straps cause kids spit up on the belts. It would be cool if the circle on the base was smaller so you could take it fully asembled through door ways and if it had some type of handle to pull it around instead of just the little ledge cause thats not to easy to hold on to. In the end this is the best swing ever. The AC adapter is amazing. Part of it broke on me and I need to call the company but for now I am using the batteries which have lasted forever.,5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I got mine on craigslist for half price. The motor was working intermittently and slipping so I called Graco and ordered a new motor (the entire tower) for 50 dollars. It is an older model, or so the customer service rep. told me, but even with a brand new motor mine still makes a pretty loud noise, so much that you have to turn up the TV to be able to hear it over the noise. It will still slow while swinging and almost stop, then starts again, so it seems to be a design flaw and not due to a run down motor. I also think the vibrating chair is even louder than the swinging motion.My two week old can still fall asleep despite the noise, and it is one of the few places he will stay asleep for hours. The music entertains my 3 year old, and he likes to sing along. The sound quality is nice, and it does seem a bit loud to me while the baby is sleeping, but not loud enough to disturb him. He also likes to watch the toy hanging from the canopy.",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","This product is absolutely amazing. I\'ve never seen a better product for babies and I wish I had had this for my first baby. The technology used in this product is amazing. The swing is actually designed to mimic the rhythem (spelling?) of a person walking. The seat is set up like a cocoon around the newborn. The best part, in my opinion, is the sounds. You have several options. You can download your own songs to an ipod and plug it in, there are classical tunes preprogrammed into the machine, and there are a series of differant white noises to choose from such as rain, womb sounds, ocean, ect. My husband and I loved the white noises so much we\'ll probably end up using it even after the baby is done with it.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Purchased unit less than 2 weeks ago.  Received very quickly, within 5 days.  Initial thoughts are that this unit is very nice looking, with plenty of gadgets, probably too many.  Read most of the reviews for this item and was impressed enough to purchase.  After assembly, I noticed that the swing made a croaking noise like stated in other reviews.  Being very technically/mechanically inclined I looked closely at the tower/motor assembly during the swinging motion and noticed that the unit was being twisted...much like if you were to twist left and right, your body twists from the waist.  This is what was happening.  The motor housing being plastic, was rubbing on the metal base ring while twisting.  To fix the croaking noise, I removed the motor housing from the base.  Where the housing mounts to the base ring are two arches, one on left and one on right.  I took a piece of felt (4x6 inch) and cut two smaller pieces to sit on top of the metal ring where it fits into the arches.  I then pressed down on the motor housing and forced it over the felt.  I now had the felt firmly wedged between the rings and the arches.  It was a little tight due to the plastic being molded to fit the metal rings only.  After all this I fully reassembled the unit and turned it on.  FIXED!!  The only thing audible was the motor as it moved the arm.  Will update as we use it.  Good luck to anyone else who has this problem.",4
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008",This swing makes my life easier. I love that I can use my car seat in it as well. Colors are perfectly neutral and the fabric is super soft. Plus the motor is heavy duty. I have had the swing for 1 week now and love it. All the bells and whistles are highly useful. The only draw backs is that it would be nice to have a mobile. I love not needing to use batteries. Can\'t say enough positive things about this swing!!!!!,5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Its a very nicely made with some very unique movements in it. I bought this as I have two storied house and wanted something on each floor. Graco swing terribly failed as an option for me.For some reason my baby didnt like it at all.I had purchased a cradle & swing (aquarium theme)by FP, and its having some very bright colors in that as compared to very dull and light colors in Graco one. My son loved to swing and sleep in that but didnt stayed even for 15 mins continuously in this one. FP swing was truly a great help in those nights when he cried whole night. FP Swing was the only thing that could soothe him.",2
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","We received the Soothing Center as gift and we absolutely love it.  More importantly, our baby loves it, too.  Here\'s what makes it great...- Very easy assembly.  I am ""mechanically challenged"" to say the least, but I had no problem putting this together-even at 9 1/2 months pregnant.- Comes with a power cord.  So many of the other swings we looked at only ran off of batteries.- Well made.  The soothing center has so many nice features.  The lining is incredibly soft and plush and in classic, neutral colors.  In addition to the safety straps, it has a cross bar that raises from both sides, easily comes out and comes with a mirror and teething toy attached. There is also a pacifier attachment. The cradle is shaped much like a car seat and removes with ease to turn and allow your baby to swing in different directions. In addition to the music, it has a vibration feature with adjustible speeds. The sweet bear-shaped headrest is wonderful for keeping our newborn\'s head positioned correctly. It even has a large, adjustable canopy for shielding the little one\'s eyes from the light.- The music is wonderful!  Many nursery favorites, but done in classy piano arrangements.  There is even classical music and (our favorite) an Irish folk song.  The music gives our h",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I can not say enough positive things about this swing!!!!! I got the Sweet Peace Swing as a baby shower gift for my son, who is now 3 1/2 years old.  We used it all the time for him, especially to put him to sleep when he was younger.  The music always soothed him and the rocking back and forth knocked him right out.  It was our savior when we needed to sleep.  One of the best things about it is that the round seat comes out and you can put your car seat (we used graco)right in it.  This helped when my husband and I were getting ready to go out, we could get him ready, put him in, turn it on, and finish getting ready ourselves and he would be good to go.  Same thing when he wasn\'t a good sleeper we could take him for a car ride, then bring him in, set the car seat in the frame, & the rocking would keep him asleep, thus we got to sleep!  When I found out I was having twins (they are 23 months apart from my son and now 16 months old) I almost bought a second swing.  Thankfully I had a friend who had the exact same swing, so she lent me hers (saving us the extra money, but it would have been worth it).  When my girls were small I would even swaddle them in the round seat facing each other and they would sleep in it forever.  In 3 1/2 years I have never found one thing I didn\'t like about this swing, and I\'m picky.  Our last addition to the family is due in 2 more months and I am looking forward to taking it out & knowing that it will be my extra pair of hands. PS My son (now 34 pounds) has even climbed in it from time to time, although I wouldn\'t recommend it, and it hasn\'t broken, so I would say it\'s incredibly durable as well.  Another cool thing about the swing is the ipod compatibility, to play your music on the swing\'s speakers. I hooked it into my iphone on Pandora a few times, but mostly just preferred the sounds that came on the swing so much that I didn\'t use it often. Definitely a cool bonus feature.  Did I mention that I love this swing?UPDATEMy baby...ahem toddler, who is now 14 months old still uses the sound machine for EVERY single nap & bedtime. The seat has been stored away. I used the swinging mechanism (with her swaddled) to put & keep her asleep until she was 7 months old. My ""older"" kids, then 2 years old twins & then 4 year old son managed to break the swinging mechanism due to too much horseplay on it, they put WAY too much weight on it constantly (they would hop in for rides). I didn\'t correct them because they were having fun and I knew I had gotten my money\'s worth out of it! 4 1/2 years later though & I still use the sound machine every day, most days it goes 24/7 with the rainforest noise!",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I had a Fisher Price Papasan Cradle Swing and bought this one when my second child came along. I think it would be great for extremely fussy babies, but it\'s way over the top for your average swing. There are too many functions and it\'s very loud and robotic. The car seat adapter would be useful if you have a fussy baby, but then along, s/he\'s sure to wake up as soon as the car is turned off anyway! I returned the swing and bought a second papasan swing instead.",2
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I LOVE this product.  My son is 12 weeks now.  He\'s been using it for a month.  I wish I had found it sooner.  He HATED the traditional swing.  I needed SOMETHING he would sleep in during the day (or even just be HAPPY in) so that I could chase my toddler.  This was the answer.  It\'s nice because there are 6 speeds.  There are also different positions for the cradle/carrier.  The carrier is MUCH nicer than the seats on the other swings.  The arm of the swing goes in an arc motion, making it more like the natural motion of Mom.  The motor is a bit noisy and the music settings loud.  However, the motor noise is rhythmic and a little soothing to baby.  Overall, if you have a ""high-need"" baby and not a ""crib baby,"" this is the best swing ever.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","We love this item!! Its a swing, bouncer and soother all in one! From the ability to swaddle the baby in the swing - to the ability to switch the direction and interchange the seat with the carseat!!It doesn\'t take up much space, and can be taken apart easy to travel or store. Some people complain about the noise..... Come on people!! Obviously they have never had a baby swing before.... it makes less noise than any swing we\'ve ever had. Its worth every penny! I just wish they would have had these when I had my now 3yr old daughter!",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","very well made, perfect.I love the optionsSoft and the colors are perfectonly one down fall its a little loud when swinging but most swings are.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","We owned a graco sweetpeace with our first child, it was given to us secondhand from a friend. This swing was a lifesaver as my now 2 year old loved to be in motion, she spent many nights sleeping and swinging all night. We used this swing daily for the first eight months, yes I said 8 months. My daughter was still in it when she was somewhat mobile, she loved the music, the motion everything about this swing. We acutally blew the motor in it from a) using it so much and b) my daughter being over the wieght limit and still in itI am now pregnant with #2 and we have already purchased another one of these swingsSince our first one was second hand we did not have the swaddler or the head rest but never missed either one of them",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","When I got this product I was impressed at first but then after everything was set up I went to run the swing and then i relized the motor to the unit was not working at all, it just made a humming noise and then refused to move.Called customer service and after answering about 45 minutes of questions they are sending me another motor unit (four to six weeks for delivery)and we know what that means when a baby dosent have a swing. headache sleepness and exhaustion for parentsCustomer service was excellent. Quality of unit is poor. Thats why I give it three stars. Would be very hesistent to purchase another graco product with electrical parts",3
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","Like many others here have stated its hit and miss as to whether or not you get a good tower on the first try. I called Graco and they sent a new tower to replace the faulty original but this one is still too noisy to have in the same room as your television. The quality of the speaker is not that great so playing music from your ipod really doesnt sound that great, and how many will actually use that feature anyway. In hindsight I would save the money and opt for something a little cheaper.",2
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","The people who say it makes only a little bit of noise must be deaf. It make a grinding, irritating noise. I ceiling fan that is 10x as powerful doesn\'t make 10% of this noise. If it was a cheap, low priced product, I could understand. But this is supposed to be the best in its category. Maybe that put our expectations higher. IF so, so be it. We were very happ with all of our other products, but this one fails the test!",1
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","So I bought this swing because of all the great reviews two years ago for my first daughter who is now 22 months old. I researched it a lot and watched the videos on Graco\'s website. In theory, the swing seems like a great product and it all makes perfect sense - you can change the seat to how your child would like to swing (except it doesn\'t have the traditional back and forth swing but swings more in an arc), it has a vibration in the swing, great music and sounds (heart beat, water, rain etc) and is pretty solid.Unfortunately, my first daughter didn\'t like swinging in it at all and cried whenever I put her in.  I tried every option and I even ended up sleeping with the swaddling blanket as suggested.  Nothing worked.  We ended up just using the chair on the floor and rocking her manually (when she would tolerate it).  Although marketed for a newborn, the swing is a bit strong for a newborn (and a bit too upright) and I would suggest to aim to use it for a 3 month old and older.  I thought that it was just my daughter who didn\'t like swinging, but when I tried her in a friend\'s swing, she loved it.I had my second daughter 3 months ago, and the same thing happened.  She hates the swing and cries whenever she\'s in it.  Sometimes she\'ll sit in it and look at herself in the mirror that comes with the play bar, but that\'s about it.  I took her to the store and tried out the cheaper swings and she loved them.  So my recommendation is that you wait until your baby is born and try them in the swing at the store first to see if they like it.I really wish my kids had liked this swing because it seemed like a great swing, but they both preferred swings that actually swing (i.e. hang from above).  Incidentally, my toddler likes to swing in it now (and it\'s powerful enough to work), but only for a few seconds - she still prefers the swings at the park.",3
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I\'ve highly recommended the Sweetpeace to all family and friends excpecting their first baby.  The Sweetpeace kept our baby happy & secure, swinging gently to soothing music allowing me to complete simple errands in peace.  I love the feature where you can use your own MP3s, but even the pre-programmed selections are sufficient to keep your little one happy.When I needed to make some lunch, go grab the mail or even go to the bathroom, I knew that my baby was safe for the moment that I may be away from her.  I often joke to friends that the Sweetpeace was a great ""baby sitter"" and I actually really did feel like the it was an extra pair of hands to help me out.  But as with any good thing, never have too much of it at once -- we only kept our baby in the Sweetpeace for a maximum of about 30-mins. each time; it\'s not meant for the baby to take his/her naps in, as the sitting position isn\'t the best for proper growth and development.  But for the 30-mins. that you use it, you\'ll be able to enjoy the freedom of doing things around the house with both of your arms!",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008","I am currently borrowing this item from a friend.  Totally worth the money and I would have bought it years ago if I knew how great it is.  I tried a bouncy seat and a swing for my older daughter when she was a baby and they were ok.  For my second daughter now this item is excellent.  Now I can attend to my older daughter and have my hands free now to do other things, like cook, e-mail, and write this review.This item has 6 speeds of swing, and four different swing positions.  There are options for music, ipod attachment, and sounds of water and what sounds like the womb.Buy this, or add it to your baby registry.  it will make your life easier.",5
"Graco Safe Seat Infant Car Seat, Portica","My son is 4 weeks old and has been enjoying his seat.  He isn\'t one bit fussy in it and it is realy easy to lock into place!  My only complaint is that it seems a bit on the heavy side.  Other than that, its great and my husband and I are happy with it.",5
"Graco Safe Seat Infant Car Seat, Portica","My daughter LOVES this car seat.We had a Graco SnugRide when we had my first son and he loved it. My parents gave me a different SnugRide with a matching double stroller when we had my second son. He hated the car seat. He would cry from the second we put the car seat with him in it in the car to the second we took the car seat out. My M-I-L said it was because he didn\'t like riding backward. Sure enough when we switched him to the Britax when he was 20 lbs and a year old he was fine.My daughter used the same SnugRide as my second son for her first 4 months. She did the same thing, she cried from the second I put her in the car to the second I took her out. I mean really crying. It was awful. We drove 5 hours for a summer vacation and we couldn\'t take it. Not even sitting next to her distracting her helped. My M-I-L said she was the same as my second son but this time I wasn\'t so sure.I read all the reviews on Amazon for cheap car seats all the way to the super expensive ones. The SafeSeat had the best reviews so we went ahead and ordered it and had it shipped to our hotel 2nd day for only a few dollars extra.Well she LOVES it. She is content to ride in it and sometimes even falls asleep in it. What a huge difference. Riding in the car is pleasant for everyone now :).Maybe the second SnugRide was just uncomfortable. It didn\'t feel bad there was nothing poking her, but there must have been something, maybe the way she rested in it. Not sure. My poor second son.Anyway, we love this car seat. The only thing we don\'t really like is the plastic window in the canopy that allows you to see the baby. I get why it is there but right now it is summer and the poor sun beats down on her little head, so we just cover it with a blanket. Problem solved.So we love this car seat. It seems more roomy and we like the color. It doesn\'t get super hot when we leave it in the car since the padding and the straps are a silver color and not black like the last two Graco\'s we had. I highly recommend it.",5
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Other reviewers have said this is loud.  Yeah, that is a selling point for me.  I don\'t want a whisper quiet humidifier.  I am looking for moisture and white noise and this delivers both.  I am not crazy about the design.  It is a little hard to fill, but you get used to it.  We ended up buying a second identical one for the baby.  We actually had to send one back as it leaked.  Amazon couldn\'t make it easier to return things.  Be sure you tighten the cap with all of your might and place a tray under the humidifier until you get the hang of it.  We could have easily ruined a chest of drawers if I hadn\'t put a tray under the leaky one.",4
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I purchased this for my son\'s room because it seemed to be the easiest to clean out of all the ones I looked at.  I should have checked the reviews first because this ended up being a huge disappointment.  Everything is easy to clean, I can put parts of it in the dishwasher but it doesn\'t actually work right.  It just seems to blow cold air, the same amount of water is in it as the night before.  And the noise, even on ""Quiet"" mode is awful!  My infant somehow sleeps through it but I can\'t from hearing it over the baby monitor.  Will be buying another cool mist from another brand for sure!",1
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"We have had this product for two months in our room ,since our newborns arrival it has not helped with her sinus at all. She still wakes up congested. My husband and I realized it wasn\'t working when I got sick. This product did not help my sinus at all. Don\'t waste your money. We now are in the market for another one.",1
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"The humidifier works great.  We noticed after just two nights that our little one was waking up significantly less stuffy.  I also like that it has a ""white noise"" effect--which lulls the little one to sleep. The only down side is that the filters get gross pretty quickly.",4
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Love this humidifier, puts a cool mist out that really helps to cool off the room in the summertime.  Works really well and has a soothing white noise sound that my new baby daughter loves.",5
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,I was so excited to finally see a humidifier that all the parts can go into the dishwasher. That is the only good part. I ordered two and neither puts out the 1.5 gallons every day of water both the humidifier and the filters claim it does. I\'m lucky to get a half gallon every 36 hours out of it. I have them running full time and have replaced the filters 3 times. NOTHING WORKS. Very disappointed.,1
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"We got this humidifier to use in our infant daughter\'s room.  It is completely worthless!  First of all, it does not appear to ""humidify"" anything at all.  After running all night, the tank was still mostly full and the air in the nursery still noticably dry.  The water that HAD been used from the tank was sitting in a huge puddle behind the unit after having leaked out the back.  The water had apparently started leaking soon after turning the unit on and had sat there all night, because our hardwoods were warped.  So now we not only have to pay to replace this with a decent humidifier, we have to pay to have our floors repaired.",1
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"The packaging on the box said that it was made for the nursery.  Not so much.  I like white noise but this sounds like an airplane is taking off outside our window.  It\'s funny that they have a setting labeled quiet.  It is still louder then any other humidifier I\'ve ever owned.  It\'s big, clunky and not at all good looking for a nursery. One day later, it\'s already boxed up and ready to go back.  Save the time and don\'t bother with this one.",1
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Worst humidifier ever! It is loud, it leaks a lot, and it barely even works. Save yourself the time and buy a different humidifier.",1
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"We bought this humidifier for our newborn when he got sick the first time.  We figured, its a humidifier, aren\'t they all the same?  This humidifier has been worthless since we brought it home.  It does not produce enuogh moisture to raise the humidity in our son\'s small bedroom.  The filters are expensive and a pain.  You are supposed to let them dry completely before the next use.  I\'m sorry, but even living in CA where it\'s generally sunny all day, our filters do not dry.  I\'m having to buy a filter each time our son gets sick, sometimes two.  NOT worth the money.Recommendation:  My parents have the Vicks V4500 FilterFree which works VERY well, I notice a difference after only one night.",1
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"As other reviewers have noted, the filter sits in a shallow tray of water. Well it\'s nearly impossible to take out that tray without water spilling all over. And I\'ve had a few instances where the tank isn\'t seated exactly right and all the water leaks out. It is also quite noisy, good for white noise effects but annoying with a baby monitor since it masks the sounds of baby.",2
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"It works, and as long as you follow directions and clean it frequently, it doesn\'t get moldy. Its nice that you can put it in the dishwasher.However, the unit is very loud. That worked well for us as the white noise helped drown out household noise and let baby sleep.The worst part, and the reason  we\'ve decided to stop using it, is the filters are so expensive!  $7 each, and they last less than a month.  We finally decided to just eat the upfront cost and buy a more expensive unit that didnt eat through filters.",2
"CoCaLo Window Valance, Azania",I ordered The Baby Dinos At Play bedding set and needed a second valance.  I was disappointed when I got them hung up and the patterns do not line up. Not at all.  I clearly have 2 separate pieces instead of what I think should look like 1 solid valance.,3

Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I bought this after reading positive reviews for a cool mist humidifier that would work in our large bedroom.  From the start it has never really worked.  The filters turns to damp, soggy, smelly mush within days and, most importantly, didn\'t raise the humidity levels above 50% in our bedroom.  i am going to buy a 1 gallon humidifier for the same price and hope for a better outcome.",1
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Piece of trash! If you\'re reading reviews written just after someone bought this thing, ignore them. Sure it\'s all fine and dandy in the beginning...I have used this humidifier for 2 seasons (total of about 7 months, and have had to replace the cap and gasket 3 times. The new cap they just sent me STILL LEAKS all over the floor, rendering the entire thing useless. I give up! And on top of that, when it DID work, I had to replace the filter every 10 days or so (not every 3 months as they advertise). My friend down the street with the same humidifier has the same problem. After a week or so, it starts turning brown and smelly. And this is despite cleaning the tank and tray nearly every time, and turning the filter each time as recommended.",1
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I owned the previous version which was made by Hamilton Beach.  It lasted about 7 years and provided good service before it just got tired.  I have no problem with the filters, just run the unit dry and flip the filters.  I also use a Holmes product to fight scaling and another to fight mold.  One cap full of each per filling.  I run the unit on quiet and it just works for us.  Heat in winter with a pellet stove in a very small house and this unit is perfect.",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I\'m really disappointed with this humidifier.  It stopped working after two months (I turn it on and nothing happens).  During the short period of time that it WAS working, it did very little to elevate the humidity in a single small room.  Also, the hygrometer that is built into the humidifier is not accurate.  It showed a much higher humidity percentage than was shown on a high quality free-standing (properly calibrated) hygrometer that I also kept in the room. It is way too expensive to operate so poorly and last such a short time.  I would recommend looking elsewhere.",1
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,Not to sure that the humidity gauge is working correctly.  Living in the desert with forced air for heat it was averaging around 50% which seems high. You need to replace the filter ever so often which will add to the cost but we will see how far we can get cleaning it with vinegar rather then replacing it.,4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I hardly notice that it is on, its so quiet.  Works great!  I haven\'t had any issues with Graco before and haven\'t with this either.",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"We did some research on-line to find that this type of cool mist humidifier was essential in giving relief to an infant with breathing probblems.Before it arrived , his parents had been using a pot of hot water on the stove to create humidity in a dry electrically -heated bedroom. This product is not only very safe but effective. Within an hour the baby was breathingcomfortably and everyone was much relieved. The product also shows how much water is still available, and has differet speeds. Thanks Graco!",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"The humidifier appeared to operate acceptably for a short period, but after only a month of operating this unit, the water tank handle snapped off entirely after simply filling it in the bathtub. (The tank could not handle it\'s own filled water weight). I mounted the full tank on the humidifier body anyway (minus the sheared handle) only to come back hours later to a flooded bedroom floor. (The defective handle mount had compromised the tank when it broke, thus breaking the vacuum on the tank and rendering it useless.) Trying to find a replacement tank from Graco. So far, no luck and weeks without humidification. Very annoying.",1
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"This is an OK humidifier but has some prominent issues (or so it seems). The built-in humidistat doesn\'t seem to be a good one. It changes its readings so frequently (within seconds) that you become suspicious of its accuracy. For example, it would read 39% and, for a test drive, you turn it off and back on and the display reads 45%! Repeat it several times and it changes the reading almost every single time. So I am not sure if the built-in humidistat is of good quality and/or working correctly.The built-in filter was also total crap and went out of shape within the first few days. Luckily I\'d ordered a replacement filter with the product itself. The replacement filter is doing fine and is in use for about three weeks now.Also, the three levels of operation (QuiteMist, MED, and HI) don\'t appear to do anything except affecting the fan noise-level. You\'d expect the humidity of the room to increase slightly faster if you\'re operating it on HI but that doesn\'t happen. The humidity-engine seems to be unaffected by the various speeds -- it probably is a fan-noise leveler, not humidity-engine tuner.Overall I am not as satisfied with the product. If I didn\'t hate packaging and returning products, I\'d have returned this product. But it\'s working OK anyways though not as good as I expected. As far as recommendation goes, I\'d NOT recommend this product.",3
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I bought this humidifier to replace an old one which had a broken water tank.  I have had lots of humidifiers and this is the best one yet!!!

It is large enough to not require constant refilling and is pretty quiet considering what it does.  I run it on high during the day and turn it to medium at night.I did read all the negative reviews on the filter issues but so far, so good.  I do rinse the filter often and turn it with every refill of the tank.  We have extremely hard water and so far I have killed the heating elements on three warm mist himidifiers within a month due to scale buildup, so, for me anyway, replacing a filter is going to be less expensive.  I also bought a replacement filter when I purchased the unit, and will stock up on them at the end of the season sales at my local big box store.If you need more moisture than the little bedside units, this big boy will do the trick!!",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Vegas is a very dry place. I bought this humidifier in hopes of getting a better nights sleep. The unit is very easy to put together and the interface is very user-friendly. I only use the humidifier at night and I leave it at 60% humidity. I end up using about a half gallon of distilled water a night. I do wake up feeling better but after reading the manual, I feel like the machine is using more water than it should.",4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"We had a Hamilton Beach model which was essentially the same as this which lasted us ten years. Having the humidistat controller made this all the better a replacement. We\'ve order three of them now. Very quiet and according to my weather station, which has a very accurate humidity monitor, they are keeping are house at 45%. Best bang for the buck we\'ve found.",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"We had two of this same model (Hamilton Beach) for many years are were very pleased with them. We switched to these because of the built-in humidistat. Very quiet and keeps the humidity levels fairly precise. If you want 45% humidity in the room, set the unit to 50%, as the humidistat is close to the filter area.",4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Ran the Graco for the first time, went to fill the tank and since it was too large to use the sink faucet, put it under the tub faucet. It slipped, dropped a few inches into the tub and shattered. Very thin plastic, never had this problem with my old Holmes. Now that I\'ve read all the bad reviews about the filter and I put in an Amex claim so I might get my money back on this one, I\'m thinking to go for a more expensive one without a filter. This one is highly rated in all the consumer sites and none mention the stinky filter problem, but I do believe all the reviewers on this site!",2
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Selected this item as a alternative to the Hamilton Beach TrueAir humidifier.  In comparison, this one is quite loud - even on the lowest setting.",3
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Live in a single wide, no way it does more than one room.  on high.  It does our living room, the humi- state does not work right as was stated in another review. It reads high.  I was looking to take care of my entire home to help the allergy sufferers.  Its loudness does not bother me and it is near my tv, and I have sever to moderate hearing loss, WAIT... background noise usually kills me when Im wathing TV, but this did not I hear my program just fine.  Im not impressed with the humidity in the air thus far in my living room which is open to the kitchen.  Ill probably return it once it runs this last water through.  Like others said , it puts out the max gallons per day, after being filled appropriatly 2 time.  I will not buy another entire home humidifier, I read reviews on the bigger ones and give up, Ill put smaller ones in every room.",2
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I love this humidifier- with the humidistat it only runs when needed.  The quiet setting really is quiet- I use this setting when DS is sleeping.  It\'s also very easy to fill.  Depending on the humidity, the water can last a few days or even up to a week.My only complaint- there\'s no indication when it runs out of water.  I just happen to notice it keeps running and the humidity level stays low.  Kind of annoying- which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.Besides that one complaint I\'m very happy with it and may purchase one for our own bedroom.",4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I like it. It succeeded in preventing my large bedroom from getting dry and damaging my skin and sleep this winter! This was the purpose and it served this purpose well.Over the years I have tried many humidifiers and while this is not the most powerful, but, it is also simple and easy to use and so far works very well. It doesn\'t leave dampness on the floor and I love the Humidity % rating. I am not sure how sophisticated the humity measurement is, but I do feel it when the % is low and then after awhile when it is less dry in the room.I think it is good for a medium to large room - maybe up to  300-400 Sq Ft.",4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"My husband and I tried a larger, higher-output unit, which we returned after 30 minutes of use. It undoubtedly would have humidified our small house, but it roared like a 747 taking off. We ordered the Graco humidifer as a replacement, even though we were skeptical that a medium-size unit would do the job. We were pleasantly surprised. Not only does it keep our ranch home at 50% humidity during the dry windy winters of Indiana, but it\'s whisper-quiet while doing it. To top it all off, it costs less the most units with similar capacities. So far there have no leaks and no odors. Usually my lips would be chapped and my husband\'s fingers would be cracked and bleeding by January. So far, we\'re completely comfortable. Buy this humidifier.",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"We\'ve owned this for about 6 months and run it either 24-hours or 12-hours a day, depending on what we\'re doing.  Here in Arizona it\'s pretty dry all the time but keeping it running keeps the whole house in good shape.  We have pretty hard water and have to replace the filters about every 3-4 months. I\'ve never had a problem with it leaking or smelling like anything but pure water.  People who are having mildew or oder problems probably need to do soemthing to their water, like maybe add a few drops of bleach to the tank when they fill up.  It\'s certainly not the humidifier\'s fault. I\'d buy it again.UPDATE 12/22/09:The humidifier stopped working today.  Since I\'m handy with electronics I took it apart and determined that the fan is what died.  It has been running basically non-stop, 24/7 for the last year and a half, on the lowest speed.  I\'m torn as to weather I\'m unhappy about this because we did run it much longer than it was probably designed for, while on the other hand it shouldn\'t take much to design a fan that could run basically forever.",3
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,The generates the required humidity in our newborn bedroom. Hence it does what it\'s supposed to do and is easy to re-fill.,5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I purchased this humidifier because of its capacity and price.  So far it does the job well.  If only it would shut down the fan and display a red light once the water is gone then I would rate it 5 stars.  Otherwise, its excellent.",4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Graco true air 4 gallons humidifier is definately a good product. I have never owned any humidifiers before but reading other reviews I decided to get this one and I am satisfied.Humidifer has 3 operation speeds: ultra quiet, medium and high. Humidity level goes up the fastest while operating at the highest level but it is also very loud. What I found useful for myself and my wife is turning humidifier at the high level until it reaches 40% and lowering to ultra quiet position. This way we do not hear it so bad while sleeping. We only use this humidifier at night while we and our baby sleeps.Usually we have to refill it every other day with water so there is no problem with it.overall it is very nice unit for one medium size room. it reaches 40% humidity (from about 25%) within several minutes at the highest level.hope you will find this review helpful",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"I purchased this item a few weeks back based on all the great reviews.  After receiving it and using it in our 220 sq ft bedroom I contacted Graco because it would not raise the humidity past 42% although it was set at 50% (which is the recommended setting).  I sent it back and received a new one.  The new one did the exact same thing.  After trying it in various rooms I found that it would work well in small rooms (10 x 12 types) but nothing much bigger, even though it\'s rated for 1200 sq ft.  The company has given me great customer service overall and has agreed to refund the money I paid for it.  Another point I should make is that the filter wears out quickly creating more cost.  I only used the first unit for about a week and the filter was looking pretty rough.  After researching this I found that other people complained about the same thing.",1
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,I bought one of these before and liked it so much I bought a second.  One for each room that I use the most,5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,This is an excellent Humidifier especially when considering the price. It really pumps out the water into the room air. I have a 1250 square foot apartment with hot air heat and this Humdifier keeps the humidity to at least 20 percent. There is only one negative about this device and that is the amount of torque required to seal and unseal the water compartment. It is considerable and probably beyond the ability of an elderly person. The Waco company should have provided a separate leverage arm to fit into the cap of the water compartment. It would have been nice for the water compartment to have been made of transparent material in order to note when refilling is required. It is important to ignore the humidity number displayed on the Humidifier. It is meaningless. One should buy a separate humidistat and place it well away from the Humidifier in order to get a realistic reading of room humidity.,5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Worked fine for a couple months, then something failed in the reservoir plug, which caused it to leak all over my wood floor. Flawed design, you shouldn\'t have to worry about a flood from correct use of a humidifier.",1
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Not a complaint. It works flawlessly and is seldom off.Wonderful if you reside in a dry climate, like New Mexico.",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,I like this humidifier very much.  It is much easier to clean and fill than the old Holmes tower humidifier that it replaces.The water tank appears to be of a less brittle plastic material.  My old one cracked easily and eventually fatally.Also I like that it doesn\'t cycle on and off constantly like the Holmes did while on automatic.  The only reason I didn\'t give it five stars is that I can\'t find Graco filters locally.  I bought another brand from Walmart that I haven\'t had to use yet so not sure if they will fit.  One thing I discovered with my old humidifier is to use the filtered water from the refrigerator.  I fill a pitcher to pour into the tank.  The filters last much longer that way.,4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"About 6 month ago our then 14 month old son had a very bad cold which resulted in breathing problems at night time. Our doctor recommended the purchase of a cool mist humidifier for his room to make breathing easier for him. We did some research on the internet and continuously stumbled across the Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier. It had pretty good overall ratings and was in an affordable price range so we went ahead and gave it a try.So far we haven\'t had any problems with our unit. It is super easy to use, has a large tank for your convenience, is quiet and doesn not (unlike some cheaper models) leave a water puddle on the carpet within 4 feet of the humidifier.I am glad we made that purchase however those filters do go bad rather quickly and replacements are on the pricey side. This might not be the solution for someone on a tight budget!",4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Love this and we have two.  yes, you have to buy filters, but its quiet and you can set the level you want.  Its not whisper quiet.  It has a slight hum and serves as some white noise.  Great for maintaining a level desired. Couple this with the pro-tec cleaning cartridges to decrease the frequency of cleaning.  Prevents the slimy build-up.  If you are looking for something to run when child is sick this isn\'t the best product.  For those occasions I use one of those that are shaped like an animal.  We have the cow.",5
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,I have had my Graco humidifier for three winters now.  I like not having to constantly refill the tank.  It also does a great job and is quite quiet.  I just bought a second one for another bedroom.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I had to send this one back.  It worked one night and then the motor stopped.  Kudos to Amazon for their great service in replacing it.,4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Does its job. Not as quiet as I would have liked, but I wouldn\'t say it\'s loud either. I use it in my bedroom at night and it doesn\'t keep me from falling asleep. I particularly like the LED display and its intuitive design.",4
"Graco Meal Time Highchair, Betsey","I am a mother of two girls, a 4 yr old and a 3 yr old. I bought this high chair for my sister, who will be a first-time mother. Since she is due soon I assembled it for her, which was very easy. From my experience I love the setup it looks like it will work very well, it reclines and the seat height adjust. I love the fabric and how it is water repellant, it looks like it should be so easy to clean.",5
"Graco Meal Time Highchair, Betsey","Its a cute highchair, but a bit compact. Its also very hard to find the toys to fit on it.",5
"Graco Meal Time Highchair, Betsey",My husband and i purchased this high chair to match the other pieces we bought.  The price was awesome and we received this item in 5 days. We liked that you could just wipe it off to clean it. It\'s not cloth if that\'s what you were thinking.  We not only purchased this item we also purchased the car seat and the swing.  Other members of the family purchased the stroller and the pack n play.  I would highly recommend this product.,5
"Graco Meal Time Highchair, Betsey",THIS WAS ACTUALLY BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER THAT LIVES WITH US. IT IS A VERY CUTE HIGHCHAIR.  IT TAKES UP SOME SPACE WHEN SET UP BUT OTHERWISE WE LIKE IT ALOT...,4
"Graco DuoGlider Stroller, Tango in the Tongo","We got this for our newborn and 2 year old, works great and they both like it.  We like how the back seat lays flat and the front seat sits up straight.  It is big to lug around though.",4
"Graco DuoGlider Stroller, Tango in the Tongo","This double stroller is easy to fold up and open. sturdy enough for older children.  Plenty of cargo space.  Easily washable and practical.  I like the handle release to fold up the unit. great for twins, but the front seat is a bit small.",4
"Graco DuoGlider Stroller, Tango in the Tongo","I\'m still shopping for a double-stroller and had high hopes for this model.  I found it in a store and asked an employee to help make sure that it would fit in my trunk before purchasing it.  Unfortunately, this stroller was too big for the rather roomy trunk in my new Nissan Altima.  Hoping that maybe the Quattro Tour, which is supposedly 20% smaller when folded will fit, otherwise it may be time to trade in the car for the mommy-van.  I can\'t really speak to the other features of the stroller, but just wanted to share that it does not fit in the trunk of an Altima.",2
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"Not dependable.  We are probably on our fifth one that we\'ve returned and replaced.  We\'ve only kept getting it as we were stuck with it from a registry and didn\'t want to fork out more money for a different one. Our issues: lots of static, constantly flaking out between the red warning light (off) and being on, one parent monitor went completely dead although it ""looked"" ok with the green light, and overall, just sporadic use.  Many evenings we\'d sit and turn it on and off every few minutes just to make sure the baby was ok, otherwise if left on long term, it would beep with the red light which meant it wasn\'t working.On the good side, it does have a long range.Overall, don\'t buy unless you want a unit that you\'ll have to return or one that will flake out on you within a couple months.",1
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"After doing my research and reading reviews online I decided to give this monitor a try. Two of my neighbors have the non vibrating ones, one of them loves it the other one said it was ok.I let the monitor charge for over 24 hours. Then I took one of the parent units downstairs with me to check it out. The reception was perfectly clear and I could hear every sound my baby made with no interfering noises. The battery lasted several hours, all was well.When the battery died, I tried to use the other parent unit, which after being charged for over 24 hours did not have any charge. So I let the previously working unit charge again and it did not work. At his point both of my parent units were not holding any charge. So I took the base with me to see if it would work on the base while it was charging. It didn\'t. It kept beeping and the red light kept coming on.I am very disappointed, I am taking it back to the store. The clarity of reception was amazing but very short lived.",2
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"This monitor works somedays and doesn\'t on others.  It is highly unreliable.  Our bedroom is directly across the hall and it loses frequencey often.  It beeps constantly and either from loss of frequency or the battery dieing.  It doesn\'t work outside or inside reliably. It surely doesn\'t work up to 2000 ft. As well, the lights are bright and keep you awake.  I can\'t say anything beneficial about this monitor, it is horrible!",1
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"It doesn\'t last long.  After a while it continously beeps even after trying various times of charging and not charging.  It got to the point where it didn\'t let us sleep.  At first I thought we may have gotten a faulty one, so I got another i monitor and that one lasted even less time than the first one.  So, my advice is do not waste your money on this montior or you\'ll never get sleep with the beeping!",1
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"I\'m glad Amazon allows you to revise your review. I HATE THIS BABY MONITOR! I WANT TO SMASH IT!!! DO NOT BUY THIS! I am sitting in my living room right now, everyone is sleeping, nothing happening in my house at all and the monitor starts beeping because it has lost it\'s connection with the base. No reason for this yet it happens ALL THE TIME! Graco, this product is awful!!!!",1
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"I got this monitor 2 years ago and it worked for a year and half. it worked great!! but by my second child, the batteries are shot, i can\'t take it more than 20 feet outside, it beeps all the time as if it were out of range, the static is awful from time to time, it loses connection each time i use my phone, and it pretty much just drives me nuts. BUT, on the upside, it is VERY VERY durable! one day it was driving me particularly insane by just beeping away regardless of where i put it downstairs. So in an admittedly immature fit of rage, i chucked it as hard as i could down the basement stairs and onto the concrete floor. now i may not be a softball pitcher, but i have a good arm on me! it flew into pieces. come to find later as i went down to do laundry, it had ""broken"" without actually breaking! it had just popped apart!! and lo and behold, i put it back together and it works JUST as crappily as it did before!!! but certainly no worse and not a doggone crack on it!!",2
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"We\'ve had this monitor for 19 months now, and it has worked perfectly every day.  I think the people who gave it a poor review are not using the monitor correctly.  Obviously, if there were as many problems with the monitor as some of the reviews say, then this product would not be on the market.  The problem is the user, not the product.  There are very specific instructions for setting the channel when you first use the unit, and if you don\'t set it right and follow the instructions in the right order, you will never get a clear connection and the monitor will never function properly.Our house is two story, and fairly large, with a wireless network and multiple computers - we have never had problems with static, or with losing connection.  The rare occasion that it has suddenly lost connection, just turn the unit off and then on again and it will receive the signal again.  The charge has never died (it isn\'t meant to be off the base for hours at a time).  We just leave it on the base or plugged in to charge all the time; it sits on the nightstand upstairs and kitchen counter downstairs.  I have taken it outside with me several times, clipped to my pocket, while I rake leaves, or do other yard work.  It has never lost signal.The monitor is very sensitive too, so at night, I turn it to the lowest setting because I only need to hear if my son is totally awake, and not every little movement and sigh.  During naps, I turn it up louder so I can hear him over the regular house noise.  I don\'t use the vibe feature, I don\'t find it necessary.Overall, this monitor has been great for us, and we are ordering a second one for the new baby that is due any day now.  I gave it 4 stars because I do think it is a bit overpriced for a simple baby monitor.",4
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"This is the first review I\'ve ever written...the product is so bad that I was compelled to write.  The parent monitoring unit keeps losing it\'s signal, and it beeps a loud noise when this happens.  I read the manual, which explains that this can happen occasionally, but it happens so much -- and only one room away -- that the monitor is useless to us.  I\'m currently searching online for a replacement.  I can\'t speak to interference issues, because this monitor NEVER worked for us.  I got maybe an hour out of it once before it started to go haywire on us.",1
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"We have tried monitor after monitor for our boys: every audio-only type of monitor you can think of, two different video monitors, and also two very expensive wireless web cameras.  None was reliable, and nearly all of them made terrible static noise such that they kept my husband and me up at night.  I did research, and this monitor came highly recommended by Consumer Reports, which is a source that has never failed me.  And sure enough, this monitor is great!  We have a complex home wireless computer network, wireless web cams, cordless phones, cell phones... and this monitor is so clear and static-free that sometimes I worry that it\'s turned off!  (It isn\'t.)  Not only is it really clear, but it picks up every peep my 17-month-old makes.  If we don\'t have any other noises around us, we can even hear him breathing sometimes, and the room component is a good 5 feet from his crib.  Very, very happy with this monitor!",5
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"I am really shocked to see so many negative review of these.  We have been using them for nearly two years and think they are really great.  I suspect the difference is that we rarely take them out of the charging cradle, so battery life is not as much of an issue.  That said, we have never had an issue with the battery running out when we spend time in the backyard or whatnot.The mic is very sensitive and picks up every sound in the room - which is great.  The vibrate feature can be set to vibrate at variable levels.We have found the range in our single family home to be perfectly adequate to cover our entire half acre property.Rarely there is some clicking, but only when at the edge of the range.  There is even an out of range tone and light.I deducted one star because joining new units to the system is a major PITA.  We have three monitors spread throughout the house.",4
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"I have to add to the poor rating of this product.  I bought mine at Target, but it\'s so awful I want to shout it from the mountain tops.It worked as a wireless monitor for about 1 month.  Our property is 60 feet by 50 feet.  I was in the back yard, 20 feet away from babys room and it wouldn\'t work.  I had dreams of gardening with the baby monitor clipped to my belt... NOPE!It works most of the time plugged in and only in the room directly below baby\'s room.  Only most of the time (80%), sometimes we are just baby monitor-less.  Can\'t figure out if it\'s rainy days or sunny days or days that end in Y.Terrible, terrible product.",1
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"This monitor has driven me insane since my daughter\'s birth 8 months ago, and I am finally caving and buying a new one.  My main issues have been battery life (the rechargable batteries in the ""portable"" handsets last ten minutes MAX so must always stay in their chargers), and the cord on the back of the nursery unit constatly comes loose, which results in, at best, irritating static or sometimes, the loss of signal between the receivers and the nursery unit.",1
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"I don\'t usually review things, but I felt like I needed to review this one because after I got it for a shower gift I was really worried about all the negative reviews that I have seen about this monitor.  It has been great for us!  Good battery life, no blinking red lights, good sound, small enough to fit in your pocket, never looses reception.  My son is 5 months old and we have used it every day of his life and never had one problem (knock on wood, knock on wood). We like that the base can be put anywhere and runs off of batteries if you need it too.  (Really convenient when we lay him in the pack and play in the living room and we want to go outside for yard work).  The vibration is a good option if you\'re doing something that you would not be able to hear the monitor, like mowing the lawn or something. We don\'t use it for anything else.  We usually keep the monitors on their bases, because if you turn them up, you can hear them from a couple rooms away.  There is really no need to wear these things unless you\'re outside or you live in a really big house.  So, maybe that\'s why we haven\'t run into any battery issues.UPDATE: He\'s 13 months old...and it\'s still going strong! :-)",5
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,I tried several monitors before finding this one and none were as clear. This one works perfectly even in our 3 story home. We also have wireless internet which does not seem to affect it at all. The battery life is long and the connection is clear. These are great!,5
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"I\'ve had this monitor for several months now. At first I wasn\'t too sure how well it would work, but now I\'m very happy with it.  It\'s easy to keep the receiver in the cradle while it\'s charging, and then pick it up to take with me to another part of our home.  The vibrator is handy if you don\'t want to make noise or if you\'re listening to your mp3.  You do have to turn off the receiver if you turn off the main unit because the receiver will beep until it \'finds\' the signal.  I gave it 4 stars because sometimes there is static, though that may be because we live in an apartment.",4
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"We started using this monitor with our first child. It worked well for about the first year, but know drives us crazy (our son is now 16 mos old). It hardly holds a battery charge, at the most up to an hour. It is constantly losing signal for no apparent reason, no matter which channel we use. Also, it will be working fine for a bit and then turn to static for a period of time or until we get fed up and turn it off. We are due with our second baby in May and are going to have to purchase another monitor system. It is so sad and frustrating that this product is so unreliable.",2
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"Graco imonitor Vibe. This monitor is highly unreliable. It loses frequencey often and the battery life is poor.

Graco Humidifier Replacement Filter for 4.0 Gallon,"I buy these filters all the time. My son needs the humidifier, and we have had good success with it. The filters start to get expensive month to month, because their lifespan is short, and dragging that span any longer could become a health risk. With that said, I bought the product, and like it so I do need the filters. Someone should make a washable/reusable filter for this unit. Aside from that, Amazon should offer a quantity discount, that would help those who really need the filters on a regular basis, to lower some expenses. 3 out of 5 stars because they work. If they were $2-$3 a piece which is what they should be, they\'d be a 5.",3
Graco Humidifier Replacement Filter for 4.0 Gallon,"This Graco humidifier is really great!  It has a nice feature where it shuts off the fan when the desired humidity level is reached, then comes back on when it senses it went down.

This humidifier is a new product for them and the filters were not to be found anywhere. Happily this should be straightened out by June 2009 or before.  I finally found them on Amazon and ordered two.  If I wanted the filters I had to pay the exhorbitant price of nearly $20 for shipping!

"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila","The first time my 3 year old daughter rode in this seat, her first booster experience, she pulled her arm out from under the shoulder belt and was crawling out of the seat as we went down the road. The belt was locked and snug across her, but it was her first time without a five point harness, and she was thrilled to be able to get out of this one!!!! Needless to say we threatened (nicely) to put her back in her ""baby"" seat if she didn\'t wear her seatbelt correctly, and she\'s pretty much been doing fine ever since. That first taste of freedom, though...No problems with the shipping, quality, or anything else, and the seat itself is adorable. Just watch those squirmy kids the first few times they\'re in it.",4
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila","My 3 1/2 year old daughter wanted a ""pink, big girl car seat"" for Christmas and after much searching I found this precious pattern.  We had it sitting by the Christmas tree on Christmas morning and she was the happiest little girl around!  It is PERFECT for her!",5
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila",I am pleased with this car seat except for 1 issue...The arm rests do not go high enough for older children. They have two settings and even on the highest setting the seat belt is hard to get under the armrest and over my daughters legs. Other than that it is easy to take the back rest off and adjustable for head height.,4
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila",This seat is exactly what my daughter wanted.  It has a removable back so you can use it whichever way you choose.  The fabric seems to be holding up nicely; though it has not had a washing yet.  All in all it is great!,5
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila","My daughter or my son-in-law consistently forgot to leave the booster seat they use in their cars.  So, I purchased this and it works.  It installed easily into a 2004 Camry in the center postion of the back seat which has a shoulder strap.  It needs a shoulder strap. The cover is not as luxurious as the more expensive car seats but because I will be using it only occasionally, I think it will last years for us. I can now drive my granddaughter to the park so I am happy with it.",4
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila","The carseat is very cute and my daughter loves it, but it does not seem safe.  It doesn\'t fit securly to the chair nor does the seatbeat seem to secure her over the carseat.  It needs to be able to lock the belt.",3
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila","We love the pattern.  The seat is comfortable & my daughter enjoys riding in it.  Easy to transfer from car to car.  Lightweight.  Cup holders work the best of any car seat we\'ve had so far.  Does not recline much, so her head droops when she sleeps (hope to fix this with a pillow.)",5
Graco imonitor Video 2.0 Version,"This device was a significant disappointment. It seems to spend too much time ""searching"" for a signal and its time delay and poor visuals make this an impractical option. Additionally, the signal strength is so weak it cuts out more than a few yards from the base. It is our second Graco monitor unit (we traded in the first because we thought it was defective). Customer service was very courteous and efficient however.",1
Graco imonitor Video 2.0 Version,We bought this baby monitor and it is a huge disappointment.  The video image is very fuzzy and constantly disappears while the unit appears to search for the image again.  When that happens (every few seconds) you lose both the video and the sound so you have no monior at all.  Also the sound is very VERY quiet so even at the highest volume setting IF the unit is working you will never wake up unless you have the parent part strapped to your ear. Don\'t waste your money on this one!,1
Graco imonitor Video 2.0 Version,"We bought this monitor because it was digital and wouldn\'t interfere with other monitors in our neighborhood.  We\'ve had it for 2.5 yrs and have had to reset it maybe once a month.  The picture quality isn\'t the best either.  We used it for our toddler, who doesn\'t need much monitoring, and it was good enough for us but I wouldn\'t recommend this for a newborn.  After 2.5yrs, we couldn\'t keep the handheld monitor charged because the connection is loose.  It\'s pretty much useless to us now.  This was our 4th monitor so it wasn\'t the worse but certainly wasn\'t the best...especially with the expensive price tag.",1
"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet, Betsey","I purchased this as a gift for my cousin and she loves it!  The colors and design is even prettier in person.  At the moment, she uses the bassinet since the baby is only two weeks old.  She loves that there\'s a changing table attached to it.  It was easy to assemble and it definitely worth the price.",5
"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet, Betsey","I got this for my daughter who is having her fifth child, so she knows what she likes.  She thought this was great.  Not only for a basinet by the bed for the first months, but also as a travel bed for camping.  Their family loves to camp and this new little one will fit right in -- in her own take-a-long bed.",5
Giraffe Towel Doll,"The giraffe was great and my son loved it, except that it bled when I washed it in cold water.  Now the face and the inside fabric are pink.  It says it is washable...  For the price paid, I didn\'t expect it to bleed.",3
Baby Shower Cor-sockage Corsage Gift (Blue),"I purchased this for my daughter to wear at her baby shower. It was beautiful! Everyone raved about it. It did not come with a safety pin and we spent a few minutes trying to find one so we could pin it on her, but overall was very pleased with it!",4
Rich Frog Squeak Easy Elephant,"This is such a cute toy, but it doesn\'t really do much other than serve as a possible \'lovey\'. The squeak is there, but it isn\'t a very big squeak though it is cute when your little one manages to squeak it hard enough that it surprises them. This is the kind of toy that if your kid really takes to it, you will love it. It is easy to transport and wash and fits easily in a baby\'s hand. But, if they could care less, it just becomes another cute toy that serves no purpose. I would recommend trying to find this in person to see if it is a toy your baby responds to; there are several cute characters to choose from. My girlfriend\'s daughter LOVED her frog and carried it almost everywhere. Our son played with it for about 5 minutes of his life.",3
Rich Frog Squeak Easy Elephant,"This was the first toy that my daughter could make squeak on her own and she loved it! It\'s durable, pleasing, and fun. I recommend this so very, very highly.",5

"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","it\'s a fairly small plush rattle, i didnt realize it was so small, approx 4 inches -- but perfect for a crib.  love it.  giving to my infant Godson with the silver tube to hold his certificate",5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",I got this for my nephew. It\'s adorable and I have no complaints about the purchase.  Inexpensive and of good quality.,5

"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","This is just so cute in person, just what I was looking for a gift for a baptism present. Thanks-",5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",I purchased and had this shipped to my Mother the day last July when I learned of her massive stroke; she has not let it out of her sight since the day she got it and it is a great source of comfort to her.,5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",This worked well for my nephews baptism. My nephew and I liked that it made noise. I wish it was a little bit bigger.,4
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","Soft, very small. Perfect little gift for a baby dedication. It is has a soft rattle. The baby really enjoyed it and the parents loved it.",5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",These were sturdy and with a quiet rattle. I liked the fact that it was small and easy for the baby to hold on to. Very affordable.,5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",This is exactly what I needed for our grandson\'s blessing.  It is soft and will keep him entertained during the blessing it is also a great keep sake.,5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",I didn\'t expect this adorable lamb to be so tiny. Yes the measurements are always listed on all items but I didn\'t read them with this item. I went with the photo which appears to be alot bigger. It still is very cute and rattles. It\'s perfect for a small baby and will be given to my friends daughter at her christening.,4
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","I was searching for a special christening gift for our godchild...something out of the ordinary which she could enjoy.  This little plush rattle is adorable!  The embroidered cross on its heart is a great reminder of our godchild\'s new life in Christ, and of course the lamb is a symbol of innocence, purity, the ""Lamb of God"" in whom she is baptized!  It\'s a little smaller than I expected, but then again, it\'s a perfect size for a little one to grasp.  Nice, inexpensive, token-type gift...I\'m also very pleased with my purchase experience from Amazon.",4
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",Very cute little plush toy/rattle. I purchased this for a gift and have no regrets. I would recommend this item.,5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb",I liked this baby rattle for my nephew because it is safe.  No button eyes or other attachments that a baby could remove and swallow.  Very soft and baby friendly.,5
Mary Meyer Christening Lamb Blanket - 14 Inches,"The lamb was exactly as pictured and arrived on time; it looks to be good quality.  I paid extra for the gift wrap, a cheap-looking dark blue cardboard box with a broad gold ribbon and thin, super sticky note card that tore off the surface of the box when I removed it to check out the gift inside.  I ordered 3 gift-wrapped items the same week; in each case the effect was cheap and inappropriate and each item had to be rewrapped (the printer i ordered as a gift was  loosely set in a sloppy big blue paper/fabric bag that no one could find a suitable use for).  If I could, I would keep the items, but return the gift wrap for refund!",4
Mary Meyer Christening Lamb Blanket - 14 Inches,"My daughter got this as a Baptism gift and has called it lamby since then.  This is ""lamby"" number 2 because we seemed to have lost her first one.  Its very cute and a great gift.",5
Mary Meyer Christening Lamb Blanket - 14 Inches,IT WAS  ALL I HOPED IT WOULD BE AND I CAN\'T WAIT TO GIVE IT TO MY GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER  FOR CHRISTMAS.  THANK YOU,5

Mary Meyer Christening Lamb Blanket - 14 Inches,"I am very happy with this purchase, it was cute and made a very nice addition to a gift basket.",4
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy",I absolutely love this travel chair.  I always use it in the shopping cart whenever I go shopping.  My daughter is 6 months old and starting to outgrow her carseat so we bought her a convertible carseat.  The major drawback with this is that I can no longer put the carseat on the cart when I shop and she\'s not quite old enough to sit in the cart without falling over.  This travel seat makes it possible to shop easy again.  My daughter feels like a big girl sitting up and being able to look around and has so much more fun than when she is in her car seat.  This is a great idea.  I love it.,5
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","This is very useful to carry around. however, if you have an overactive and experimenting child who figures out how to take away the shoulder straps and hang half his/her body out of the chair, you need to be cautious when using it. And it\'s defly. not meant for leaving the child alone  in it.",4
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","Got this to make our vacation with a 7 month old a little easier. The bottom is supposedly slide resistant, but this isn\'t the case. My baby\'s butt would slide forward on the chair, so his neck and head ended up squished against the back of the chair. Both straps were super tight too.  Needless to say, it didn\'t get much use.",2
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","We needed a baby seat that we can travel with, this is very good. This product works quite well to secure our seven month old baby in a regular baby seat in the restaurant. One small complaint is that there are four straps to hold the baby in place, the two shoulder straps could design a bit better because it can fall off the baby\'s shoulder easily. But one can easily fix this by stitching or safety pinned the two straps together (in the back), so the two strips don\'t separate until it is near the neck in the back, this way, the shoulder straps will stay in place and baby secures in the sit.  It packs up easy and it is quite small and weight very little.",5
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy",I use this to strap my daughter to me on the plane as a lap child. You can use it for take off or landing.,5
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy",I ordered this when traveling with my 6 month old baby hoping to use it as a highchair option.  It works well if your baby likes to sit up on their own.  Mine didn\'t at that time and she kept listing to the side so I had to have someone help hold her up while being fed.Pros: inexpensive and reasonably easy to use.  Folds up nicely for travel.Cons: slip proof bottom OK but not great so definately don\'t walk away! As mentioned above even if your baby can sit up but doesn\'t want to they can list to the side as side clasps do not hold them upright.Would rec. and plan to use as she gets bigger.,4
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","I bought this because of all the great reviews and how good it looks. I do not know why it works for so many other babies but mine! Granted that the product is easy to pack, store & clean. It did not take much work to set up neither. It would be a really cool product if it worked for us. My 7 months old baby kept sliding off the chair no matter how tight I used the straps. Also, the back straps did not stay put in one position but kept sliding down making my poor baby slumping badly & slide forward even more! Shoulder straps did not stay on neither (my baby is 7 months old & weights 17lbs).I like how small it is to travel with, so I\'m thinking of adding a layer of non slid drawer liner onto the bottom (which supposed to be non slid aready) hoping it would help.",2
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","Can\'t tell you how many people ask me about this chair. It is the coolest thing! Has saved me I don\'t know how many times. The best baby buy yet!!! I never have to worry about what to do with him!!!Keeps my son in the grocery cart. That\'s nice. When we go to a restuarant, no need to use icky high chair with broken straps (my son is very thin, he would fall right out). Strap him into the chair and he eats like a pro. Fussy on the plane? Strap him in and let him sleep on your lap.Folds into nothing, I keep it in the diaper bag. People are amazed by the chair and how small it folds down. Others with thin babies complained of it falling off their shoulders. No offense - NOTHING stays on my son\'s shoulders. We have a little clip we use to clip together the shoulder straps, like what most car seats have, and it works great. You can get them anywhere.",5
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","I love this harness.  We have an old fashioned wooden high chair and needed a safety harness so baby wouldn\'t slip.  I looked everywhere online and this is the best harness I found.  It is perfect and stays put and keeps my baby safe.  The shoulder straps aren\'t perfect and can move around, but the waist belt gets the job done.  Baby fits snuggly and safely in and isn\'t going anywhere.  I imagine this is good for traveling to restaurants, etc as well.  Maybe in a store grocery cart as well.",4
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","This seat should work, provided that your baby is not a squirmer and is wider at the shoulders or chubbier. The chair used should be heavy. Also if the chair back is narrower on the bottom than the top (and your kid wriggles), it causes the top seat strap to fall lower, leaving your kid in an awkward schlump. Our vigorous wiggler nearly toppled the chair, travel seat and all, weighing only 15lbs. Because our babe was too narrow, the shoulder straps kept sliding off. I did like that the seat was designed to fold up into itself with the attached carry case, so no losing small parts. I returned this item.See my review of the BambinOz Porta Chair which I thought worked better.",3
"Snazzy Baby My Baby\'s Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","The Snazzy Baby is great when you are in a jam for a high chair.  I first started using it when E was 6 1/2 months old and it wasn\'t too great, but as she has gotten that little bit bigger 7 1/2 months it is working even better.  We used it just today in a cafe and she sat really well in her chair and I felt confident that she wasn\'t going anywhere.  I had thought I might use this at home instead of a bulky high chair, but definitely need a proper high chair.  It folds very neatly into its own pouch, cleans easily and weighs nothing.",4

CTM&reg; Infants Elastic Clip-End 1 Inch Solid Suspenders,use it for my three month old - adorable! i like how it expands so it can grow with him,4
CTM&reg; Infants Elastic Clip-End 1 Inch Solid Suspenders,"Okay.  Not super strong, but adequate for occasional use.  Best for church or party use, not sturdy enough for play purposes.",3

CTM&reg; Infants Elastic Clip-End 1 Inch Solid Suspenders,I bought these for my son to complete his Gnome Halloween costume. They worked great! Also we used them after to help keep his pants up because he had such a small waist that his pants were too big. Would definitely recommend to anyone!,5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","I like the seat cover, both the print and the touch of fabric, but it doesn\'t seem to breathe well in hot summer day. I rarely give 5 stars, so go figure...",4
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","Well-built, good looking, Britax car seats are high quality, durable and comfy.  And baby seems to like it a lot!",5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","We started off with the Graco Snugfit and my son surpassed the weight limit by the time he was 5 months, yes he\'s a big boy. I wish we would have just started off with this car seat. My son is comfortable and loves the cow print.",5

"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","This carseat is comfortable, durable and suprisingly light.  It is easy to switch from car to car which I have to do everyday.  I have gotten many compliments on how cute it is too! I would recommend this carseat to anybody.",5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Jessica",The picture does not do this car sear justice! Absolutely beautiful and incredibly fast shipping!!!! My daughter loves this car seat!!!,5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Jessica",This chair is wonderful and the shipping was quick.  I was happy on both counts.  I\'d buy from this seller again.  The pattern is beautiful and my daughter is quite comfortable in it!,5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Jessica","I went for this seat after I found the cheaper, slightly higher rated one at Consumer Reports to be out of production (boy did that company blow it).The seat is great, easy to install and very well built.  The biggest suprise to me was that it was made in the USA (I didn\'t think we could buy any manufactured consumer item that wasn\'t made in Communist China these days).  My daughter loves the seat and adores the pink and flowers on it.  Everything is easy to adjust, the cover comes right off for easy cleaning, changing belt should height adjustments was a piece of cake.A great seat, great ratings at CS and you\'re actually helping workers in the US by buying it.",5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Jessica","I love this car seat! It has a pretty seat cover that you can change which means I can use it for my next child, even if its a boy. I also love that it has velcro on the seat belt so it holds the belts open to easily put my little girl in. Very easy to adjust seat belts and to switch from car to car since we only have one seat. It\'s definately worth a little extra cash! Plus, who can argue with the safest seat available!?!",5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Jessica",Great car seat.  Only issue we have with it is the child can loosen the chest part.  I wish someone could invent a part that does not slide easily.  But all in all it\'s a VERY nice car seat.  I highly recommend it!,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My daughter loved this bouncer until she grew and I had to adjust it--I carefully followed the written instructions and the bouncer would not stay adjusted; after I adjusted it and put her back in the bouncer, the strap went right through the buckle and her knees were practically on the floor. I\'ve tried about a dozen times to adjust it, following the product instructions very carefully, and it doesn\'t work.",2
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,We are so happy that we returned the one we initially bought at Babies R Us.  This one actually bounces.  Our son loves it and it is pure fun for the whole family.  Highly recommend this one!,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My son loves this jumper. He\'s only 3 months, but spends about 10 minutes at a time jumping. It\'s sturdy, easy to put up, and has a cute little tray for toys too! Great product!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My baby loves this jumper..especially since he hit the 5 month mark he loves to actually jump up and down instead of just swishing back and forth.  The price is great too..didn\'t have to spend close to 100$ for those fancy jumper things.  My only gripe is that since it is hanging you have to figure out a way to get your baby in while the jumper swings around..since it is not stationary.  But its not a major issue.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I purchased this because my 3 month old likes to stand so much. We have to put a blanket in it because he doesn\'t fit it at his age. He likes it fairly well in 20 minute doses. It\'s enough for him to be entertained while I shower. It is easily adjustable. He is 16 pounds and approx 24 inches. Our only complaint is graco just slapped the staps together and we had to put them back together because they were twisted around each other.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My son is only 2 months old, but has very strong leg and neck muscles.  It\'s hard to hold him without him trying to ""push-off""of you. I bought this 2 weeks ago, and have used it everyday since!  It is just perfect for him, I just need to pack in a few blankets around him.  He\'ll just bounce and sway in it for hours... then usually fall asleep.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,We bought this for our 5 month old and she loves it. The quality is good and she likes the toys. You definitely have to be aware of how wide your walls are otherwise the clamp won\'t open up wide enough. Great neutral pattern! Its brighter than pictured.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This jumper is awesome! My son loves it. It is the only toy/chair that he will stay in longer than 30 minutes, and we have them all. He loves jumping up and down on his own, and even when he isn\'t jumping he enjoys the freedom of standing on his own. My only complaint is that it\'s a little hard to get him in and out of it by myself. Otherwise, this is perfect entertainment for my 5 month old. I don\'t know what I\'m going to do when he reaches the weight limit!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I chose this one because it was long enough to hang in our eight foot tall doorways. Baby loves it.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This thing is well worth the price I paid, my little guy loves it!  He is 8 mos old, and big for his age.  When we first bought it, we had the seat pulled up the highest it would go, which worked for a while.  Eventually, DS got too big, so we had to figure out a way to shorten the straps.  For a while, we did as someone else suggested and put tennis balls between the straps and the underside of the three spreaders.  That worked.  My husband didn\'t really like that solution though, so he took a large carabiner and wrapped the main hanging strap (between the adjuster and the spreaders) around the carabiner a bunch of times.  If we want to make the seat higher off the ground, we just wrap the strap some more.  As for the bumpers, our guy is so active in this thing, if it was in a regulation width doorway, they would be getting used all the time!! (we have a double wide doorway for him to play in).",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My 4 month old loves this swing!  He laughs and smiles and bounces a lot.Don\'t use if it your child can\'t support his own head yet.  Its really for babies 4 months and up.UPDATE:My son is 6 months old.  He still loves it, but even at the maximum adjusted setting its too close to the ground.  My baby is tall, and if your baby is too then this product is not useful for very long.  Now, his legs are bent when he sits in it and he can even put the lower half of his leg from his knee down flat on the ground.",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,We LOVE this jumper! Our son has a BLAST! So glad we purchased it! It was shipped quickly and has been in use since the moment we got it!,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"At about 4 1/2 months old, my son began to start jumping and banging in his ExerSaucer, so I bought this thinking he would enjoy jumping. I set this up within in minutes and put him in it and boy did he go insane! He fell in love with it, he was grinning ear to ear. My son is very energetic and he bounced all over the place for a solid 15-20 minutes. I think this is such a cute Jumper and so much better than the other jumpers that doesn\'t have a table like this one.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Our 6 month old has a blast each time he\'s in it which is just about daily. He jumps around laughing and giggling, and our 3 yr old daughter dances next to him.  We love the bumpers on all sides so he can\'t hurt himself in the doorway, and it is very sturdy.  It\'s great entertainment for all..highly recommended.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this for my daughter thinking it would be perfect.  No.  The product description when you buy it says weight limit of 96 pounds, it is actually 25.  It will not go over door ways that are not super skinny.  Height doesn\'t adjust very much either. Seat is okay but other issues are leaving me with no other option but to send it back.",2
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This jumper is absolutely fantastic! My son loves to jump- if you hold him while he is standing on your lap, he jumps on you! I stick him in this and he goes nuts, he loves it! This allows me to do the dishes and relax a little! (Not to mention it tires him out so he wants to sleep shortly after) It has a ""bumper"" on it so I can feel secure he won\'t hurt himself and sometimes, I even feed him in it! We tried other jumpers and they wouldn\'t bounce like this one does- the spring is wonderful! I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone looking for a jumper!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I went back and forth between this and an exersaucer finally picking this one and I\'m really glad I did.  This is so compact that it stores easily in our small home but my little guy still gets to bounce, which he loves.  I also bring it with us when we are on long visits because its a good way to let him exert some energy. (and its entertaining to watch him squeal with delight) I do keep a blanket folded up behind him to keep him sitting more upright at 5 months and that seems to help as the seat size is large. Leg holes accommodate his chubby thighs. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"The baby loves this thing!  Lots of hopping and screaming.  It is super easy to ""install"" since you just pull the top open far enough to get past the door facing.  No tools needed.  The only problem I have is that the front strap on the right is slightly longer thus making the baby crooked!  I cannot adjust it either.  There is no mention of this in the instructions and I saw another left leaning baby (in a yellow tee)in a pic someone submitted with their review.  It\'s odd that the straps that hold the tray aren\'t adjustable which is why I had to deduct a star.  I am going to try and rig it up so the baby\'s legs don\'t grow funny!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I got this a few days ago.  It is super easy to put together and to hang on the door frame.  The minute I put my 8 month old in it she was off and jumping.  It seems to be comfortable for her.  She likes the 2 toys that came with it.  It was easy to adjust the height for proper fit too.  It is well put together better than others I\'ve seen.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Son love this thing... The only issue is that I had to rig it a little to make it higher because IDK what type of door ways this thing was made for... but works great!!!,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My daughter is 6 months old and loves this jumper.I use it in the mornings while getting ready, and sometimes she\'ll sit in it and playup to a whole hour! She loves it!The only downfall - It\'s hard to get them out!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My daughter LOVES this doorway jumper! She is now 10 months, cruising all over, and still likes this doorway jumper. She is a tall baby, though (30&#34;). The height adjustment from the manual has helped a lot, but it is also the reason for giving the jumper 4 stars compared to 5.The height adjustment does not stay in place. Maybe my baby is jumping too much? Isn\'t that the point, though? After trying different positions,  have discovered that the white slider adjustment piece needs to be all the way at the top, next to the spring, and then you pull the rope through the other way. Number 1, that\'s confusing. Number 2, it\'s not easy to adjust. I just think this could have been engineered better.Would I buy it again, though? Yes. I have definitely gotten my $30 out of it.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I purchased this for my Grandson because my children had one when they were little and he loved it. I honestly believed it helped him to start walking because just after having it for a month he started taking steps and is a walking machine now. Well worth the price plus it helped build his legs up.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,great but never used his weight over 25lb i returned but there is no doubt in my mind its a benefit and fun my son had one he loved it hes 22now hed fall sleep in it graco too these bern round long,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My husband and I purchased this for our 5 month old son after seeing him in one at his daycare center.  He LOVES the Jumper, and can stay in it for a very long time!  He laughs at himself, and jumps all over the place - it is so much fun to watch him be so happy with something so simple!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"After watching my friend\'s baby in this jumper, I was so excited to order one for my baby. Well, it was a bust at our house. The adjustable strap doesn\'t get small enough to allow my baby to just have the fronts of his feet touching the floor. He ends up flat footed and that\'s even with his knees bent! He is currently 19 lbs and pretty long for his age,but all with in the guidelines from the company for this jumper (max weight is 25 lbs). If your baby is on the &#34;big&#34; side at all, I do not recommend this product.",1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"It\'s a great jumper, my 6 year old who is now crawling, enjoys it for a little while now and then but doesn\'t get very active on it...more like a relaxing thing for her...with one foot touching the floor (because she puts all her weight on one side) she turns to one side and the other, swings herself very softly and starts yawning...",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My baby loves this jumper! It is super easy to hook on to door and easy to clean. The tray will be helpful once she starts eating solids in the months to come too!,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Sturdy and secure, but the highest setting is still way to low even for a 6 mos old .  My door frames are standard height, i have to tie a knot around a wood dow to raise seat height.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This is a great jumper! My little guy is 5 1/2 months, 19# and fits great. We had one of the ones that looked like a car and it was soooo hard to get him in and out, and really noisy. This one is super easy, he slides right in and pops right out. It makes no noise whatsoever when he jumps. The toys that came with it are junk, they came off literally within 30 seconds of him touching them. Just use your own links to attach whatever toys your kid likes. He does have a tendency to lean to one side or the other, but nothing that bothers him, or me. It\'s very easy to adjust the height of the strap, even with him still in it. I would recommend this jumper to anyone!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this for my son at five months old and he loved it. Now, at sixteen months old he still enjoys it! Fits perfectly in door tram and if you look at the instruction booklet, it shows you how to raise it higher.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 5 months old. She loved it! I\'m rating it a 4 star because she\'s almost 6 months now and is almost to tall to use it. I think bouncers like this should have more of an adjustment for taller, bigger babies. I\'m glad I made this purchase, but again... I\'m not so happy that she\'s almost out of it and it\'s only been a MONTH!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Looked for a long time to find a good jumper. After reading all the reviews about the Graco Bumper Jumper I decided to purchase it for my grandson. It\'s the best. It\'s easy to adjust the height and there\'s not alot of ""junk"" that gets in the way. It\'s very sturdy and easy to assemble. I am planning on purchasing another one for a friend who\'s daughter is expecting. It also gives Mom some spare time to get a few things done around the house while keeping an eye on the baby. So glad that I purchased this jumper. It was worth the wait and research.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I just got this jumper and my 9.5 months old daughter loves it. At first I thought maybe I was too late buying it since most of the reviewers had babies younger than mine, but, I\'m glad I did. She loves jumping up and down in this. I highly recommend this jumper.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I purchased a bumper jumper for myself (and my newborn son) 18 years ago. The one here looks the same (just a different color). Mine has been through 5 children and many visiting babies over the years. It is one of the greatest inventions ever! It is true, however, that it will not fit on every door.  I have many doors with extra wide moldings overhead, I was nonetheless able to fit the jumper into my master bedroom, walk-in closet doorway as well as into my bathroom and into a kitchen doorway. I could get ready in the morning, shower, and even cook meals while my children safely spun and bounced. In fact, all of my babies jumped with delight until finally exhausting themselves to sleep. The design is simple and easy to use. The high tension spring with a large clamp expands to fit over most traditional door frame moldings. The weight of the jumper and baby holds it securely in place. The bumper and tray prevents the baby from hitting the door frame (when they go wild) while holding play toys and cheerios. Mine had adjustable hand grips that were great for attaching teethers etc.. There is even an adjustable height control that allows you to adjust for a growing baby. It is wonderful and versatile. Just one thing...if your baby screams when you first try it, make sure you put him in when he is alert and happy. Then gently rock and bounce him yourself the first few times. I even helped my babies bend their little legs and push off the floor when I first put them in. I found that even a tiny baby can get the hang of it fairly quickly. I have loved mine so much I am getting a new one for a friend. I\'d give her my old one, but I\'m sentimentally attached.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My 6 month old LOVES to jump in this! She smiles and laughs the whole time. The two little toys that come with it didn\'t last long...the Velcro is weak, so as soon as baby pulls on them they come off. But, the yellow rings are good for hooking on other toys. It works well in a big doorway.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Maximum recommended weight listed as 96 pounds online In the Amazon description. When the jumper arrived, the maximum weight in the instruction manual is only 25 pounds!!!! VERY disappointed. Our bambini would only be able to use for a few weeks, if that long. Waste of time & money. False advertising.",1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,We have enjoyed this Bumper Jumper.  It was a good purchase.  The only thing we would prefer to see different is the weight limit. The limit is 25 lbs. and our 7 month son who is not crawling or walking loves to jump but is right at the weight limit.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My 6 month old LOVES this!  He jumps for a long time without making a noise with a huge smile on his face.  The only issue I have is getting him out of it.  I have to go from the side and sometimes his little legs and feet get caught but I don\'t know if there is any real way to remedy that.  The bumper around it is great.  He pulled the toys off the second he went it since they are Velcro d on so I attached some different toys with ring links that he can reach and not pull off.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,again a gift and receiver never said when they got it but think it was good service as I heard no complaints. but baby is not born yet either so do not know what the condition of the jumper until Sept/,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Overall, our 6 month old loves the jumper! Plus, it is super easy to put up. Reading the reviews for other similar products, I would still choose this one. The four star rating comes from these things to keep in mind:Leg HolesFor some reason, the leg holes in this jumper are enormous. Really, I\'m not sure who it was designed for. They are even much too big for our 6 year old. I constructed another very simple seat, mirroring her walker\'s 14 inch circumference leg holes, and sewed it into the existing seat- works fine! Without it, it was just okay- mostly, she would sink into one of the leg openings which made her uneasy and lob-sided.Door SizeIf you use this on a smaller door (under the regular three foot door frame), you DO have to watch to make sure their arms don\'t get jammed as they jump. Unfortunately, due to the molding on our doors (see below), the only place we can put it up is a smaller bathroom doorway, so we have to be careful.Wall & MoldingAs another reviewer states, you have to be sure your walls are under 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) thick. Also, look to see how close the molding/door frame goes up to the ceiling. It needs to have about 1.5 inches (4 cm) between the molding and the ceiling for it to properly attach.Initial ReactionOur daughter\'s initial reaction to it- scared! I\'m not sure what it was; she has the walker and has used a floor bouncer, both of which she liked. We had her sit in the jumper, resting on the bed. She was fine with that and after an hour or so, we put it up. She started bouncing and hasn\'t looked back.We\'re still glad we bought the jumper, and our baby girl enjoys it!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"The instructions aren\'t the best, and attaching the seat can be a bit of a challenge. It would be nice if the spring would open a little wider to accomodate just about any doorway too, but it is what it is, and baby loves it. Arrived in 1 day with Amazon 2 day Prime Shipping. 5 stars for Amazon!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This jumper is amazing! My little one has been very active since the day he was born and this has been a god send. At four months i purchased this. He weighed around 15 pounds and it was a little big for him so i just put a stuffed animal under his arms so they slip inside . The tray is awesome it allows him to have some toys to chew on in between jumps. He loves it, I love it. Easy to assemble. Very cute. Comes with two toys that he loves. Great buy.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This product would have gotten a 5 star review if they made it more adjustable so that tall babies can use it too. If you have a tall baby, you better have really high door frames, because this just doesn\'t adjust high enough. We have it on the highest setting and our son\'s feet are flat on the ground. You want their toes to barely be touching the ground so they jump up and down. When their feet are flat on the ground they just sit there.Other than that, it\'s great.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My grandson just loves this and is building his coordination and leg strength...it\'s amazing that he has made progress holding up his head too! He just loves it for as long as you let him play ...I wish it had an interactive component that when he bounced it made a sound ...to reward him .....just thinkin\',5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I ordered this for a friends baby shower. It not only came in quickly it was at least $10.00 cheaper then where she had registered. So excited to give this to her! Her and her little princess with enjoy this so much!,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"So sad that my son will be outgrowing this soon, he really enjoys it! The first time he bounced it was magical, he laughed and jumped for such a long time! This has also helped tremendously in both me and my husband being able to take showers while my son jumps in the doorway!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"We love the Graco Bumper Jumper! Our 8 month old twin girls loved it so much, we had to buy two!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Excellent buy except for one thing: The height adjustment needs to be extended. My grandson will be able to use it for only about two months unless I employ a method of shortening the hanging strap that is outside what the jumper itself provides. Not cool.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Very sturdy and nicely built. I see some three and two star reviews complaining that the height is not adjustable, what happened to creativity.... If it is too long, tie a knot. If it is too short, just use some extension ribbon. It is very flexible and covers a wide range of doors frames and kid sizes. If you are on the extreme sizes and happen to bought it, just take 5 min... Altering it to fit your use is not that difficult. Kids love it, lot of times they just fall asleep after playing in for a while. I dont advice, leaving the kids to sleep in it, but it is so comfortable. For the price, you can\'t ask for more. Has soft rubber bumpers to protect the kids when they hit hard objects. Very well thought and designed product.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,The length in this jumperoo is too long that my baby could only use it when he was 60 cm....and that was the setting for the shortest length.,2
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"The jumper works great.  Our twin daughters really enjoy taking turns using it.  It keeps each one entertained for about 30 minutes which is long enough to allow us to get some things done, like dishes or even eat a meal.  The only problem we have is that the suspension straps are not level, so we had to rig one of them to make it level.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Our little one loved this bouncy chair. It is only relevant for about 6 months but it is so worth it for that period of time. She had lots of energy and loved to entertain herself bouncing.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"After trying two other jumpers -- one that was WAY too wobbly and one that was really noisy -- we ordered this one. It\'s been perfect.The strap is fairly long so we had to tie a knot in it, because our son is fairly tall and pretty heavy, but it\'s worked like a charm since. He\'s happy. We\'re happy. Good buy.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My little girl loves jumping in this! We had to make an extra bracket to install (old house). I would buy this agian in a heart beat.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My three month old absolutely loves this jumper.  I purchased the hugga bebe for him to be able to fit and it works great.  Definately recommended.UPDATE::I purchased this about 4 months ago for my three month old and it WAS great for a while.  When he was actually big enough to fit in the thing properly, there was no more strap to take up and he practically sits on the floor.  I wish it was designed for standard door frames so he could actually use it.  Too bad.",2
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My husband and I purchased this jumper not even a week ago and since day one our baby boy has loved it. He is only 3months and he is always bouncing away! I highly recommend this to anyone. Also it always seems to put him to sleep as well so that is a definite plus! :) I think it has good spring action too.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My daughter loves this jumper!!!! Its nice and simple also putting it together took no time.Glad I brought it.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"...for the baby and the family watching him go at it.  My six month old absolutely loves his jumper.  If he starts to slow down we say ""bouncy, bounce"" and he starts up again.  Nice, deep hook mechanism fits over my very wide 100 year old molding and extra thick plaster walls with absolutely no damage.  The toys it came with took about 5 seconds for my son to remove--tiny amonut of velcro holding them in place--but they make a cute addition to the stash of toys in his pack and play.  Money very well spent.  I\'ll be very sorry when he outgrows it.  In fact my only complaint is that the weight limit states 25 lbs of which he\'s only 4 lbs shy, but he\'s no where close to pulling up/standing on his own.  May be tempted to keep using for a bit longer--the jumper itself seems very well constructed and sturdy and my molding can certainly handle it.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I enjoy using this and it was shipped so quickly I loved it right away.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"The only issue I have with this jumper is that it doesnt have a belt, so if you have little one that is more slightly built they can slump a bit.  You can use a towel or something to help prop but I found that tended to slip to the side and the baby would then kind of slump to one side or the other pinned in!  Otherwise very well built and sturdy product.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This was given as a gift so I can\'t give a fair review (thus 3 stars because I had to rate to send) of how well it works or how easy it is to set up.  However, the product arrived on time as described.",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"We tried a cheap jumper that the grandparents bought, and that\'s when we realized how awesome this one really was. Our baby started enjoying this when he started sitting up with support. We tucked a blanket around him for some extra support at first, but he has grown into it. He is now 9 months and there are days when he will get 45 straight minutes of happy enjoyment out of this (which is a lifesaver when I\'m folding laundry, doing dishes, just want to read a book, etc.)Our doorways on the first floor are VERY high, so we were not able to use it on that floor until he was tall enough/ heavy enough to touch the floor on the longest strap adjustment. On the second floor, with normal doorway heights, he has started to get nearly too tall on the shortest strap adjustment, so I did a little bootleg adjustment and stuck a rolled up pair of socks under each strap where it joins at the top. It shortened it just enough that we will get a couple more months of enjoyment out of it!!!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this item for a friend, who recently had a baby girl. When I had my children, I found the jumper to be one of the best items available to keep your child content. I searched many jumpers and found that this one seemed to best suit my friend\'s taste and was the best all around in comparison to others. She loves it and, more importantly, her daughter loves it. She says that it is very secure, with many activities to engage the child. Her daughter jumps in it for hrs. The color is wonderful, very gender neutral. She would recommend this product.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My three (almost four) month old absolutely loves this jumper. The tray is nice to set her toys on and she also likes to hang onto it when she starts jumping. Very entertaining for the LO and she is able to move around and not have to be held or on her back all the time. Very easy to set up and take down and to adjust the height.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"It would be better if it was easier to get my child in and out, but other than that, he loves it!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Easy to put together and, my son just loves it! He loves bouncing in it while I\'m doing laundry. Great buy",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Excellent quality! Had many bouncers before, this is by far the best yet! This one has a higher back in the seat than all the others which helps to support a your baby when bouncing. We didn\'t even have to place a blanket around our 4 month old to make it more stable like we did other bouncers.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My son loves to move around to a new scene every 5 minutes. However, he stays in this jumper for 15-20 minutes sometimes. He does not like any other jumper either. The tray makes him sturdy, since he is 5 months, and helps him not to bang into the side of the wall.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This product was everything I expected, plus the baby loves it! Very happy with my decision to purchase this item and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a baby jumper!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"We were very excited about ordering this product and even had it sent overnight so we could try it out. Unfortunately, the clamp that secures the jumper to the door frame does not accommodate the moldings in older houses. Our house was built in 1918 so the mouldings are pretty substantial but not crazy large and the clamp will not fit over the moulding..it misses by 2 inches so, we\'ll be returning this product.",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My 6-month old son loves bouncing around in the Jumper, especially to music. However, there is no easy way to adjust the length of the main rope, which makes this Jumper usable for only a short time. We\'ve come up with a temporary fix involving a rolled up washcloth, but it\'s not pretty and won\'t last very long.",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,The clamp\'s feet that cling to the walls really chewed up the paint and Sheetrock. I would recommend anyone that gets this attach contact paper or something on the wall to protect it. Also it\'s difficult to get the child in and out due to the design. It\'s impossible for my wife to set it up because she can\'t reach up high enough. Last but not least my son used it about 4 times and hates it. I finally put it away and ate the $40 because he would pitch a fit when I would walk towards it with him. I\'ve heard kids really like these things. Mine sure didn\'t.,3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This looks like it would be great and a lot of fun, but unfortunately we never got to use it.  We had to return it because the clamp was too small for our doorway.  Our house was built between 1900-1912.  I have heard that the Sassy Jumper works for older homes, we will give that one a try.",1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Our 4-month old is having SO much fun in this jumper.  She sometimes jumps with her arms down in the leg holes, but still seems to have a blast.  She has smashed her fingers a few times, but she\'s having so much fun she doesn\'t even pay attention to any pain it might have caused.  I definitely like the tray b/c she will play with Sophie the teething toy (another must-have in my opinion!).  She will usually play in the jumper from 10-30 minutes...long enough to let me get some dishes or laundry done!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Our 5 month old looooves this. It is easy to set up & transport. Very secure & safe, highly recommend it!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Great product. excellent quality. would recommend to everyone. my boy is 5.5 months and he loves this jumper. every time he is in the jumper he forgot about everything and starts to jump even if he was crying 2 seconds ago,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This is a great product, I would definitely recommend this to others. Our eight month old loves spending time in the jumper.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,It worked great! I would buy another as a gift to some for a baby shower and pass it down.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"We\'ve been using this jumper since my baby was 3.5 months old. He likes it, and he\'s just getting the hang of jumping. That being said, my only complaint is that he is almost too tall for it already! He\'s a very, very tall baby for his age, and I\'m pretty sure he won\'t be able to use it long, even when adjusting to the highest setting. Otherwise, this is a great and fun product!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This jumper is great for the price and in functionality. I researched many other jumpers that aesthetically looked better in our home. Many were too expensive or unavailable, only found in Europe, or had ridiculous shipping charges. We had been trying to avoid too many baby items that were bulky and made from plastic, but we settled on this one. Our 5 month old loved it and used it until she was about 8.5 months. She was an early walker at 10 months, so she reached a point of wanting to move around herself. It could last longer depending on the baby. Look online to see the exact distance the feet should be from the ground when bouncing. The bouncer is pretty light and easy to move from door to door. The toys that come with it to hang from the rings are pretty cheap with velcro that doesn\'t stay when pulled. I just attached different toys or none at all.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I never write reviews but love this product so much that I just had to!  This jumper was a lifesaver!  Our 3 month old son hated being strapped into a seat, which made it hard for my husband and I to do anything without holding him.  He loved to stand when we held him so we thought the jumper would be a good idea.  He LOVED it from the minute we put him in it!  The tray provides something to sit toys on and for him to lean on.  It saves us a lot of space versus one of those exersaucers.  My only complaint is that I wish it could adjust to become shorter.  He is now 5 1/2 months old and on regular door frames, he is almost too tall to bounce.  But, even if we only get a few more months out of it, it was well worth the money!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,This item arrived today and we love it!  My son is 3 months old and loved jumping and spinning around!  It was like it gave him a sense of freedom and put a huge smile on his face!  Seems sturdy and safe.  love it!,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,MY SON LOVED THIS JUMPER. HE HAS SPENT HOURS IN IT. SOME OF OUR HAPPIEST MOMENTS OF VIDEO WHEN HE WAS JUST A FEW MONTHS OLD WERE IN THIS SEAT!! LOVED IT!! 3MO-11MO.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I bought this jumper for my six month old grandson.  It is so sturdy and an easy hang on a door jam. The seat cushion is comfy and the level from  the floor can be easily adjusted.  My grandson loves to jump for hours.  He smiles and laughs each time he is in it.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Our grandson seems to love it. Have read a report that babies should be kept off their toes, but the small &#34;risk&#34; if there really is one, seems minor compared the amount of exercise the baby gets bouncing around",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I like to gift this item to most new babies around me. I have still to know one who didn\'t love it. Moms love it too because besides the fun, it gives them a little rest.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I love this jumper. It is a Christmas present for my 4 month old daughter. She will enjoy it. I tested it on our doorway and it works wonderfully. Perfect height and everything.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Our baby likes this jumper.  I like that it has a shelf around it so he can\'t hurt this hands in the door way.  He likes to pull the animals from the side off.  I put other toys on there as well.  My baby has been playing with this since 4 months and is now six months and still likes it.  However, even now I need to put a blanket or towel around him because it is too spacy for him.  With the blanket it is better.  Our only real complaint is that it is tricky to shorten when baby grows.  It takes some skill and you need two people unless you continue to take baby in and out to measure where his feet are.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This is a very good jumper.  Although it did not fit around the trim on our doors, which is wider than typical, so we had to screw a hook into a header over a doorway to hang it.  Also, I think I missed my baby\'s window of interest as she started crawling just before the jumper arrived and now she doesn\'t like to be contained.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My daughter turned into a jumping bean and I thought this would be great - and it is. The problem is it\'s a little big for her. Now, she is about 15 lbs....so she\'s not teeny. But the seat area is very wide, offeriing her no support. So, when she goes to jump, she has to hold on, or she\'ll flop around. This is especially a problem if she throws her head back and jumps, because she could hit the door or door frame! Until she gets bigger, we put a really soft blinket around the back, as a cushion and also pushing her forward, where the tray protects her from bumping into the corners of the door or door frame. She is buiilding muscles and coordination with it and likes the little hanging toys though. Oh, and the tray...not sure how that works. Any kick would knock food right off it.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"We received the jumper very promptly after placing our order. It was very easy to assemble and within minutes it was ready to go. We put our 6 month old daughter in it for the first time and it didn\'t take long for her to start bouncing and giggling. Now it\'s her favorite pass time. We tried several other ""gadgets"" before discovering the jumper. Now we can accomplish simple things like cooking dinner or washing dishes and our daughter stays happy because she feels like she\'s a part of what\'s going on. She can sit up, turn around in it to follow us and when she gets excited, bounce. Great product!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"It is easy to install/move around.  Seems stable and secure and our daughter is large.  She hasn\'t figured out the jumping part yet and may outweigh it before she does.  That is the only down side for us, the weight limit.  Our daughter really likes the toys with it.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My grandaughter is now 9 months old and loves this jumper, she gets in it and has learned to spin! She will go in a circle backwards both directions and laughs and giggles until she is silly. We get such a kick out of watching her and have video taped her to send to all our friends and family who think it is hilarious! The construction is very well made and she is protected from bumping into anything when she does her special thing. She also bounces in it but enjoys the spin the most! I highly recommend it to everyone with a little one, they can become creative in thier own technique and enjoy it many ways.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Our first daughter didn\'t like the jumper but she just didn\'t like being in one spot!! Our second daughter loves it. She loves to jump around in it and she loves to swing in it.  We pull her up where she can\'t touch the floor and we swing her.  She will stay in her jumper for a long time which is great for parents. Esp parents with an older busy body toddler.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My mother bought us this for our 8 month old and he LOVES jumping and being able to look outside. He finds it very comfortable, and likes the excercise. My only complaint is the toys that come with it do not stay on very well, which frustrates our son a bit. I am glad for the bumper, it does serve a purpose. All in all I would tell every parent to get one it helps baby excercise, and gives your arms a rest.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Our son LOVED this jumper! Our house is full a mix of high ceilings, low ceilings, strange nooks, etc. There were only a couple of doorways where we could hang this, and eventually had to sew it a bit shorter, but it did the trick. Hour after hour after hour! It was easy to clean and despite all kinds of use and abuse, it still looks like new, as do the toys/attachments.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,This jumper is much better than others I have tried.  It really does let your little one jump.  The others are more of a swing and don\'t have much give to them.  My grand girl loves this and can really get her jump on!,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This is an amazing buy for the money. We bought this jumper for our son when he was 4 months and really seemed to want to stand. (And was strong enough to hold up his head/neck). He immediately took to the jumper as soon as we put him in it! At first he was a little small for it (16 pounds) so we had to use towels to help him comfortably fit. But he loved jumping in it, and it was a great way for him to get out energy. It also kept him happy longer then any other activity (like 45 minutes - 1 hour, which is amazing). It\'s also pretty light and easy to take with you, so I took it on the plane with me and used it at my Mom\'s house and then brought it back home with me. Now that he is 6 months he stays in it for hours over the course of a day. I think the only downside is he would rather jump then crawl lol, but it really is a great energy releaser for him.The one thing we noticed (we did a lot of grand parent house jumping over the holidays) - the door frame you use this on needs to have the molding on both sides of the door. I wish we could put this wherever, but you are limited to the nearest door frame. It really holds up well though. It does slightly scratch the paint above the door frame if you have a crazy jumper.I would highly recommend this, its a must buy!!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My now 6 month old would live in this if I let her. she falls asleep jumping on a regular basis. First put her in at 4 months and it helped support her instability. well made, if your using it in a stand door frame, look at the directions closely and you will see how to make it shorter for tall babies. it didn\'t take long for her to need it higher.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,You cannot beat the price of this jumper and it is worth every penny!  I love that it\'s pretty basic and not too much of an eye sore since it lives in the center of our house because our son loves it so much.  I can easily move it from one doorway to the next if I need and it gives me time to actually cook or clean!  I looked at several jumpers and landed on this one because of the great reviews - I was not disappointed!,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,This swing is awesome! My 4.5 month old son loves it and would stay in it all day if I let him.  I hang it on our bathroom door when I am getting ready in the morning. We can now play and have a \'conversation\' before I go to work. It is really easy to put together and hang. It is also easy to move it around the house.  This thing is worth its weight in gold.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this when the stationary exersaucer I bought was ginormous!  This is small enough to get around, but sturdy enough that I feel my daughter is safe.  When I first bought this my daughter was about 10 pounds (2 months), so I had to stack towels around her so she wouldn\'t all over, but now that she\'s 4 months old I don\'t need to do that.  She will spend at least an hour in this thing!  She loves jumping and swinging.  There is a bumper all around so she can\'t knock into things.  It is easy to adjust the height.  Although I\'m thinking this won\'t get &#34;high&#34; enough.  She is currently 24 inches tall and I have it almost as tall as it will go (not quite) and she can put her feet flatly on the ground.  Although once she much taller she will be crawling and walking and won\'t want to bounce...  All in all a great purchase!  Money well spent!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"As soon as we put our baby in the jumper, we was entranced.  We have not had much luck with the activity mat, he would only stay there for a few minutes at most.  But with the jumper, he absolutely loves it!  It\'s absolutely great and I strongly recommend.Info: Our son is 3 months old and 16.5 lbs.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This is the absolute best baby product I have purchased for my son yet. I got it when he was 3 months old and he immediately loved it and will jump on it for as long as I let him! Until I got this bouncer, I had to hold him all the time because he didn\'t like to lay down. Now I actually do things while he bounces in this! I love it even more when it\'s bright and early in the morning and my son wants to wake up so I put him in the bouncer and sleep for a couple more minutes ;)My son has never fell asleep in the bouncer like many of the user photos show but I don\'t think that\'s a good angle for their neck anyway.This is much bouncier than the Combi car bouncer/walker I got him although that is also a great product for other reasons.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My granddaughter lives with us and I ordered this after reading many reviews of other items that were similar.  This had great reviews and now I know why!  She LOVES it and we LOVE it.  Although we all love our children very much, there are times our arms get tired, or we have something we need to get done that can\'t be done one handed and we need to know they are safe and happy.  This has filled that need very well.  The little tray on the front is a nice touch and it has two little hooks (toys come attached but have velcro and didn\'t stay on too long. Although she still loves the toys and plays with them other places)  We just attached our own toys on the hooks and it worked great!  We would recommend this product.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This is so easy to hang on a door frame.  My little grandson is 4 months old, and loves to bounce.  He laughs and smiles.  He will play in it for about 15 minutes.  Any more than that, and he wants out.......but he is small still.  I think as he gets older he may like to play in it a little longer.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This should not be this difficult to do but apparently it is and without everyone\'s feedback i would not have been able to figure it out.  Personally, it\'s not worth the hassle....it\'s going back.",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Whenever baby begins to fuss, this bouncer saves the day! At 5 months he\'s super happy bouncing in his jumper. He loves the toys that come with it too. He can pull them off quite easily and we end up taking them with us in the car because he enjoys them so much. The guard around the sides is perfect to keep him safely away from the doorway and the tray in front is big enough for a suction toy for added fun. Really glad I went with this one!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This bumper jumper is super cute. It\'s easy to adjust the height and hasn\'t damaged any walls. The bumper is also a nice feature. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the toys were always right in our son\'s face when he turned his head to either side, so we just removed them.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My son loves this jumper, but I was absolutely appalled to find blue ink smearing onto the tray from the Graco label printed on the product (label is printed on the front of the tray, well within arms reach for a child who uses the surface for his/her arms.)  We have central air in our home, so the product was not stored/exposed to extreme heat prior to use or during.  My son, 6 months old, had BLUE INK all over his hands and mouth from the label bleeding. Upon google searching the issue, I found that others had also experienced the same problem and that GRACO WAS NOT RESPONDING TO THEM WITH THEIR CONCERNS.  This is very alarming to me, as in this day and age, there is NO EXCUSE for this.  How was this overlooked, especially since it is the brand name being printed on the product -- you would think Graco would take better care when branding their items with their name.  Disgusting and truly sad, as otherwise, it is a great product and my son has loved it. Makes me wonder what else could be in this product that is not safe for my child to be putting his mouth on and playing with.",1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I rarely write reviews - but this was too good not to add to the rave reviews.  My daughter LOVES this - she is 6 months, we noticed at 4 months she loved to jump.  Since this was my second child, I wanted a relatively small investment for the jumper.  It hangs nicely in the doorway and it has a nice tray.  The bumper keeps her from getting hurt.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"As other posters have noted, you can only shorten this jumper so much. My baby is 7 months old and is small (25 inches). We\'ve shortened the jumper as much as it can go and even tied a knot in it, but it is still way too long. She loves it, but she can\'t do much jumping in it. Instead of ""the jump-up,"" we call it the ""stand around and look cute."" We\'re going to get another one that we can shorten enough that she can actually jump in it. I wouldn\'t get this version, because even if you have a smaller baby, your baby will quickly grow out of this one.",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"If I could post a picture of the smile on my daughter\'s face when she is in this, that would be enough of a review. She loves it!  I also like it because it is very easy to move from doorway to doorway, seems well built, and is very reasonably priced. Great product.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This item is a must have for babies. I wish I had brought it for my older kid. Initially, my husband was against it thinking he had to get his tools out to fix the thing somewhere (that part is not clear in the description of the item), but later we saw a video demonstration and went ahead and ordered it.It is so flexible, can be hooked to any door, removed in a jiffy and put back without any nuts, bolts or drilling! As long as you have a doorway with a frame, this works. And saves your back while giving your little one great exercise. What a neat concept!The only modification we did, was to add some padding to the clamps so the paint would not scrap, if at all that happens.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My 5 month old absolutely adores this bouncer. He\'ll sit in it forever if you let him and just bounce like crazy. We started using it when he was 4 months- took him a minute to catch on, but once he got it he could not be stopped.My only complaints- it\'s really hard to get your child in to the bouncer. Even if he\'s holding still it\'s difficult to slip him in. Also, the bucket is pretty big. Wt first we had to put a towel behind him to keep him from putting his arms in his lap, but now he holds the toys/handles.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Before you eye-roll, hear me out.The jumper, for the most part is made well.  However, as a previous customer mentioned, the adjustable strap is much too long - even for my petite infant.  Please read below for my issue with the factory quality:Also, (DID NOT REALIZE AT FIRST) the metal piece (picture a miniature dumbell)that holds the adjustable strap & seat the the upper spring & clamp, was not properly in place (from the factory).  For a while I couldn\'t figure out why the seat would always tilt to one side.  Then, after a month\'s use, I notice the plastic casing for the metal screw-like piece was dislodging from the upper section.  So I would wiggle it back in place, thinking my baby just had really strong legs.  Eventually, it became more difficult to finagle, so I took it down and throroughly inspected the thing.  Turns out the metal piece had complete dislodged from its section and somehow (from the vigorous jumpin I suppose) slid to one side.  I tried so hard to maneuver it back in place, but it was useless.  I stopped using the jumper, since it did not seam safe anymore.  I feel silly, not looking at things with a closer eye...because it could have been dangerous and if I cought the deffect early on, it would have been possible to replace.THE END",2
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Our friend had one of these and her baby loved it. Ours HATES it. He screams the second he is in it. You may want to try one out with your baby before purchase. This is the first item my son has hated.,3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I was unsure how good this was going to be because of a few negative reviews. I\'m glad I don\'t base all my decisions on others\' experiences. My main concern was whether or not it was strong and safe. Now that I have seen him in it all those concerns are gone. It is well constructed and strong. It holds well on the entrance molding that separates the kitchen and the living room. The wider the space, the better. Just because it doesn\'t fit on a certain door/opening doesn\'t make it a bad product.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,It came as advertised. I just wish it could be adjusted a little higher. My little one is only 6 months and already too tall for it.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Bought this as a gift for friends.  But, my daughter has one for her children.  The kids have so much fun in them.  These are particularly nice because they stay stable and the babies don\'t fall over in them.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Our little one loves this jumper. The pics of babies sleeping in it are a little worrisome... I hope people don\'t get the idea that this jumper is for putting baby in and leaving him or her there until they fall asleep. There is no way a baby\'s posture is supported for sleep in this thing. It is WONDERFUL for when baby has energy to burn but can\'t walk or crawl yet.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My 5 month old b/g twins love this.  The only thing I don\'t like about it is having to adjust the strap all the time so that they are up higher.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Baby LOVES this thing. Bouncebouncebounce, for 5 to 20 minutes at a time depending on her mood. Once she actually leaned forward on the tray and went to sleep in it. Stable enough not to dump her out even when she did that. The plastic tray doubles as a place to play with toys and a stabilizer, it seems.The bumpers really work.  She could theoretically get her fingers caught between the bumper and a doorway now that she\'s bigger, but the design of the toy tray/bumper makes that unlikely (even now that she\'s at the upper end of recommended user size).It came out of the box very easy to put together. I can attach it to door frames without any assistance.Only wish it would accommodate larger babies... she\'s outgrowing it now.By way of comparison:  We also tried the Evenflo Jump Up, but it never seemed put together quite right. Less stable -- the baby would flop over forward in it. Observers wondered if she would fall out. While that never happened, she\'d get burns on her arms from leaning on its frame & ropes to stabilize herself.  I had to get help to clamp it into doorways.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this because I remembered that we had them growing up and loved them. This one works just fine, but after seeing how much he loves the other bouncers (not the ones that hang from the door) we wished we could throw this one away (we just hate to waste the $$) so it\'ll probably go to Grandma\'s house.",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,This thing allowed me to get the dishes done so many nights while baby jumped. It\'s really strong and secure.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My son is 4 months old and this is my new best friend! It is very user friendly and portable. We even took it camping with us.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My husband and I purchased this for our son when he was four months old.  It is one of the best purchases we have made for him.  We wanted a jumper that didn\'t make noise, have lots of attached toys and didn\'t take up too much space.  This doorway jumper meets all of these criteria.  Our son quickly figured out how to jump and was soon entertaining himself for at least twenty minutes.  He has been in it for as long as an hour without wanting out.  The doorway jumper enabled us to work in the kitchen, do something in the dining room and eat without a fussy baby.  Prior to having the jumper, our son only entertained himself for maybe 10 minutes at a time.  I will say that this jumper works for our house because we have a very wide ""doorway"" between the kitchen and the dining room.  Our son is a vigorous jumper and in a narrower doorway he would be bumping into the door frame.  Still, we thoroughly enjoy watching our son happily bouncing not only up and down, but as far as the spring allows, back and forth like a swing and in wide circles.  The only down side to this jumper is that our seven-month-old son weighs around 23 pounds and will soon be too heavy to use it.  I gave it four stars because five stars implies perfection and no product is perfect.  This works for our son, but might not work for other babies.",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"my son absolutely love this thing! I have never seen him so excited about something like this, but every time my wife walks by this with my son in her arms he starts laughing and reaching for it! HIGHLY recommend this product!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My daughter loves this jumper. It is easy for her to bounce in, has cute toys for her to play with, and has a tray for putting other toys, etc. I also like that the tray creates a sort of bumper guard to keep her from smacking the door frame. It\'s a little difficult to get her in and our of, but I don\'t think the design could really be altered to fix that.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Purchased this as our 6 month old son was getting comfortable with sitting up and needed something new to keep himself entertained.  He really enjoyed his activity center so we decided to give this bouncer a try.  Our little man loves bouncing in this and it\'s easy to move around the house.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a baby who enjoys bouncing.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My 4 1/2 month old Grandson spends approximately 30 minutesin this jumper every day.  He feels so independent!  He is ableto turn it around and find Mommy!He\'ll be enjoying this jumper for a few more months.Instructions clearly show how high to adjust the jumperoff the floor so his little feet touch the floor just right.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My 5-month-old daughter loves this jumper.  She will happily play in it for an hour or two.  The jumper is easy to assemble and place on the doorjamb, although this process definitely requires two hands (something of a luxury with a 5-month-old!).  The jumper is very height-adjustable; once you think you\'ve reached the end, you CAN adjust it further!  If you (like me) accidentally threw out the instructions with the box, you can view them online[...].  The only complaint i have about this product is that it\'s quite difficult to maneuver the baby into and out of the seat, since the strap design makes you wiggle them through a series of convoluted strapping.  Also, if you\'re tall or have back problems, this process will really not work for you.  For our needs, though, it\'s been great!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,My son can spend hours jumping!  He\'s 5 months old (about 17lbs) and is getting better at holding himself up.  It\'s very light and can be easily moved from place to place.,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,I hung this in my doorways. Even on the highest setting it is too close to the ground.  My son is in the 3rd percentile for high so I\'m not sure why this thing is so low. Beware if you have lower doorways. This won\'t work.,1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this for my newborn and she loves it! I have not had issues with the adjustable strap but wanted to mention there are several great reviews with instructions on how to remedy this. My daughter will stay in this for a hour at a time - bouncing and giggling, great while trying to get dinner on the table!",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,,5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"My daughter loves this bouncer!  We take it everywhere we go...she loves it so much that she falls asleep in it & gets mad when you take her out!  My nephew is one month younger than her (3 1/2 months) & weighs 6 pounds more than my daughter & he does not quite understand the concept yet of jumping--so he doesn\'t enjoy it as much, but my daughter jumps her little heart out & doesn\'t want to get out!  We even take it from room to room for her!",5
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,"What can I say?  After hauling around and hassling with big, bulky car seats for almost six years, using this car seat is a breeze!  What\'s not to like?!  We tend to use this seat on shorter trips when our daughter won\'t be falling asleep.  We also have a booster with a back, that\'s the one was use for longer road trips.",5
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,"This is the third one I\'ve bought.  They are inexpensive and easy to use.  I put one in my mother\'s car and sent one each to out of state places we frequently visit.  It\'s much easier (and cheaper, now) than having to check a car seat on the airplane.  It makes the seatbelt fit perfectly on my 5 year old.  Although for her everyday carseat, she has a high back booster with headguards, which are generally safer.",4
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,"Due to differing laws regarding child seats in different states, we happen to be legal without them here in NH. However, our parents live in IL, where seats are going to be required for several more years. On a recent trip to IL in which we flew to Chicago, we realized that it was actually cheaper to buy new seats for my twins and ship them to my mother-in-law\'s house than it was to pay the ridiculous airline baggage fees each way. This way, too, we could leave the seats there for the next few years and not worry about it.This is a great basic seat, perfect for what it is. The seats we do still tend to use here at home, even though they aren\'t required, are also Graco. They are a little nicer, having a tempurpedic type seat stuffing material that is more comfortable, but they are the convertible bottom portion of the full backed booster style that was significantly more expensive.For a secondary seat, these are perfect. They were very economical and work great. The basic pattern is better for my nearly 7 year olds than the character patterns which they are already pretty much beyond.I believe that the covers are washable, but of course as these are sitting in IL and were only used for 4 days, I can\'t comment on that part of it.My children always enjoy having their own cupholders, too. These in the seat are easier to reach than the ones in our van, for sure, and my mother-in-law\'s car doesn\'t have them in the back seat.I really recommend this as a replacement or secondary booster.",4
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,This product seems to be good quality and a reasonable price.  Very satisfied with item,5
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,"Simple, does what it supposed to, reasonable price, durable, holds up well in cold weather, kids like it, easy to clean",4
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,I bought this booster car seat because I often chauffer my grandson around and I got tired of borrowing his car seat and having to return it immediately after using it. He\'s six years old and big for his age. This seat allows me to easily use the rear seatbelts to comfortably secure him in place. My daughter paid three times as much for his booster seat and it\'s identical in design and quality to this one. I really can\'t see a reason to pay more. My grandson\'s safety while he\'s riding with me is of the utmost importance so I was prepared to return this item if it didn\'t measure up. Since the price differential was so huge I was prepared for something that might not be as good but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a terrific value for the money and I highly recommend it. CAUTION: It should NOT be used for infants or toddlers.,5
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,Lightweight and practical booster seat. Easy to carry between vehicles or cheap enough to have one per car if required. Works well for my 5.5year old.,4
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2008","fold up very easily, but the changing table part is only supported on one side and has bent by 6 weeks, so the little one slides over to one side. also, the changing part is too low if you\'re even a little tall.",3
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2008","Product is all that was promised. I was missing the animals for the mobile and emailed Graeco to get them. They promptly replied and sent me a whole new mobile with the animals at no cost to me in less than a week.Thank you,C. Rubio",5
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2008","I am very pleased with this pack \'n play. We used it as a crib for the first month and are now using it as a secondary sleep place. While it can be challenging to set up and take down, the instructions are very clear and after a few attempts, it will come naturally. This PnP is much sturdier than another playard (BabyTrend) we borrowed for a weekend trip. The only complaint I have is that the changing table and mobile don\'t fit in the storage bag. While I could care less about bringing the mobile on vacation, it would be nice if the changing table would fit (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). Also, it is worth noting that the changing table pieces are difficult to take apart. Overall good, sturdy PnP--I would highly recommend.Update April 2011: I used this for baby #2 and it is still working well. We\'ve taken it all around the world so it has had its fair share of baggage handler tossing--it is still sturdy. Love it.Update December 2012: I am still using this product for baby #3. It has held up well, but the bassinet feature is starting to sag a little. But, after 3 being used three times, I would say this thing is quite durable.",4
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2008","Overall a pretty good product.  However, I do have a few complaints.  The mobile is garbage and just gets in the way - we threw it away.  The change table slants to one side and causes the baby to roll.  It is, however, compact when stripped down and isn\'t bad for the price.  The side caddy is very handy for diapers and wipes.",4
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2008","This playard is good like all the Pack and Play basic playards. It folds relatively easily and the wheels are convenient to move it from one room to the other. I really like the attachment that stores diapers,cream, wipes (in a small case) and pacifiers. Some models don\'t have this attachment which is really useful. But I didn\'t like the mobile nor the sound device. The bears are too pale and it doesn\'t have any music or movement. My daughter didn\'t like it at all. The sounds and light device is another disaster because the light is too low and you almost can\'t hear the music (I just put it away).  I have the Winnie the Pooh playard and its mobile is much better although it doesn\'t have a space to store anything.",3
"Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2008",Well when I wasnt stabbing myself with the manual. It was very easy to put together.  I think it could use more cushion for the baby and the wheels dont move that freely.  Other wise it was the best for the money.,3
"Graco Lovin\' Hug Open Top Swing with Vibration, Betsey","Loved this swing - for the price - we paid $100 it had everything we needed.  Music, soothing sounds, swinging, vibrating and a hanging toy to stare at.  The seat reclines to 3 positions which is nice and has a tray for when they are a little bigger to place toys/food/bottle etc.  Make sure you use buckle AND tray when they get a little bigger so they dont fall out when trying to stand/climb.",5
"Graco Lovin\' Hug Open Top Swing with Vibration, Betsey","This swing is overall excellent, good value for the money. It is sturdy and safe, yet light enough that I can move it from room to room. The extra cushions make it comfy for any size baby. My daughter is now almost 10 lbs and we just got rid of the tiny cushion a few weeks ago. She did not like to swing until she was about a month old. Now she loves it! I put her in while I take a shower, or prepare dinner, etc. and with all the buckles I know she is safe and happy.The only cons are that it runs on batteries - we would have preferred it to plug in. But it really is pretty reasonable on battery use - we have only changed them once since purchasing and in retrospect I don\'t think they were actually dead, I just didn\'t press the button right. Also, because there is nothing to stop the swing\'s motion even when it is off, it can be hard to put baby in and out especially if she is squirming. Also the sounds and music are kind of tinny and cheap sounding, but baby actually loves it more for that! This swing has been a lifesaver and we are very happy with our purchase. In fact we want a second one for upstairs!",5
"Graco Lovin\' Hug Open Top Swing with Vibration, Betsey",I received this swing as a gift and it worked great for the first week we had it. After the first week the swing just stopped swinging.  I thought it was the batteries but replaced them and tested the old ones and they were fine. My daughter was only 12 pounds so that wasn\'t the problem either. I am now using it as a place for her to nap because I can\'t return it.,1
"Graco Lovin\' Hug Open Top Swing with Vibration, Betsey","Really nice swing, it is really easy to program the swing speeds, the volume, and the sounds. The music sounds a bit distorted, but other than that it is a great buy.",5
"Graco Lovin\' Hug Open Top Swing with Vibration, Betsey",My husband and i saw this piece and i said this is the one.  The price was awesome!  It arrived in about 5 days.  WOW! I like that it has matching pieces to purchase also.  We not only purchased this swing but we also purchased the car seat and the high chair.  Other members of the family purchased the stroller and pack n play.  I would highly recommend this piece.,5
Graco imonitor Vibe,"My son is one and this monitor seems to be dying.  It never worked well in the first place as the battery doesnt stay charged very long (like 3 hours).  But now it keeps cutting out and my house is only 1500 sq feet! Wish I had gotten a better monitor.  I thought this had good reviews in Baby Bargains book, but they were wrong!",1
Graco imonitor Vibe,"Right out of the box, this monitor never worked.  We installed the batteries, allowed the parent unit to charge for more than 24 hours, and it refused to pair with the nursery unit.  Going through the manual pairing process did not help, and in addition the parent unit\'s battery would never get fully charged, even after 48+ hours charging.Hoping this was just a fluke, we returned the monitor and Amazon quickly sent us a replacement.  Unfortunately this unit had exactly the same issues.  At this point I realized that this product is garbage, so I ordered a Phillips monitor that has worked flawlessly from day one.",1
Graco imonitor Vibe,"I purchased this monitor when my granddaughter was born.  I used it about 1-2 times a week and she is less than 1 yr old.  The battery in the monitor died and wouldn\'t recharge.  There was no store around who carried the battery.  The monitor would not work with being plugged in either.  When it did work, it was great.  No interference with other wireless electronics, good sound in a 2 story house, no static noise.  I would not purchase this again.",3
Graco imonitor Vibe,"Purchased this product months ago and wish I had tried it sooner so I could have returned it.  It lasted for all of 2 naps and now the units won\'t stay locked and the charge won\'t keep.  The charger for the baby side of the unit never worked.  The sound, when it worked, was great, but it would have to keep working to be worthwhile!  Total waste of money!",1
Graco imonitor Vibe,"I use baby monitors for an unusual purpose.  My kids are 10, 8, and 7.  I keep one outside when my kids are playing in the back yard, just to make sure that everyone is playing nicely and no one is getting hurt.  It has come in handy on a number of occasions - breaking up fights between my kids and the neighbors, or knowing instantly when someone was starting to do something they shouldn\'t.  It\'s also a great deterrent because the kids know I am listening.The wonderful Fisher Price monitor I bought when my oldest was a baby finally bit the dust after 10 years so I invested in this monitor.  I am taking it back.  The FP had FAR superior reception, far clearer sound, and picked up the kids even from the neighbor\'s yard.  Sometimes I turned it on just to hear the birds chirping outside.Not this one.  The sound quality is grating and harsh.  It cuts in and out as others complained.  And the reception is terrible.  The kids can be 10 feet away talking in a normal voice and I can barely hear them.  It certainly doesn\'t measure up to the basic bare bones FP monitor I bought years ago.",1
Graco imonitor Vibe,"I have had this monitor for 3 months now and I LOVE it! We don\'t have any problems with it interfering with our wireless network or cordless phones. We can hear the smallest peep from our daughter...even when she\'s playing quietly in her crib. The batter has been great too! I can have it on (off the base) for at least 10 hours if not longer. The vibrating feature is perfect for when I\'m in a loud environment (like mowing the lawn, ect). I would suggest this monitor to anyone!",5
Graco imonitor Vibe,This will be short and sweet.Spend a little bit more on something different.Too much background white noise.Looses signal ALL the time.My sons room is right across the hall and we nevercan get a signal.Don\'t waste your money.,1
Graco imonitor Vibe,"We loved this monitor when we first got it. We were sold by the ""trusted"" Graco name and also the digital concept, as we have a small NYC apartment and had heard a lot about interference. But it completely died right around the time our daughter turned 4 months old. At first we thought it was the battery, but it just gave out.Another thing that always annoyed us about it was that the plug for the listening unit (the one in the baby\'s room) popped out really easily. We\'d often be fumbling around, usually in the dark since the baby was sleeping, trying to get the plug back in.Hopefully if and when we have kid #2 another company will have made a great digital monitor...",1
Graco imonitor Vibe,"Haven\'t slept much so I\'ll be brief.  The Graco iMonitor has good range and is simple enough to use.  I liked that it came w/ two receivers.However, it loses reception far too much for no particular reason.  Aside from not being able to hear your newborn for a few seconds at a time, the incessant beeping from the receiver keeps us from sleeping when the baby is.  This monitor may be better than others, as it was highly rated, however, it doesnt perform it\'s most basic function - letting us hear our baby 100% of the time.  Therefore this product is terrible.",1
Graco imonitor Vibe,"Me and my husband were looking for a baby monitor that didn\'t require batteries. We didn\'t want the stress of having to charge them and change them every other day... We found this product and at a reasonable price and bought it! thought we give it a shot. well, my son is going on 3 months now and no problems yet. We can hear every move he makes, even when he passes gas! LOL  We think its a great product! We\'ll let you know if it breaks... so, far so, good!",5
Graco imonitor Vibe,"We have to adjust the channel often. It doesn\'t hold a charge very long. It\'s a little staticy somethimes but not too bad. We live in a small one story house and sometimes the monitor is out of range. We\'ve had it for a year and a half and recently we\'ve had to take out the battery other wise it wont come on, I don\'t know why but it only works when on the charger with to battery pack. Since I already own it and it does kind of work, i\'ll use it, but I wish i didn\'t buy this one.",3
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Barrington","The Britax Boulevard is simply the best purchase that we made last in 2007. Liam was a big baby so carrying around the carrier was not an option when he was a 16-17 lbs at 6 months. After looking at Consumer Reports (# 1 rated car seat), talking with other parents, we decided on the Boulevard.The price was a little hard to swallow, but come on Moms, we would spend the money on a Coach bag or Louis Vuitton. Dads, this is better than a 57 inch TV or PS3. This will take Liam up until he is 65lbs, which is close to 3 years old.Easy to install, even my own mom can install it. Besides, this is your child, don\'t you want the best for them?",5
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Barrington","I just received the Britax Boulvard as a replacement for my Decathalon which was recalled.  Britax has the best customer service.  I called them to explain that it was nearly impossible to tighten the straps on my Decathalon (which I had for almost 3 years) and Britax offered to ship me a new seat of my choice, free of charge.  I chose this seat in the Barrington Pattern and I am so glad that I did.When the seat arrived, I noticed that it seemed a lot more sturdy than the Decathalon.  The fabric was plush and looked so comfortable.  I put my son in it to adjust the straps and he just loved it.The seat was so easy to install and I love the way the latch is positioned on this seat.  You can get the seat so tight in your car that it is as if the seat were a part of the car.My son loved riding in the seat.  He used to cry in the Decathalon, which seemed lower that this seat.  Now, he is higher up and looks much more comfortable.  I love this seat and I love Britax.We also have the Regent for our 2 year old and we love that seat as well.  I highly recommend Britax all around.  If you are debating between this seat and the Decathalon or Marathon, I would say go with this seat - the Decathalon is not of the same quality as this seat and the Marathon does not have the same features.  There is only a slight price difference so I would go with this one.  Also, the pattern on this seat is much nicer in person!",5
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Barrington","We are using the Boulevard in the rear facing mode for our 6 month old son who outgrew his infant carrier.The pros:  Set up was a piece of cake - super super super easy.  The way all the extra parts fit within the seat (under the cover) is well designed. It\'s very plush and soft - and you can remove it to wash.  The straps don\'t need to be rethreaded to move up and down - you just turn the knob.The cons:  The straps get tangled each time I put the baby in and out, even with the rubbery ""hugs"" things.  I think the dark fabric makes it more difficult to see what the straps are doing.  The high profile of the seat in combination with the height of the seat makes it awkward to take the baby in and out since it\'s rear facing (I have to tilt him sideways and have to be super careful not to bonk his head along the way... and by the way, tilting a 22 lb baby is not easy!).  Even with the infant pad removed, there doesn\'t seem to be enough room around the thighs - it\'s a tight fit.I think forward facing with this will be much better.",4
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Barrington","I didn\'t realize how BIG this carseat was until we installed it. My daughter is 21 months old and is only about 22 pounds so this should last us forever. If you have a small car you might be better off with the Marathon or the Roundabout. I chose this for the side impact and the look of the seat. I certainly feel safer with her in this than in some of the other brands. And it is nice and high so she can see what\'s going on and LOVES her ""new carseat"" The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that if you have a small car or will be transferring it between 2 cars it might be a bit bulky.",4
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Granite","I found this very easy to install (rear facing).  Our 9 month old loves it especially how she can sit up more and look around.  She seems very comfortsble and the straps are easy to adjust.  I do think the straps could be tight around her thighs if she keeps growing at this rate, but so far so good.",4
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Granite","After recent car seat buying nightmares I thought I should come and write a review for the Roundabout in case anyone runs into the same issues we had. I got this carseat before my son was born and it has worked faithfully for us until he turned 20 months. The seat is wonderful and I really have no complaints about it.What we have run into now however is my son has outgrown it early (he is taller then most) and he is unable to move into a full on booster such as the Turbobooster because of age and size..he has to use one of the transitional boosters like an Evenflo Generations etc. So what I might recommend to parents looking into car seats is that you go with the other convertible Britax (Marathon?) because the weight limit is higher and you can use it longer then the Roundabout or you might look into a seat like the Britax Regence that grows with the child (up to 100 pds) so you dont have to buy many car seats over the first 2-3 years and spend a ton of money. We already spent $250 on the Roundabout and we are now possibly looking at an additional $250 for yet another car seat. Had I known I wouldve tried for a seat that I couldve used longer.That being said, if you really like the look of the Roundabout I loved it. Easy to install and/or move between cars. I always felt my son was safe in it",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"We\'ve had this for a few months now and already had to order two replacement toys. The spinners no longer make sounds and my daughter can pull the book right off. This is described as ""rocking,"" but that means an active child (like my 8-month-old) can rock it right off its stand. She can\'t tip it over, but she can move it all over the place.That said, she does love playing in it for about 20 minute stretches. She especially loves the animal sound/ music box. She enjoys being able to move herself around and rediscovering each new toy. Standing up in it has made her legs and upper body stronger, too.The concept of these activity centers/ ""exersaucers"" is great, but they need to have extremely sturdy construction. This one doesn\'t have it.",3
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,Love this item. My first grandaughter used this until she could walk we bought another one for our second grandaughter.,5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"I thought it was easy to put together, I don\' like that I did have to use a screw driver for 3 of the items. The other hard part was the putting on the cloth it was hard for my big had to get to the last hole.My baby loves it and was crazy about all the stuff on it. I like that it has three height levels. It\'s not heavy and easy to move from room to room.",4
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"We purchased this product on our granddaughter\'s 5 month birthday and it was an instant hit.  Assembly was quick and easy.  She is a big baby and fits well on the lowest setting and is able to turn with ease.  She plays with and enjoys all of the elements, even the dragon that some reviews indicate is scary.  The book is a little frustrating for her because the pages with different animal pictures are difficult to turn. We looked at the exersaucers but preferred the construction and features of the Baby Einstein. It has been in use for 4 weeks now and we feel this was the right decision.",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"This thing is great, I bought it for my granddaughter.  We didn\'t have stuff like this 30 years ago, when my daughter was a baby.  I put her in it when she was 3 months old, and she liked it from the very beginning.  It has been about 3 weeks and she is slowly mastering all the toys.  I put it together myself, it only requires a screwdriver and that is only for 3 screws.  It took me about 20 minutes.  I love it, it gives me a safe, entertaining place for her to be if I need to run to the restroom or dart off into the kitchen for a bit.",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"I actually have used this for almost 3 years - and I mean used it!  My now three year old twins, and then their 1 year old baby sister have all spent many hours playing with it.  With the twins one would sit inside and then one would hold on to the outside and play.  I purchased an activity center at the recommendation of a physical therapist to help my lagging twin develop more core strength and it seemed to help.  He was relatively supported sitting and enjoyed his time much more with so much to do.  I did use a blanket around him at first but he soon didn\'t need that extra support.  I even use the toy outside when I don\'t want my one year old crawling around if I\'m distracted (like cleaning a car or weeding.  Wonderful investment!  Seat cleans well, all toys still in good condition, music/sounds NOT annoying, batteries last long.",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"We love this. My friend had the red one (I hated the colors) so we thought we\'d get this one. The toned down colors are very nice and fit in with our house much better. The reason for the 4 stars and the Arrrgh title is that the toys can come off easy (not a choking hazard) and it is EXTREMELY hard to get them back on, if at all. I am sure it is a problem with most exosaucers though.",4
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"This is a nice activity center and yes my baby is happy to play with it and I am glad to have it. BUT for the amount of money I think the construction is poor; she has already pulled out the sunshine and block tower, the round animal noise maker doesn\'t sit properly so it moves/spoken words are not clear, we have replaced the globe because it became detached from it\'s stand and as others have said the ""stands"" to keep it from rocking wear out. She can pop two of them out which creates a crooked/lopsided rocking for her. I don\'t think it\'s worth the money, Graco needs to spend more time on the construction of it\'s products and not rely soley on name fame.",3
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"I bought this for my future grandson who is due in April, 2008.  I trust anything by Baby Einstein as I have another grandson who has several toys from Baby Einstein.  This discover and play is very colorful and I am sure it will come in handy so that my daughter-in-law knows where by grandson is at all times.",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"We bought this for our baby, who\'s now 6 months old and 19 pounds.  He plays in it, but not for that long, so we thought it was him.  Upon visiting friends who had an evenflo exersaucer, he played in that for almost an hour, having much more fun than in this.  This one doesn\'t bounce at all, and that\'s his favorite part of the other one.  The activities on this are pretty limited. I\'m really sorry we got this one, and would recommend people getting one that bounces.",3
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"This is my first review online ever and thought I should start. I have based all of my purchase decisions for my new baby boy on reviews and once again this ""technique"" has not failed on me. This activity center is GREAT. I was a little concerned my little one would be too small and not ready for this. However, since he can hold his head up, I thought I may give it a try. Well, we put him in last night (had to put some blankets around him due to his small size) and the sun caught his attention immediately. My husband then started flicking it and suddenly, my little one started laughing so hard. This is the first time he has actually laughed this hard. To make the long story short, my baby played in there for about an hour last evening and slept real good last night. I guess he had fun!",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"Baby is now 7 mos old and continues to love this activity center.  We got it when he was 6 mos old and he was a little short even on the lowest height setting.  We had a 2 inch piece of foam and put it under his feet and he was so happy to practice standing and play with primarily the sun-face.  Now 1 month later he doesn\'t need the foam to stand up and touch the bottom.  He also stands in it for a long time squealing and laughing while spinning the circles and hitting the barnyard animal noise maker.  Love it, love it, love it.  He also can turn the seat 360 now to follow anyone who enters the room.",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"This was my son\'s Christmas present (he was 3 months at the time). And he loves it! His favorite was the Sun face, but as he has grown, he enjoys each of the toys, with the exception of the dragon-like puppet.We have not had any problems with the toys coming off, and our son bends and pulls them to his mouth. The seat snaps on and off and is machine washable. Overall, a great play center.",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"I love this product!!! As soon as my daughter sat in it she just lights up! It is well constructed, has great toys, and the colors are great.",5
Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"My son at 4.5 months was above average for weight and height and he wanted to move.  We purchased this excer-saucer as it allows more weight and height than most of the similar items.  He LOVES this ""toy"".  He will sit/stand in it for 30-60 minutes at a time.  He loves to make it rock.  He laughs at it/with it.  Rocks when the tunes play and enjoys eacho of the play items.  Amazingly enough, what appears to be the simplest of items on the activity center (the orange smiley star on a blue circle) is his favorite thing.  It\'s like a huge lollipop he likes to bend it and teethe on it.  This is a colorful, highly engaging, educational item.  It allows you to have your hands free for a bit to do some laundry, dishes, or take a shower-- and know your child is safe and having a great time.  We highly recommend this!  Amazon had the best price, and free shipping, on this when we purchased it.  Fan-tab-ulous!!!!!",5

Peg Perego Uno Convertible Carriage to Stroller System in Moka,"I have this stroller for about a week now and it is perfect. It rides smoothly, and it has a lot of features. The color is very nice. It\'s good for a girl or a boy.",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"I LOVE IT -- the perfect combination of lightweight + recliningit is light -- easy to fold and open -- the one hand open and close option works very well (after you \'figure it out\').  very durable -- we have taken it on 5-6 trips -- it has been (man)-handled by the baggage handlers at many different airports (in the US and in a few South American countries)the reclining is more than enough to get my baby to sleep comfortably --- the hood is a little small (especially when the seat is reclined), so we used a jacket or blanked to provide additional shade while she was sleeping.it is easy to maneuver in small spaces and on all sorts of surfacesfits easily in a regular sedan trunk",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"Researched a tested dozens of strollers before taking the plunge on the Aria. Got my Aria when baby was 3 months old, a year ago now. This stroller has been perfect! It reclines almost all of the way so a young baby can be in it and great now for when she falls asleep. It\'s intuitive design has been great. It was between this and the Maclaren and I don\'t regret the decision at all. This one has one-handed steering, it reclines much easier and it folds with one hand (important when your baby is in the other!). It also doesn\'t tip when you have the diaper bag on the handles and no baby in it. My friend\'s Maclarens tip. The fabric does not clean particularly well (but with a toddler, I\'ve given up on some of that or you lose your mind!). Have put many miles on this stroller, use it everyday in New York City (no car so stroller takes extra abuse) and it\'s held up no problem!",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"My baby is 16 months old and I have been extremely happy with this stroller (I have the green bubbles color).  It is sooo lightweight - only about 9 pounds.  I don\'t think there is another full size stroller out there this easy to lift.  You truly can pop it open with one hand.  Another thing I love about it is the back can be positioned so the baby is sitting up straight and you can recline the back to any position you want (except flat - full recline).  I have heard mothers complain that their strollers (often expensive brands) have only a few recline positions and the back cannot be positioned straight upright.  The option of a three or five point seat belt is also great as is the freedom of movement ability which my baby loves. The only negative is the latch that prevents freedom of movement often comes undone. This does not affect the safety though since the five point harness remains on the baby.  Also the parent cup holder does not stay on well but I bought an attachable one that works better.  All in all, this is the best stroller out there in my opinion.  Many people have stopped me on the street asking where I got it.",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"This stroller is exactly what I wanted!  It is lightweight, compact and easy to use.  We travel in the van alot and need to have our trunk area for packing.  This stroller takes up about 1/4 of the space in the trunk where our old stroller took up close to 1/2.  An added bonus is that our Graco car seat sits fairly securely, but does not latch.  We only use it together on very even flooring.  The only complaint I have regarding this stroller is that the cup holder spins making a spill of my drink very likely.  Since this is a minor inconvenience, I still rate this product 5 stars.",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"We have 3 strollers...one for when my son was an infant, another that\'s the ""cadillac"" of strollers and then the Aria.We initially got this because we were travelling abroad and didn\'t want to take our 19lb stroller with us (partially because I would be by myself for some of the trip with our infant son). Convinced we had to have this one, we ordered it. Unfortunately, our son was too small for it (18lbs) and wasn\'t really sitting up right on his own, so we took the Cadillac with us. Since then, we have let our friends and family borrow this for their trips, everyone has been excited and loves it. Compliments on the ease of steering, even with a full load, baby, diaper bag, shopping, knick knacks in the basket. One hand open and close. It\'s very easy to use!KEEP IN MIND: this stroller will not be ready for your baby if they are not sitting up on their own. The back is flimsy and not as firm/sturdy as most full size stroller. I didn\'t feel like it supported him enough to use it until he was upright on his own. He would flop around from side to side (even harnessed in). The plus side is that there is plenty of room for your baby to grow and use it well into toddler years.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT...light (9lbs), very easy to steer with 1 hand, open/close with 1 hand, inexpensive. It has all the functionalities of a more expensive stroller. Ours came fully loaded with the foot muff (great for cold days) and a rain cover (it doesn\'t rain much here so that\'s useless). It takes up virtually no space when folded up. Very small for the size of the stroller.DISLIKE: I like our PP Switch because we could have our baby facing us or out very easily...I like looking at him, although I think he\'s outgrown that phase and likes to look out and see things/people. There isn\'t a LARGE cup holder. The one that it comes with is great for a baby bottle, not so much for an adult water bottle. I think it\'s a little ""low"", if the handles extended I think it would be great for average height folks. (I\'m 5\'3"" - so it works for me). The transition from ""sitting up"" to ""laying down"" is jerky and has woken up our baby. It\'s nice that it has that function for the size/price point of this stroller. Not in love with it (smoother in the Switch).Overall - Definitely recommend it. It\'s inexpensive and has a lot of the functions/comfort of a regular full size stroller, without the weight.UPDATE: It\'s been 2 years since we\'ve had this - and when my son was able to sit up on his own, we switched to this stroller and haven\'t changes since. I did spent the last month+ looking for an even lighter stroller that had all the benefits of this one.Like - the maneuverability with just 1 hand is insanely easy in a mall or smooth surfaces. On a brick walkway - it takes a little bit of pressure but totally manageable. This thing unfolds with a release of a button - very easy! It\'s thin when folded up - also a bonus.Dislikes: The cup holder that comes with the stroller SUCK! it cracks easiy and gets mishappen (found that out when we got our stroller back from gate check after a flight) - you can\'t access the storage basket easily when your baby is in full recline mode - wish the back had a sturdier support.I have searched on all sorts of websites and have had NO success in finding a lightweight stroller that offers the SAME use as a full size. I\'m so happy with this. I did purchase a few extras to add on storage and a better cup holder.Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy and the Carry You Saddle bag. I hung the saddlebag on the diaper bag hook (there\'s a little hook on the stroller for the Peg Perego Diaper Bag - don\'t get their diaper bag, it\'s small and totally just for aesthetics) - anyways, I used the velcro on the saddle bag to hook it and now I have easy access to diapers/wipes and binkies. The Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy is awesome b/c it all collapses with the stroller - it\'s the sturdiest cup holder I\'ve found that works with this stroller.",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"the seller Happymother\'s inconvenienced me greatly when they never alerted me to the fact that they over sold the item...so it didn\'t come in the estimated time (as they were out of stock.)While the price was good, the stroller looks nice, and is light weight there are 2 major design flaws with this stroller...1. the seat is set too low, and my child\'s feet are able to get caught in the front wheels.2. the breaks stick out from the back wheels making it impossible for me to get the stroller up stairs by walking backwards and backing it up (as i did with my metrolite greco stroller) so i have to actually pick it up and struggle with it to get it up my front stoop, or any other stairs i encounter on my daily walks.i like the snack tray, the under-storage, and the more narrow width, but being unable to back up stairs, and my child\'s feet getting caught in the wheels are a bit of a deal breaker! also the seat belt is a confusing mess of straps and hooks. the metrolite seat belt system was much better.",2

"Peg-Perego 2011 Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat,  Paloma","Really i have no idea what all these other people are talking about! I have gone above and beyond trying to find the safest and best brands of car seats that also will last for a while. This car seat came highly recommended from other mother and got TOP PICK for crash tests! HELLO must i say any more?a little about the seat. the lock in base that is normally plastic on most car seats is metal meaning its very unlikely for this seat to fail in the even of an accident. It is true that the seat itself weighs a little more than most but its bc this seat is made better. It also has a one hand release button on the back that releases it from the base.  Now this is my first child going into the car seat so i dont have to much to compare it to myself but my mother in law, sister in law and other moms that have used many other kinds and brands all say that they would pick mine if they could do it again. I dont know about the rest of you but my child is worth the extra weight if i know she\'s going to be safe!",5

"Peg-Perego 2011 Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat,  Paloma","This seat is fine overall, a bit heavy which was to be expected from the specs, but what I didn\'t really expect was how bad the sun shade would be.  This car seat is one of the most expensive infant car seats on the market, and for the price you would think that Peg would have figured out how to engineer a good shade.  This barely shades my baby  and you can\'t carry the seat with the shade up unless you jam your arm underneath it.  The shade is awful.  If I had to do it again I would buy another seat that isn\'t as heavy and has a better shade, AND is less expensive.  From talking with car seat experts all seats have to meet the same specs through the NHTSA so the Peg SIP system has no standard and therefore doesn\'t really mean very much.",3

Even worse during winter when you have to almost run from the car to the nearest door with this EXTRA heavy seat. My husband says is sturdy and well made, and I don\'t doubt it but the best car seat is the one you can easily use and this is literally a pain in the back.",3
"Peg-Perego 2011 Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat,  Paloma","I do not recommend purchasing this car seat. I purchased it to snap into my Peg Perego pliko (which I love) but all it has caused me is daily frustration. It is so heavy, I cannot use it as a travel system. The seat belt is difficult to maneuver and adjust. Save your money and purchase a car seat that is easier to use. I\'ve had enough and am switching over to a convertible carseat (Britax) before baby even turns one.Cons:* Straps constantly get twisted and are difficult to fix* Straps get stuck and cannot make tighter with adjustment* Seatbelt is a 3-piece puzzle!!, which is difficult to put together (cloth piece often gets in the way of closing seat belt)* Cannot get rid of oversized cloth piece to make seatbelt easier to snap in, or baby may get skin pinched.* It is very heavy!Pros:* Snaps into peg perego stroller.* Nice looking",1

When I use the infant seat she can fit on the smaller side and when I take our little one out to look around I have the older one ride on the bigger side.  They both laugh and giggle in it.  It is extremely easy to push and the fact that it will fit through a single door is great.  Some store isles are small, but even my smaller stroller would have problems.  The only con I\'ve found is the storage bag underneath is hard to get things in and out of and sometimes I feel I have to crawl on the floor, but to me that\'s nothing for the ease of folding it and the lightweight, especially for a double stroller.  If I had to do it all over again I would buy this without a second thought.",5
Peg Perego Aria Twin Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"I debated between this double and Joovy Ultralight when I had my second daughter 9 mos ago. I chose the double Peg because I wasn\'t sure that my 2 year old would be comfortable in the Joovy. Of course my toddler has zero interest in sitting in the stroller so ultimately I had to buy the Joovy anyway - which she loves.The ONLY things that I like about this stroller are #1 the weight - it is extremely light, and easy to push.  #2 it is more narrow then  most side by sides due to the 60/40 seat configuation  - I have had no problems fitting through doorways.Problems...  #1 The biggest problem I have had has been opening the stroller from it\'s folded position. It gets stuck 90% of the time and is very difficult to open.  #2 Doesn\'t fold easily - definitly cannot be folded \'one-handed\' as advertised. #3 No parent storage, the flimsy cup holder falls off every time it\'s folded.Reccomendation:  Good stroller if you actually have twins (as long as you don\'t plan to use with both car seats as smaller seat will not accomidate a car seat), however  if you have a toddler, go with the Joovy.",3
Peg Perego Aria Twin Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"Please keep shopping, this stroller is a huge disappointment.  If you dare to come to a stop or need to turn a corner the frame locks up & the wheels will not move.  If you are rolling along in a straight line on a perfectly smooth surface it is ok but real world use it is awful. I really thought this stroller was really going to be great for our twins, it is lightweight, easy to collapse & has a huge basket.  But the frame just cannot handle the combined 50# (yes, only 50#) weight of my twins.",1
Peg Perego Uno Convertible Carriage to Stroller System in Bubbles Green,"Peg Perego products are well thought-out in terms of asthetics and function. The particular model I bought for my expectant daughter-in-law is green and grey, suitable for either sex. I was pleased that my daughter-in-law loves it so much. I especially like the versatility-it does everything but the dishes!",5
Sumersault Moo Cow Rug,Purchased for my future granddaughter\'s room.  The rug looks great in front of the crib.  My son and daughter-in-law love it.,5
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,We ordered these sheets thinking they would be soft flannel as per the picture. The reality is that they appear thin and almost threadbare. I returned them.,2
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,"I have tried many different brands of crib sheets trying to find ones that were soft, yet durable, and these finally were it! The seems have held up after many washings, they didn\'t shrink, or fade, and they have stayed super soft like the first time we used them. We\'ve completely given up buying sheets from walmart or target, and even some brands sold here are not worth the money. Thankful we have found these!",5
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,This has proven to be one of the softest flannel sheets for a crib mattress that we\'ve found. Our daughter sleeps really great with these on her mattress. A must purchase!,4
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,I washed these sheets immediately upon receiving them and think they 1) wash and dry well (no problems with lint as of yet) and 2) provide a nice and snug fit when on the crib mattress (a colgate organic foam mattress). They feel incredibly cozy and soft and I think make the crib a bit warmer. Exactly what I was looking for!,5
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,"I bought these exact sheets two years ago and they\'ve been fantastic. Still thick and cozy after many, many washes! Was extremely disappointed to find the level of quality has dropped tremendously. I returned these immediately after opening - thin, not at all soft, weird smell. Save your money!",1
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,"I\'m not sure what has happened to the latest shipments of these sheets, but the seller needs to check the entire batch in their warehouse before shipping these out. They smell like they have been SPRAYED with something horrendous! I thought it was the plastic packaging at first, but I peeled back the plastic to check the sheets themselves- touch for softness & a sniff test. The odor threw me for a loop. I literally nearly vomited, and my lungs got irritated (asthmatic)! Whatever is causing the odor attached to my fingers from feeling the fabric, so they smelled like the sheets too (hands washed immediately)! I have never experienced anything like this. SELLER- PLEASE CHECK THE REST OF YOUR STOCK. SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THESE SHEETS!! These are supposed to be organic cotton, which means they should be pesticide free & with no chemical finishes. Were they sprayed with something prior to being shipped from the manufacturer, or was there a chemical spill in the same cargo unit or something? THESE ARE NOT FIT FOR A BABY\'S CRIB. My purchase is already being returned! Unfortunately, this experience has put me off of Tadpoles branded items!",1
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,flannel is thick and very warm.  Nice for cold climates!One is on my daughter\'s toddler bed and the other is onmy 3 mos old\'s bed.,5
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,"These sheets are amazing! My boys\' mattresses are different thicknesses and these are a nice, thick flannel that fit both mattresses very well. As with all new flannel, you need to wash them by themselves first to prevent pilling but after 3 months of continuous use and weekly (or more) washings, they are still very thick, warm and soft.",5
Tadpoles Organics Set of 2 Brushed Cotton Fitted Crib Sheets - White,"These are great, soft, unbleached and wash well.  My baby and I love them.  They smelled a bit when they cam out of the package but this washed away.",5

"Tadpoles Organics Set of 3 Flannel Receiving Blankets, White","I really like it. It is so soft, and kept my son a premie so warm in cozy in the winter. Was a great blanket for swaddling.",5
"Tadpoles Organics Set of 3 Flannel Receiving Blankets, White","Very soft, big enough to swaddle a newborn. Thicker and softer than the standard receiving blankets out there. My only complaint is that the edges tend to wrinkle in the wash, and I am not really up for ironing baby blankets.",4
"Kids Line Julia Valance, Pink/Maroon","picked these to match a quilt purchased at a local store, it look really good, it matched the other items in the room, and were easy to maintain in wash/dry cycles",4
"Kids Line Julia 6 Piece Crib Set, Pink/Maroon",I was lucky to grab the last set I could find anywhere since it was discontinued. So thankful to have it.,5
LEGO Batman Connect and Build Pen,"It\'s ok...he loved it when he opened it but once the novelty wears off like most ""have to haves"" it\'s just sits in his room.Maybe later when he starts using a pen more often rather than pencils and markers, he\'ll enjoy it a little more so it may be more for kids older than 8 and starting to write with pens.",3
"Luv N Care 3 Stage 7oz Nuby No-Spill Bottle, Pink-Purple",love Nuby products. Comes with a regular nipple and a sippy nipple for older babies. My 10 month old loves it. Helps her get used to the transition to an actual sippy cup.,5
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","Excellent product. When my 5month old baby boy got hold of it, he spent the whole dinner time wolfing pumping pieces from this mesh. It was his first real solid food treat. We couldn\'t tell who was having a better time - him, or all the adults sitting at the table.",4
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","Place some fresh fruit like melon, strawberries etc.. and place it in the freezer and baby loved it plus you know it\'s real fruit.",5
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","My son absolutely loves these mesh feeders. He\'s 6 months old. We\'ve only used bananas in them so far, but they have been awesome. It keeps him entertained for a good chunk of time. The only draw back is that once there is just a little bit left in the mesh net, he can\'t always get the part with food in his mouth by himself. I think that would happen with any other brand as well.",5
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary",Helps with teething but a little hard to hold. I think a ring base would be better. Mesh liner pops out for easy cleaning.,3
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","These are a sturdy, well-made product...but they are a real pain to open and close!  Maybe it\'s just me, but I kept struggling to open them.  Cleaning is a pain.  Both of my kids always seemed to hold the mesh end and chew on the handles, so they were super messy.  Just wait until baby\'s old enough and can eat finger foods or purees...this was a waste of money.",3
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary",I bought this for my 6 month old daughter and put frozen mangos in it...she grubbed down on it!  What an awesome way to give your babies fruit!  I don\'t worry about her choking either since the leftover pieces don\'t come thru the mesh.  I\'m buying more!  I only wish they put extra mesh in the package.,5
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary",Great product and received it so quickly. The product is perfect for my 8 month old baby.,5
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","My 4 month old son has been teething like crazy, but does not like the standard teething rings. Finding something that he can chew on that is safe, and appealing has been a challenge - however, this product has solved my problem! I can put frozen fruit such as bananas or peaches in it, without having to worry about him choking or getting it all over his hands. This allows the soothing coolness and the taste of the fruit at the same time. Compared to other brands or in store deals, the price was great. I\'ve already recommended this product to several of my other mommy friends. (:",4
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","We\'ve used Munchkin feeders in the past, and loved them. This feeder has a removable mesh, which is a great plus for me, as I don\'t have to throw away the whole thing when the mesh gets too dirty.My baby seems to like it, and gladly eats fruits out of it.It is a little hard to open and close, though. That\'s why I gave it 4 starts instead of all 5.",4
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","My little one liked this product, but it ended up being so messy for Momma.  The handle is a nice size so that a child can easily grasp this while eating. The mesh is a pain to clean and I ended up having to soak it to get all the food from out of the holes and the lip of where you put in the food. If your looking for a product that will get your baby to try more fruits that this is a great item for you.  If you get annoyed at having to put some elbow grease into cleaning a baby product then pass on this.",3
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary",Tried may versions of this type of product and like this one the best.  I like that the mesh is replaceable and that it all comes apart so easily. The mesh is also easy to gum - not very abrasive. These are all a little hard to clean - things seem to get gummed up in the mesh part. But of them all this one is the easiest. Baby loves it!,5
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary",I put a piece of fruit inside and I can give it to my son and forget about it.. I know he won\'t choke on it... And he is having real fruit and process it.,5
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","I love the idea of these, but my little guy is not into them at all. To be fair, he\'s not into any food right now (he\'s 8 months old). I was hoping this would be a good way to get him to eat some food, but he\'s still not having it. I am optimistic that he\'ll come around to it eventually, though. I have no complaints with the product itself.",4
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","I bought this elsewhere for my son, but they were so hard to open that I threw it all in the garbage !",1
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","Good price for starter set, will definitely be ordering more. The foam is very cushy and the pieces are bright and easy to play with.",5
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","I bougth this product for my 6 months daugther who is starting to crawl. I put this on the floor and she didn\'t get hurt.I had another brand and they are thiner than this ones. This are perfect, very colorful, and the shapes are cute. My kid love to crawl in this.",5
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set",I bought this with the 26 pieces letter ones for my 10 month old. They look really cute but the little pieces tend to fall off if pressed (I put them on the carpet). I have to put them at places where baby do not usually go. If you have carpet I would recommend the letters and numbers.,3
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","What could be nicer, a puzzle for the little ones, and something for them to play on, and easy to clean up afterward. Wish my whole room had these such tiles !",5
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","The puzzles came exactly as described. are bright, attention grabbing, and durable for foam. I recommend them 90%  (the lack of 10% just as a caution because some of the pieces are obviously small.",5
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","I compared many different playmats for our hardwood floors and picked this one because I really loved the design.  It is very cute and looks great.  However, the removable puzzle pieces have some really small pieces that are dangerous.  I hated to, but had to throw it out.",2
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","I really loved these foam mats right out of the bag.. setting them up for my 2 year old daughter, I knew she was going to love them! She squealed with excitement when she saw them and laid down on them and began to play. They are very bright and colorful and are a great addition to her playroom. Sturdy but soft to cushion a fall. They will clean up really easily. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is this: I knew the little shapes in the middle would be able to be removed, and of course that\'s the very first thing my daughter wanted to do. What I did NOT know was that those shapes themselves come apart in a million different little pieces!!! SO annoying because every time my daughter plays now she takes apart all the tons of pieces and I am the one who has to put them back together... well boy did I feel like a moron when I sat there for 20 minutes trying to put them back together! Some of them are very oddly shaped and it was impossible to figure out where they went... I wish the shapes came up in one piece instead of 5+ pieces per shape. That makes at least 50 pieces of foam mat to keep up with!",4
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set",Great product but my 10 month old figured out how to take the mats apart in about 1 day and some of the pieces I worry she might choke on.,4
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","Very nice soft base for setting up a play area indoors and outside. Firm enough to provide stability for walking, but soft enough to provide a little cushioning for minors trips and falls.",5
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set",I purchased these foam puzzle mats because they were the only mats that didn\'t publish a choking hazard warning.  I was very disappointed when we received them.  Both Target and Walmart offer less expensive alternatives.  Don\'t waste your on money on these.,1
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set",We used these tiles along with more of the Edushape tiles to cover the floor in our daughter\'s playroom.  They fit together well and look great.  They are fairly soft.  Our daughter has started pulling up and fallen a couple of times on these with no significant crying fits.,5
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set",Many of the foam pieces easily fit into a baby or toddler\'s mouth. Some of the pieces are about the size of 2 quarters. It\'s really unbelieveably poorly designed. Kids love to chew on this type of foam and it is hard to think of anything easier to choke on than something that squishes down and then expands. I pulled a piece out of my toddler\'s mouth and then quickly realized the danger. I gathered up the dozen or so small pieces and removed them from the puzzle. Beware!,1
"Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set","I was given this for my newborn on hardwood floors; bad idea. I don\'t remember toxic smell, but many of the pieces are choking hazards. Otherwise it is what you\'d expect. Perfect puzzle for older babies who no longer put things in their mouths.",3
Edushape Adventure Road Mat - W / Sound,Fun for the kids but still expensive for what you get.The patches that protect the little sound boxes underneath come off easily - we need to glue them.,3

"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny","This is a great little ""blanket"" for our son.  He loves to chew on the ears...and likes to feel the different textures.I love the coloring so if he spits up on it, it doesn\'t stand out horribly! : )It has made it through the wash many times with no issues--very durable.Plus, it is super cute and different!  We love it",5
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny",I love these toys! They are fun and just a little bit different!,5
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny","love the design, great quality, full of different textures for baby, can be machine washed, fun little doudou ;)",5
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny","I like this toy, it is the biggest of this brand and of the ""blanket"" toys they make.  But, my baby doesn\'t love it as much as the small rat toy I got him from the same company.  He does like to suck on the nose of this toy too.  I guess this is supposed to be a small blanket corner with a head on it, but it just seems hallow like it needs some stuffing.  It\'s soft and I like the fabric, but it doesn\'t get loved very much by my baby, but it is a safe and soft toy to throw in the play pen with him.  Oh, and it was really expensive, so I took one more star off for that.  $20 for a baby toy is a lot in my book.",3
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny","This is a tough one to rate because it wasn\'t what I expected.  It seems rather expensive for the product I received.  I bought it for my 2-month old grandson and his mother liked it.  If I had seen it in a store, however, I would not have purchased it.",3
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny","I bought the Lapinos version of this toy before my daughter was born. Shortly after she was born she started cuddling with it and now she absolutely has to have it to go to sleep at night! The poor toy has been washed, sucked on, spit up on, and much more and still looks and feels great! I highly recommend him for anyone looking for a great bedtime cuddle toy for their baby!",5
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny",I was so surprised at how cute and well made this product is! Just so adorable! I definitely recommend this!,5
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny","Very adorable, unique, and softer than you could imagine.  Perfect baby gift!  Only Issue: The term ""blankie"" is deceiving, as it is small, and looks more like a deflated stuffed animal, not ""blankie"" size.  Highly recommend this purchase.",4
Blabla Bubbles Doll,"My son, Logan, loves the blabla animals.  He had Mozart the monkey since birth and grew so attached that now at 9 months old we\'ve added Adiamo the dog to the collection.  When I check up on my sleeping boy he is always snuggled tightly to one of these toys.  They wash well and are a true special toy that I hope to give to other friends having babies.  We also like the blabla hats :-)  So cute!",5
Blabla Bubbles Doll,This definitely is a cat that is sure to bring a smile to your child\'s face.  BlaBla is so perfectly made and of quality products.  I was so pleased with this product I am looking to buy more!!!,5
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown","Worst chair ever! Looks great, but does not fold as flat as should.  Legs flair out and everyone trips on them, everyday!  Hard to clean. Cloth straps absorb food.  Overly complicated.  Any chair but this one!",1
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown","I bought the Nano because I thought it was a gorgeous highchair, especially for the price.  Clean lines, no cartoon characters and compact for storage--what could be better?  For starters a chair that you can actually clean.  The leg strap is padded and bulky, catches all sorts of food in the velcro and is sewn to the seat so you can\'t get to all of the gunk inside and around the edges.  The strap pads don\'t detach and they too are filthy despite being cleaned after every use.  And the model American customers will receive has a huge plastic lump where you see a lovely thin bar in the photos.  All in all this chair has been a massive disappointment.  I am not going to toss the chair out just yet (it is functional after all) but once my first is sitting at the table this will be sitting in the trash.",1
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown","HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDLove everything about this chair. No idea why other rated it poorly since this chair is absolutely as described: looks fantastic, sturdy, cleans easily, and folds down to really thin (this is the most important part for us since we live in a small space).",5
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown","Good chair. Love that it folds up. Easy to put together. Cute color. Only complaint is that when food gets in crevices, or on stitching, it can be hard to clean.",4
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown",This highchair is wonderful!! My daughter has been using it since she was 4 months old. The style makes it easy for young babys to sit and enjoy mealtime before they actually start eating solids. The leather is super easy to clean. The base is very sturdy and strong. There is no wobbling at all! We have two dogs and I love knowing that even if the chair gets bumped its still going to stand strong. The third thing I absolutely love is that the tray is so wide. She has a lot of space to play and eat. The way it is set up makes it easy for the food to stay on the tray and not reach the floor. Wonderful wonderful product!! I highly recommend.,5
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown","I hate to do this but.... do not buy this chair! We got it and have been so disappointed in it - it just isn\'t designed for practical use - the main problem is that the seat back is in no way supportive at all and in fact babies of all ages can only slouch in it. Its not just our son (who has been using it from 5 months to 8 month) but we tested it out on older infants too and got the same problem. I have still been using it whilst waiting for our new chair but our nanny refuses to - she has worked in the industry many years and says she has never seen such a useless chair!It looks ok in real life - though I thought the white color was more cream than anything, and of course it folds down to very slim - but what is the point in having a chair that encourages bad posture - honestly its very difficult for them to pull them selves forward to the table - Oh and another thing the table slants towards the seat so things don\'t sit on it straight - why sell something based on being a modern design if it just doesn\'t work - I can not wait to get anything else but this",1
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown","I am not a review person but I really feel the need to review this product. Especially today, after I stubbed my toe again on it\'s base. My mother in law broke her toe on it. The legs slant out slightly, so if you are walking towards the chair its placement is deceiving if you are not looking down. This chair is HORRIBLE to clean. I did call and ask for a new cover since mine smelled disgusting. I had to throw it away within a few months of use. I cleaned it after ever use.",1
"Nature BabyCare Eco-friendly, Chlorine Free Diapers, Size 2 (12-18 Lbs), 160 Diapers","I tried these twice after my displeasure with Seventh Generation\'s change to their tabs hoping for a better diaper and was sorely disappointed.""Velcro Tabs""The tabs are very small and do not hold well, and if you have to readjust them for any reason be wary- they rarely hold after a second adjustment and have hardly any velcro on them.""Fit""The diapers are on the small side.  I ordered these again by accident and figured I\'d try using them again since I\'d already paid for them but my son is 18lbs and in the 18lb diaper I could barely close the fastening tabs.  The elastic around his legs and bottom were insufficient and when he pooped it went all over my lap- leaving almost nothing in his diaper. The 7th Generation diapers although they are approximately the same size have never done this.  I had multiple leaks before his diaper was even partially full.""Comfort""I used them when my son was younger and found them to be very stiff and caused lots of redness to my sons gentler parts.""Absorbancy""These are significantly less absorbent than any other diaper I have tried (I compared it to my Seventh Generation diapers of the same size using a measuring cup and found that after 3/4 cups water they leaked while the 7th Gen was still going strong).  Does not absorb poop- even the liquid kind (so if you don\'t change your child immediately he\'s sitting in it unless your child moves and it squishes out - one of the many possible exits - which has happened with my son far too much).Overall I recommend Seventh Generation if you\'re looking for an environmentally sound diaper that still functions - I will NEVER use this diaper again.",1
"Nature Babycare Eco-friendly, Chlorine Free Diapers, Size 4 (22-37 Lbs), 120 Diapers",I think these diapers are fabulous! I think these are wonderful and make me feel much better about what I am doing to the earth.  I read that in a average year a child goes through half a ton of diapers and we all know that they are not going to be reabsorbed into the earth in our lifetime.  Cloth is for people way more dedicated to the cause (and less squimish) than me.  Buy them when you can they go fast especially in the bigger sizes.  Wish they made them as a pull up as well.,5

"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I really love this little walker. It\'s cute and sturdy. It collapses flat for storage and you can remove the activity tray. The music and lights are fun and entertaining and the height is adjustable. Our little guy loves it! :),5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My mother in law bought this walker for my daughter when she was 9 months old. She is now almost 4 and it is still being used by my second child (11 months)The play tray is super cool. it has two volume settings and an off switch. It lights up and plays music, animals sounds, and piano sounds.The play tray also comes on and off with a snap.the seat is removable so that you may put it into the washing machine.after 3 years of use it looks brand new.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",my 6 month son liked it and enjoys it. We use it 2-3 times a day for not more than 30 mins at a time and he is happy in it. I am pleased with purchase,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I bought this because it was a reputed brand. Chicco says that it will work on carpeted floors - I called customer service and they repeat it. However this was false advertising. It will not work on carpeted floors - even low carpet. When I called customer service to complain, they refused to even consider an exchange for a different product.A walker was not recommended by our pediatrician nor by the official pediatric organizations.",1
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash is a very well made product!!My Grand Daughter loves to walk in it for hours!!For the price I recommend this product Highly!!",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This chicco baby walker is an excellent product i would recommend this walker to anyone.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I was worried about getting a walker because I knew they were seen as dangerous.  But after reading up...the main problem is that babies fall down stairs in them.  I don\'t have stairs so no fear there.  There are also issues with babies hips and learning to walk eventually.  I just make sure he\'s not in it everyday and he\'s not in it all day.  It\'s nice to have though for those times he needs to be a little contained for his safety.  He flys in it.  He does like to crash in to everything (on purpose and not) so make sure you\'re prepared for that.  We first had it when we had carpets which they don\'t really move on but now we have all tile.  I figure if you don\'t have stairs and you\'re a good parent and don\'t think a toy babysits your kid then it\'s great.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","Don\'t even think about buying a different walker, if you do,it means you don\'t love you child.  All the others I have seen or used are cheap pieces of garbage.  My daughter loves it and the breaking system is great.  Chicco makes great products and this is just another great example of that.  BUY IT.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I love this walker, it\'s sturdy and stylish. Rolls perfectly one tile floors  but is a little harder on carpet. I bought it for my 6month old daughter and she loves is, the music is not annoying or too loud, there\'s not toys all in her face and she even knows how to turn it on and off. It is very easy to clean and the dj pad comes on and off with ease so she can have finger foods and her cup on the go. She loves following me through our kitchen and the base is wide enough so she has difficulty reaching things and her 6yr old big brother can\'t knock it over when he pushes her around. This was well worth the money and a all around great walker. You can\'t go wrong with the Chicco brand!!",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This is a great product.  Our grandson loves the buttons and moves easily around the house.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This is by far one of the finer walkers I have seen. I made the rounds to Target, Wal-Mart ect, and they all seemed a bit flimsy and cheaply made. This product is very sturdy and allows my son to turn on a dime. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the center flip toy quit generating noise when he flips it back and forth. I dont mind that much as everything seems to be noise activated anymore but for those who want the noise at every flip, turn, push of a button, be ware. Overall, very well done, very solid, good soft colors, brake pads on all 4 sides, very easy to fold up and take with as we dads seem to bring it all except the kitchen sink. If your looking for a walker, get this one and quit running all over comparing and looking. You wont be disapointed.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I\'ve read good reviews with this walker in different sites, so we are confident that this is a good product fits for our 6months baby boy.The delivery came one day earlier (order on Wednesday night, arrived Friday morning with prime) and I was so excited to look whats inside because the packaging itself has all the pictures and labels.When I assemble it, the instructions are easy to understand and I can do it without help from my husband (which is at work). I could say that the product is well designed including the safety rubbers or stoppers.So I put the baby in, and I see his smiles and excitement whenever he touches and play the front of it that makes different sounds. He also biting it as he is teething stage. :) I can put him in the walker while i can do something else. So helpful for me and fun for the baby.I would recommend this walker to any parents have babies that are showing of readiness to walk (6months up).",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","The Chicco DJ Baby Walker arrived fully assembled, in the folded position, so it was really easy to put together.  Since the walker can collapse, it makes it easy to store in when not in use.  The electronic musical toy that is in the tray area is fanstastic!  You can switch it from playing musical notes to animal sounds to common children\'s melodies.  It also has two sounds volume levels, an on/off stitch and it is detachable from the walker itself.So here is the only downside for us - this walker is for babies 6 months and up (who can sit up on their own) and can accomodate a weight up to to 26 lbs. We bought this for when our four-month old is big enough to sit up on his own and then can use the walker.  HOWEVER, we have a big 4-month old who is already 22 lbs. and is wearing nine month old clothing.  We tried sitting him in the walker the other day just to try it out and his chubby thighs are already starting to get too tight in the seat/leg holes of the walker.Therefore, I would highly recommend that if you have a bigger-size baby, take him/her to a children\'s store that sells the walker to see if they will fit in it. Other than this one item, it is a very nice baby walker for the price.  We checked around and Amazon.com had the best price for the Chicco DJ Baby Walker in Splash.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",We used this product for baby beginning in early infancy. She loved the removable play tray to use during tummy time. It lights up and makes noise when variety of buttons are touched. You can choose to turn off the noise w/the flick of a button. The removable tray also made for easy cleaning. Or to simply have a plain tray on the walker for finger foods. Walker is adjustable to different heights and you can lock the wheels if you choose. It is a very durable product and shows little wear with all the use it received. It also folds up for easy carry in car or to store. Our family loves this product. It was very worth the money I paid for it! We had no saftey issues with this product!,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I love everything about this walker,i bought chicco because my first 2 kids had one and it was great,the toy tray isn\'t in babys face like some walkers ect......that being said the rear wheels are fixed so baby can\'t walk sideways,which is the direction they learn first,then backwards also a problem stearing it...it only goes forward well.plus the \'red\' on the walker is hot pink.Still really durable walkerRecomended age 6-11 months not for walking babies or babies that can\'t sit propped up or have good head control!",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","So this was a gift from Santa to my niece.  I am so glad I read the reviews here, this walker is perfect.  It\'s very sturdy and the wheels are super smooth.  As soon as I sat my niece she got the hang of it in an instant (at 5 months) and she was all over the place.  Now she goes backwards, u-turns, everything and it is definitely because of the wheels it has.  I went to the local baby store to check out the walkers before I decided and even though they didn\'t have this one I saw all the other top reviews here.  They were made out of the cheapest plastic and had hard wheels.  Doesn\'t even compare to this.  Highly highly recommended.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I ordered this for my daughter on Feb 8 and it arrived at our door step on Feb 11th. We were so excited that we put it together right away and put her in it...immediately she figured out that putting her hands on the buttons made sounds and she loved it. Her eyes were filled with wonder as she inquisitively explored the various toys. Everytime we put her in it she\'ll spend the first 5 mins playing with the toys. Once she\'s had enough of it then will she look up and look for us & tries to move around. Because she is only 3.5 months old & her feet don\'t quite touch the floor completely even at the lowest setting so we padded the adjustable component with rolled up cardboard so that the walker sits lower to the floor just a bit more for her feet to reach. (We put a good amount of weight to the test to make sure the card board would not give into the weight since we would not want the walker to all of a sudden fold down while she\'s in it...we eventually replaced the cardboard with a paint stick) We\'ve probably put her in it a hand full of times, and yesterday she actually walked in it!! We couldn\'t believe that a 3.5 months old was roaming the house in this walker. We have hardwood floor on the whole first floor so she\'d slide around very easily, we\'d have to rescue her whenever she runs into the corner of the wall and puts herself in timeout though. But even when that happens she just plays with the toys when she\'s stuck. She loves this and we\'d highly recommend it. 6/18/08 Update: she is now 7 months and is already trying to walk. She climbs everything in sight and grabs hold and stands...I can\'t help but think if she is so advanced for her age because we started her off in this walker very early on and therefore she had a full grasp of the concept of walking and moving around. Needless to say from 3.5-7 months, she enjoyed the walker immensely, and it gave both her and I so~ much freedom. She would fly around the house estatic, and mastered reversing and turning quickly. Now at 7 months and standing, she is not as interested in sitting in this walker so I\'m on a search for something that will continue to give her the independence to explore and learn with little or no help from me...maybe the ""walking wings"" next?!?",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","Our son is 6 months old and loves sitting in this walker playing with the toys on the tray. The toy tray is easily removable, has volume control and you can turn the volume up and down. It won\'t roll on carpet with the stair safety stops installed but we have hardwood floors so its not a problem.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This walker was perfect.  It took our 10 mo old about a minute before she took off.  So sorry we didn\'t have it months ago -  not for carpets.  The busy tray comes off and leaves a nice clear space for eating.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My very difficult to please 8 month old enjoyed this product a great deal. She was one of those babies that never wanted to be put down. She got in it and entertained herself with the lights and sounds, she gained a sence of freedom by gliding from room to room. I wished i had gotten it sooner for her. Now at 14 months, she still loved to push the walker around and play with the activity center. I have a 2 month old and can\'t wait to put him in.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","i love this baby walker.  the only reason i\'m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the lowest position was still a bit too tall for my 6 month old, but within a week he had grown so it didn\'t matter that much.  he loves it.  and i like the fact that the dj table is removable so i can put it on the floor for tummy time.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","The lights and sounds toys are easily removable to use the tray beneath!  There\'s a rather unexciting bead toy on it, but I\'m so glad it\'s there.  Perfect for strapping other toys (like you would for a shopping cart or infant carrier).  I strap his teether to it.  The wheels moves easily, and there are rubber break pads that can be put on the underside as an extra safety feature to prevent tipping if you have a drop.  We do not need them and were happy they are easy to remove bc the slight rise of the floor between rooms would even cause him to break and be unable to move.  A testiment to the effectiveness of them if one does need it.  Very happy so far.  Colors do have pinks and fucia, etc. if that bothers you. For us, hardly an issue.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","We really like it.  It has great colors and entertainment for the price. The only problem is that it doesn\'t move easily on carpet, even with floor pads removed. However, it does move alot easier than most walkers.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",Great for tall babies. Item is of high quality. Makes some really fun sounds while baby zooms around. A good product.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This walker is adorable and everyone wants to know where I got it.  It is colorful and easy to carry around.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My daughter loves this one. I purchased based on other reviews, and I\'m glad I did. I took the brakes/bumpers off the bottom because they\'re a pain. My daughter would get mad when she couldn\'t go from tile to wood and vice versa. Now she can go tile to wood, over a rug, even on carpet (although it is more difficult for her). Great walker. Highly Recommended.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","We got this walker as a gift when our oldest daughter was getting ready to walk. Her younger sister also used it, so it lasts a long time. We never had a problem with it collapsing spontaneously as some are known to do, and the brakes automatically kick in whenever there\'s a change of terrain (like from floor to carpet, or even more importantly, off a step!) The activities on the tray keep baby content, but you can also take it off so it\'s just a plain tray for snacks or something. Like all Chicco products, it is high quality and safe.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I just tried the product today. I am not sure if my 3.5 months old baby has developed strong enough back to sit in it but thought I\'d would try. She loves this walker. For now, I set the seat a bit higher than her height to have her legs danglings because she doesnt have strong enough leg muscles yet. She loves to be pulled and pushed and loves the toy part.The added review after a week of use:I see how other cutomers complain about the toy part breaking. I looked closely why baby\'s drool or spit fall right on to the toy. The design of the seat is made that the seated baby leans toward the toy instead of against the back. This is a bit annoying and thought about returning the product but it just is too muscle hasle. I am trying to add some pads on the seat to see if it works. I hope as the baby grows, she wont lean toward the toy too much. Regardless of the seat design, my baby seems to like it though.",3
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This walker is the shiznite. My son loves this thing! I don\'t care about the colors and all that jazz. I mean, it isn\'t like my son looked at it and was like - that red looks pink, I ain\'t getting into this thing....anyway, the bumper is awesome, and keeps him from smashing his little hands on everything. The activity center is like the love of his life. It has so many sounds/effects that it is hard to keep up with. Since you can remove it and use the tray, he can play with other toys on it as well.The grips make it hard for him to go from our hardwood floors to carpet, so it stops him in his tracks.Although you must monitor him in it for every moment, it has really brought this boy a sense of independence. He chases us, walks to us, follows us, it is pretty sweet.What an awesome product.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I have nothing but great things to say about the walker.  The tray with the noise makes can be detached and is great as a standalone toy.  Attaching the seat did take a little effort but once complete it is very secure..  Outstanding product,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I bought this for my son in December when he was 4 months..some thought i was crazy for putting him in there so young but he LOVES it..he took about 2 weeks of getting used to how to manuever but once he got the hang of it, he no longer sits still..he needs to always be on the move.The walker itself is pretty solid and well built. It folds up nicely for easy storage and transport.The rubber breaks on it work pretty well..seems like a change in floors (even about 1/4 inch) seems to trigger the breaking.But that being said, i still ALWAYS make sure the basement door is closed/locked before i put him in there and i never leave him in the walker when he\'s upstairs onthe second floor.My first floor is one smooth level of hardwood he the walker rolls smoothly, however it gets stuck on the small area rugs we have. I don\'t think it would work well on carpeted flooring especially the really plush kind.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I put this walker together myself and it was fairly easy it just takes some strength. Once together it is the cutest walker I\'ve seen. The play tray has 2 vloumes and my baby finds it very entertaining. He spends more time playing with it then walking but when he does walk it\'s a smooth ride. We have hardwood floors but I don\'t think it would work well on carpet because of the brakes. Overall I would definitely reccommend this walker.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",Such a life saver :) perfect for babies around 6 mnth at the stage were they want to explore world around them,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","First this walker breaks down and can easily be transported, not all walkers do this.  This walker also has more toys compared to other walkers in this price range, further hopefully you will not need it but there is an automatic stop on the bottom if your child nears a step or bump which is reassuring.  The only downfall is that this walker does not bounce, but none in this price range so that.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","We searched online for a few days to find the right walker for our 9 month old daughter.  I read the reviews on this one and even though it was a little more than I wanted to spend, it looked like the best one.  Boy were we right!  We have a laminate floored kitchen and front room and she zooms all over both in this!  The toy tray is so much fun and it comes off so that I can put finger foods on there for her too.  The brakes work great and stop her from changing surfaces so she can\'t get near the stairs! We are first time parents and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a walker!",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","We got this walker as a gift from my parents for our 4-month-old daughter. She LOVES it! She cruises all around the house effortlessly (we have porcelain tile throughout the house). She is 25"" long... so a pretty tall baby and she can reach flat-footed on the lowest setting of this walker. She\'s not too interested in the lights and sounds yet, but I\'m sure that will come in time.This walker has two volume settings and an off switch, but neither of the volume settings is particularly loud, which is great. The rounded corners on the base of the walker helps her maneuver tight spaces and corners without getting ""stuck"" that often, but she does get upset when she snags the edge of an area rug.We haven\'t had to wash the seat yet, but the material is incredibly thick and durable and my husband said it went on easily and should come off just as easily. The color is really gender neutral... some pink, some blue, but lots of green and yellow so we\'ll be able to use it for multiple children. It\'s easy to wipe clean and easy to adjust the height - we really love it and can\'t say enough great things about it! :)You won\'t regret this purchase. Chicco is a great brand!",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My son is 6 months old and teething. So naturally he drools a little bit. Well, the droll falls in between the piano keys on this toy and wouldnt you know it, the circuit card is just below it! So the drool causes the card to freak out and my wife is forced to break the thing open to dry the circuit card out. This happens over and over again. You would think Chicco would not be stupid enough to put a circuit card in such a bad place",1
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My baby loves it, we got it for her when she was 5 months and she had no problem using it at all, the height adjutment is great and it folds up easy for travelling.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I am glad I read reviews before I puchased this walker.  The red is actually hot pink, I love it!!!! My daughter is only 6 months old is 26 inches long and she can reach the ground!! I am very happy with it.  She is used to her activity center and jumper that she can turn 360 degrees in, and for obvious reasons- you cant turn all the way around in this. This makes her a little frustrated but I think when she figures out how to use it, she will love it!!",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My little guy just loves it!!! It\'s easy to control, in two weeks he\'s going everywhere like a pro, which made his exploring way more interesting and independent. It\'s light but at the same time it\'s heavy enough for our guy not to overboard himself. It has variety of different music and notes which are not "" so annoing"" but very exciting for child. I like it\'s bright colors exterior( I think my guy does too). I also liked that it\'s good as for boys and for girls( in case my second child is a girl:)) . Way worth your money, definetely would reccommend to everyone.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My 5 month old loves his walker. It has enough little gadgets on the keyboard to keep him entertained. My 2 year old will still jump in and play in it sometimes. I love it because when I need to get things done around the house, I simply put him in and he\'s content. And the bumpers under the walker are awesome. When we\'re out on our front porch the bumpers keep him from going over the side. He gets to the edge of the porch and that\'s as far as the bumpers will allow him to go. What\'s great is we can take it with us anywhere we go. It collapses so it fits in the car. This is a great walker. Love it!",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","Purchased this for my 6 month old son and he loves it.  The product does look red online and it is really hot pink, but I kept it anyway because it still looks appropriate for a boy. I would purchase this product again.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This walker is my child\'s favorite toy. It plays many different tunes, has fun flashing keys, and parent-friendly volume settings. The walker is well-designed and very sturdy. I also love that the activity tray is easy to remove.If your child is younger than six months or shorter than average, he or she may not be able to reach the floor right away. This walker is lower than Safety First brand walkers and about the same as the Jeep Renegade one. We started our daughter in it at 4 months with shoes on for extra height. She could completely manuever this walker by 5 months, but she is 75th percentile for height.Extremely simple to put together. Did not need tools. Tip: If you do not have any drop-offs or stairs, wait to put the safety bumper things underneath. We had to pull ours off to keep our daughter from getting stuck where the carpet and tile meet. She can\'t walk around on the carpet yet (almost seven months old now) - just not strong enough. Walkers, in general, are not great on plush carpet.Only thing I don\'t love...It folds down flat, but does not lock into that position. So, you have to learn how to carry it to keep it from opening back up. Really not a big issue and the other walkers that we have seen don\'t lock either.Great value for the price! If you\'re considering the Combi Car walker, read the reviews before you spend the money. We\'re so glad that we chose this one.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This walker is great--my baby uses it all the time.  we got it when she was 4 mo. because she ALWAYS wanted to stand, but couldn\'t find a walker that sat low enough.  we rigged it with boxes so she could stand anyway until she got big enough. It\'s pretty easy to clean, too.  I guess my only problem was with the little keyboard.  she has always drooled so much it ended up that two of the ""keys"" stopped working.  Would\'ve been nice if they could\'ve made that part easier to clean, and not so easy for liquids to penetrate.  Aside from that, a good investment.  I\'m sure she\'ll use it for many more months.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","Got this for our 6 month old. Own it over a month now. She still loves it. I get big smiles, as soon as I put her in her walker. The DJ-keyboard is so much fun for her. You can also take it off the walker and just let her play on it, when she is on her tummy. The music never gets old, even if we did hear it like 5000 times so far. I love the adjustable height on this walker also. Very easy to clean too. Great product.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My daughter loves her walker but when she started using this she ran into door frames and walls a lot.  We just put in new baseboards and door frames.  I noticed that the corners of the boards and frames have been chipped from this walker.  Luckily painter\'s caulk will fix the problem but it\'s annoying.  Also when she was about 4 months she started drooling a lot and drool got into the activity tray.  It ruined the tray so I emailed Chicco directly to ask if I can buy a replacement.  They were so nice to send me a new one for free!  The color didn\'t match, but I didn\'t care about that.  Just wanted my daughter to be able to play with it.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",The product was shipped quickly and was easy to assemble.  My son loves it and the activity center keeps him entertained when he is not flying around the house.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I bought this a month ago when my son was 4 months old. He instantly loved it. Now he is able to roll around the kitchen and house and is figuring out the many musical options. I have seen the ones in the stores and by far this is the best one. He once spit up too much on the toy part and it malfunctioned. I took it off and wiped it then let it dry and now it works great. I rotate him from the bumbo seat to this and sometimes the bouncy ( he is getting bored with that one). He gets bored easily and this is the one place I can put him that keeps him safe and happy for some time. The only thing is it is difficult to remove the seat to clean it if there\'s a diaper leak. It is easier to wash it without removing it. I love this walker and it looks fabulous too.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",We are here in US for only the coming three months I was hesistaing about spending 60$ for a walker for my 8 months babythe walker is ok with a very fancy colors but it has some defects in design1- the back wheel are fixed not like the front wheels (I had another walker for my first child and all the wheels are moving in all direction allowing easy moving for the baby)..2-the toys tray cannot be removed easily-- you have to pull it away very strongly  with no set free button.. it also can be got dirty by food and liquid very easily (although we are not feeding the baby on it ) and when I try to clean it stopped making any sounds..,3
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My son has been walking for about a month and we needed something to keep him occupied while strengthening his legs for walking.  It\'s pretty easy to assemble.  Wish it had ""bumpers"" on it so when it hit the wall, furniture, etc, it won\'t make a mark or such a big noise.  Bought table foam guards and applied myself and that seems to work.  Adjusts well for tall babies and lots of noises and lights for him to play with.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This walker is great.  It was easy enough to assemble.  The seat is well cushioned.  The brake pads prevent falls.  The toy tray keeps my baby very entertained with all the lights and sounds.  Overall, a great purchase!  My little one loves cruising around the house in it.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I have just purchased this walker and I am so glad. Not only it looks great, but it\'s extremely comfortable, practical and entertaining and my son is loving it!!! :)",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I bought this walker a week ago for my 3 month old and he absolutely loves it! He has finally gained his independence and I now have time to get other things done. He is still stationary in it and he was tiptoeing so I put a pillow under his feet to help his feet find ground. He loves the keys and the music. Everyone is relieved of carrying him. We are all happy campers!,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My daughter is 5 1/2 month old and loves to stand on her feet all the time. This is the best toy to fit her needs! She smiles, jumps up and down and screams while she\'s playing in this walker. It\'s her favorite toy so far.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My little girl loves this walker!!! For the price and the features it has, it was well worth it! Chicco makes the best stuff for babies. We have bought everything from chicco because they are the best and safest for the price. Amazon by far had the best price for everything!",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","Overall a nice product. Two major things that i don\'t like are:1> the rear wheels don\'t swivel.  It makes getting around more difficult for an infant just learning to use his/her legs.2> The tray in front has a nice snap in entertainment center.  The problem is, there\'s too many nooks and crannies for droll and food to get stuck into.It\'s hard to clean and is not waterproof.  The good thing is that it comes off easily so you can toss it in the trash can like I did.On a positive note, it\'s doing exactly what I bought it for.  My 7 month old is now mobile and exploring the house on his own.The quality of this one is better than all the other ones out there.  This one is also more expensive, but worth it.  I\'d classify this one as barely acceptable.  And all the other ones cheap poorly built junk.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My grandson, who is 4 months old and pretty tall for his age, absolutely loves zipping around the house in his walker.  It\'s very stable and not easily tipped over.  My daughter-in-law thinks its the greatest thing since sliced bread as this allows her to get things done and still keep and eye on the little hurricane.  Glad I purchased it for him and would recommend for either girl or boy.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This is a great walker because it\'s easy to maneuver. My son loves being in it. I love that you could pop off the the musical play thing and it becomes a food tray. That is a plus for me cause it keeps him busy while I get chores done.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I love this! I needed a way for my rambuctious 8 month old to move around but stay safe. She can move around within the area I want her to. I don\'t use the breaks but I will when Ireale my gate down. It works on carpet and great for outside on our driveway. The tray is great and has plenty of things to keep her busy.,5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This product is awesome. The baby loves it, and so do we. Once he figured out he can chase the dog and get around on his own he\'s been unstoppable!The bumpers and brakes keep him where we want him, and it\'s easy to block areas with a simple rug or strategically placed chair.The toy attached to the top is interesting to him, but hard to clean if baby spits up at all. Otherwise, it\'s perfect. The toy is removable so you can take it off to feed or give other toys to play with. This has been some of the best money we\'ve spent. The only loser is the poor dog, who spends a lot of time on the couch these days :)",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","we got this chicco walker when our little girl reached 5 months old.  at the lowest set height it is just right for her--her feet just touch the ground and when she pushes a little with her feet the walker moves forward.  the brake pads on the bottom of the walker do a great job of keeping her from rolling out of control.  she doesn\'t move much, but just enough to keep her entertained. we have hardwood floors and the walker rolls nicely on them without making any marks.the electronic play panel on the walker is great and really keeps her attention.  this walker is the centerpiece of our ""activity circuit"" we put our baby through to keep her occupied as she is very active and constantly needs entertainment.  we also have two swings, a floor play system, and a bouncy chair type thing.  she likes this walker the best.  what can i say, 5 stars. just make sure you turn the play panel off when done using it or you will go through batteries like crazy.",5
Wiggly Giggler Rattles (Set of 6),"Love these wiggly gigglers. Bought my first one 12 years ago for my son\'s 1st Christmas. I was delighted to find them on amazon, they are the perfect gift for infant and toddlers to play with, because they fit perfectly in little hands.",5
Booster Seat Tote,Used it to travel via plane... Roomy enough to hold the booster and child\'s blanket or jacket. Has held up the last two years we used it and still looks like new.,5
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,Hard to manage. Husband won\'t let us use it any more. We may try it again if I can find where my husband has hidden it.,2
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,"I bought 2 trays for my 7 and 4 y/o for a 10 day car trip. The trays are very handy and easy to clean, and the foot rest was great for the 7 y/o (4 y/o didn\'t even come close, we taped a shoe box to it to add height). Because of the negative reviews I told my boys over and over, BE CAREFUL!! with the trays. Well, by day 5 the 4 y/o kicked it hard enough to break it away from the base. He was able to kick it because it was pushed away from his seat while not in active use. When the tray isn\'t in active use, it rests in front of the seat. If you have a kicker, you\'ll need to stress they can\'t. I\'d say my 4 y/o is on the ""normal"" side of the active spectrum, but he IS a 4 y/o, and if you look at the picture, it would appear that is the audience One Step Ahead is producing this for. I\'m planning to try to fix it w/ my hot glue gun since it was glued in the first place, but I don\'t know how that\'ll work.Shoddy, cheap materials and workmanship, plain and simple.So, in short, the reviews are correct. This is a handy item that is great for long car trips--we spent a total of 44 hrs in the car--but buy it with the understanding that you may only get one car trip out of it. For my 4 y/o, it was half a trip. I\'m giving it 3 stars rather than the 2 the quality deserves because it\'s a great item in theory, better than the others trays I see online.",3
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,"This tray is very sturdy due to the solid support bar design.  My 2 year old loves it, and its very handy for snacks or coloring during longer rides.  His legs aren\'t long enough for the foot rest yet, even at the shortest setting, but it should be useful soon.  The table/support bar remove easily from the base when not in use. I use this with the Graco Nautalius which has good arm rests for the tray to sit on, but it should work well without the arm rests too. I have not tried the other attachements yet (table clamp and ground spike.  My only complaint is the price. All the pieces are plastic, though well made.  After shipping, I paid almost $80, which seems more than a little steep. Otherwise, I\'d give it 5 stars.",4
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,"This is well constructed and sturdy.  It\'s very adjustable, so it works lots of ways.  And the tray table slides easily out of the foot rest.  I only have two complaints.  #1, the foot rest doesn\'t attach to anything, it just sits under the car seat, so it always wants to slide out or the car seat slides around on top of it.  I sandwich it between a bath towel to keep it from sliding around.  #2, the foot rest part always slides down.  The way it is supposed to stay put is with downward pressure from the child\'s foot.  But children move around a lot, obviously, and whenever my son lifts his feet up, the foot rest slides down so his feet no longer reach it.Also, I\'m curious as to the safety of this.  I wonder what would happen if I had an accident while using this tray table.  I wish there was information on that.",4
One Step Ahead - Car Seat Protector for Upholstery,"This pad has helped protect the backseat of my envoy for a few months now, and it works great.  I was skeptical with it being so thin, but it works perfectly and prevents my leather from tearing.",5
One Step Ahead - Car Seat Protector for Upholstery,"I bought this to protect a light beige leather interior.  The protector fit reasonably well, and the pouches at the bottom of the protector were nice to store toys in.  I removed the protector after about 5 days of having it in because I was moving the car seat to another car.  When the protector was removed the black dye used on the non-slip base of the protector had transferred to my beige leather seats. Ironically the seat protector had done more damage to the interior than anything that it protected against would have done.  Tried several different leather cleaners and the stains will not go away.  I will most likely have to have the leather re dyed. There were no problems with the interior prior to using this product; it is a late model car and the leather interior is regularly conditioned.In any case if you are planning on using this to protect leather interiors, this is not the product for you.",1
One Step Ahead - Car Seat Protector for Upholstery,I was a bit concerned when I received the seat protector and it did not have any straps or obvious means of keeping it in place.  But I was delighted to find that it stays in place and does its\' job well.  I have been appreciative of the job its\' done when I clean out my van and find all the debris the protector has collected!,5

"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","I am usually a huge fan of Amazon; I\'ve been a Prime member for years and spend thousands of dollars each year shopping through here; and this isn\'t the first time I have bought through their Warehouse Deals. However, my first issue with this product was that I wasn\'t supposed to be charged shipping due to it being an Amazon product and therefore eligible for Prime Shipping; but I was charged the $15.99 shipping fee. The price of the product and shipping fee equaled that of a new product through Amazon Prime, so I emailed and requested a refund of the shipping charge.  I did get that refunded; however, when I got the package the second issue I had was that I only had 7 panels; not 8.  The product description indicates that it would be in the original packaging; and I assumed everything would be in it; but you can tell it\'s not the original box, and even though all of the panels were linked with a snap-cord; there was an entire panel missing. Upon requesting assistance I was told since this was a Warehouse product that I couldn\'t get it exchanged for a like product; nor could I just have them send me a replacement panel; my only options were to accept a partial refund; or ship the whole thing back, get a full refund, and then buy a new product. Since I needed this for a puppy I\'m getting in just a couple of days, I didn\'t have time for that, so I just accepted a partial refund and worked with 6 panels. (It\'s almost impossible to get it to work with an odd number of panels--I tried!!) Will post an update with it once I actually get my puppy and see how well she does with it; but overall I\'m not pleased with the Warehouse Deals department and am not sure I would trust using it again.Overall the product seems sturdy enough, althoug hI need to find a way to bolt one side to my walls so that my puppy can\'t scoot it around; it is rather light and a baby could do the same thing, so carefully watch any baby or animal that is placed within this; if it\'s on a hard surface, it\'s very easy to scoot around and get moved. Or a child could be climbing up the panel and if it scoots forward, the child could lose his/her grip and fall on his/her face or head.",3
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","We have a wood burning stove + firewood + tools (etc) near a wall in a large family room.  It quickly became clear that we needed to block our grand-daughter from flying across the room and getting hurt (she just began to walk and is all over the place).  I purchased the 8-panel unit and configured it in a U formation so that the fence completely encloses the stove and wood at a safe distance.  The U shape terminates on a wall and I\'m planning to devise some simple anchor to fix the contact point so it can\'t be easily moved (but easily removed).  Maybe something as simple as a strip of velcro, an end screwed to the wall, and strapped around the fence where it touches the wall.  (I moved the gate in the front where I can enter the enclosure and access the stove and firewood with ease).  So far this configuration works very well.  She\'s gone up to the fence but it\'s rigid enough and won\'t tip over (even without the wall anchors).  The fence is far enough from the stove that there\'s no danger at all.  During warmer weather I can see using this outdoors as a &#34;natural grass&#34; play pen--at least for a short time until she wants out.  The 8-panel unit was only a few dollars more than the 6-panel unit and is a good value.A couple of picky points. The knobs that secure the hinges at a specified angle are difficult to hand tighten and loosen.  Even when turned counter-clockwise (loosened), the hinges were stiff and the panels difficult to bend.  I didn\'t see how to remove the knobs in the instruction booklet (which isn\'t very good). It sort of explains that you need to bend a panel to remove it from the hinge, but an illustration of doing this would have been useful.  I needed to move the gate to a mid-point (not at the end where it comes from the factory).  It was difficult removing the knob--you\'d think that you could just turn it counter-clockwise and it would come off, but it requires it to be hand loosened then pried off with a screwdriver or other tool.  The other issue I have is that the fence sits on a hard-wood floor and can slip and slide.  I thought I read somewhere that the fence comes with rubber pads, but mine didn\'t.  I\'ve ordered some high friction adhesive pads to affix on the bottom.  These should help stabilize the fence on the floor.Overall a good product for the price, and it solved a difficult problem.",4
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","This product was exactly what I wanted. It is tall enough, strong enough, and large enough. It even tightens for added safety. It is terrific. Strong enough for a puppy too.",5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","really big when you put all the pieces together. My 10m old could figure out how to climb up the sides a little, but only when barefoot. Easy to move, a little heavy but totally worth it.",4
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","8 panel was perfect for my 9 months old. When i need to do something i put my daughter in the cage with some toys and she will be playing alone while i do my cooking, chatting or taking shower.  So much relief for me.Don\'t buy 6 panel because it will be very small space for baby\'s to play. I did the right thing by choosing the 8 panel . Very light , folds perfect and i can adjust in a second. Since it is very light it can collapse easily though. Overall everything is ok.",4
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","This is being used as a dog pen and is wonderful, my dog is only 5 pounds. Very easy to use and great price!",5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan",This gate is sturdier than I expected. It is also more compact and easier to transport than I first imagined. Though a little heavy it is well worth the purchase.  I also like that you can buy extra panels to make it bigger. My nephew is loving it!!,5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","I use it on my deck when I take the Day Care children our to play.... the small one\'s stay on the deck with me, as to not get hurt with the swings.  The Playyard extended wide enough that I can keep the little ones in one place to play... and not in the driveway...I was looking for something that would extend as wide as the deck.... thank you... Dianne",5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","Have 2 dogs, 9lbs & 11lbs, One afraid to go out, loves security of gate.  Other dog loves to be out all day, but needs supervision.  Using as gate to block off part of yard.  So far, very good!",4
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan",I like it. its easy to move and that can be a problem. I use it for puppies and it makes a great addition to my kennel,5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","We picked this up for our 5 month old that started to craw, we live in a town home so there\'s lots of stairs,  we use it to gate off half of our main floor so he cant reach any of the stairs.  Due to the size of the gate,  unless you have something supporting it,  it can feel a bit flimsy,  however that\'s something you cannot fix with a gate like this.  Bottom line,  our son pulls himself up using it and stands along side of it with no issues.  I trust it and for the price I\'m very happy with it.",5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan",I bought the 8 side panels and it works great! Very easy to add or subtract panels if needed. Not to flimsy! Would highly recommend!,5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","I chose this fence because it was the tallest, at 30 inches, which I thought would prevent my son from climbing. However, I couldn\'t tell from the photo that the horizontal bar projects outward some and therefore serves as a step for little ones to climb over the top. I think without that horizontal bar, the fence would have served its purpose, but within a week and a half of using it, my 19 month old son figured out how to climb over the top. It now sits folded behind the couch. I am returning it and in the process of finding a replacement. I believe I saw similar ones on Amazon a couple days ago that do not have the horizontal bar, but they may be 23 inches high.",1
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","Not sure what\'s going on with the price problems others are having, we bought this straight from One Step Ahead\'s website and it came out around $100 all told, shipped in a HUGE box though.It is a great play yard for the price though. The plastic ""mesh"" (middle of each gate piece) is a little flimsy, but the overall frame of each segment piece is VERY strong. Set in the proper octagonal shape, its very hard to tip over or move unless baby is determined and able to throw their weight at it hard. Once assembled, baby has more than enough room to roam and play within, but I can\'t see having twins in this set. Then again, my one is a mover and shaker, so she found even this gate system small once she grew bigger. Stopped using after her first birthday because she learned to climb and tried to climb using the ""mesh"" on each segment piece. Once she put on some weight (18+ lbs or so) she could also easily push the system out of its octagonal shape thus ruining the stability of the entire system. Usage highly depends on your little one\'s size and shape in my opinion. My daughter just hated the idea of being ""contained"" after a while, so that is why she tried to climb and push the gates all out of whack.The latch for the main gate piece is a little tricky to learn at first, but we got the hang of it after a few tries.Overall, this particular type of product is a good idea for use, if you have the room to place it. Works much better than a play yard. Great for little ones just starting to learn to walk, when you want a decently sized, safe place for them to roam. It is definitely worth its cost in the long run.",4
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","Was easy enough to assemble and big enough with 6 panels but so happy to have the extra 2 to grow with. It\'s nice to have an area of the house designated as a baby safe zone, as I live with my in-laws and their 13yr old son.",5
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","I read some reviews prior to ordering this and they were both positive & negative. I have found it worked perfect for our use of an apartment enclosed patio off the spare bedroom. We have two small dogs that like to be outside, we zip tied the panels to the privacy fence and it gives them a place to play. Before we had a 21 inch space where they could get out now they are safe. Great product for my use!",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"So I have been using medela bottles to pump and store only to find out that their bottles contain BPS! If you don\'t know what BPS is, look it up. It is just as bad if not worse than BPA! I am royally pissed that I have been contaminating my precious milk because of this unethical company! Many products that claim to be BPA free are NOT BPS free and they only substitute BPA for BPS. THEY\'RE ALL IN THE GARBAGE NOW WHERE THEY BELONG AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SWITCHED TO GLASS. SHAME ON YOU MEDELA!",1
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"The bottes came fast, very util and practical. Easy connect other medela products, then you can change botle to Medela Special Needs, : )",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),I had a Medela swing pump for the the first 15 months of my daughter\'s life. It finally died but up until then I was very impressed by Medela\'s products. I really like this set. It is a bit costly but the product lasts and comes with nipples and lids for pumping. It was so great to have both options. Sometimes I pumped straight into the bottle she would have when I went to work. Other times I would pump and save milk while at work.The only thing I dislike about the bottles is after the first cleaning they always have spots on them. The product has a good lifetime and the nipples do not discolor or crack.I highly recommend these bottles as my exclusively breastfed baby preferred them over any other brand.,4
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"Serves it purpose. I didn\'t realize it was for 4 months old, brought it for my newborn.It is better if they mentioned it in the package.",3
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),I like it is produc very good,5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"I bought this set when I just needed extra nipples, collars, and caps because it was cheaper than buying those separately and now I have extra bottles!  I view the \'bubbles\' as a good thing; it means my son isn\'t sucking all that air in; it also encourages a brief break in the middle of feeding.  I do prefer the taller Gerber bottles I own for feeding (and they are compatible with the Medela nipples).  One minor con is that Medela does not have 6-month nipple for this bottle. I haven\'t had any problems with collars cracking and my wife accuses me of always tightening bottles, lids, etc. too tight so I would think that I would have cracked one by now if this were a significant issue!",4
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"I have a Medela breast pump, and this feeding and storage set is so helpful and easy to use!",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),Very nice bottle set though they were not as pictured. I received the older style but they are the same size and I didn\'t want to take the time to exchange them for the bottles that are pictured even though I liked that design better. What counted was the bottles themselves and the need for the bigger size so overall happy with them.,4
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"I love the bottles. I really do. They are easy to clean. However, the nipples and rings seemed to have a problem with leaking out quite often. We actually replaced the nipples and rings to fix the problem.",4
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),This product is BPA Free along with all Medela stuff.  Thank You Medela!  However my only grip is this nipple is too small for my 4 month old.  The whole nipple fits in her mouth and she\'s right up to the plastic yellow rim. So this would be great for newbies but not when older.  Born Free is the best BPA Free bottle out there for older babies.,3
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),Like Medela very much. Very easy to hold bottle. Sterilizes without any harm to bottle. I have a pump too. Medela pump was is working non stop for seven month.,5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"I love the product, but the box came opened and was missing pieces. I was very unhappy since I had to wait over a week for it to even ship! The price is great as it\'s $12-$15 at stores, but I should have bought it there instead of having to deal with sending it back.",1
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"I love the larger size of these bottles.  They screw right onto my medela hand pump and can easily be stored for later use.  These bottles are BPA free.  It surprised me how flexible the plastic was on these bottles compared to the bottles that I used for my first son, but they are still durable.  My 8 oz bottles came with medium flow nipples which were a bit to fast for my 4 month old but we just bought some slow flow nipples to switch out and it works wonderfully.  He eats like a champ from these bottles and we haven\'t had any issues going between breast feeding and using these bottles.",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"Excellent storage bottles (and BPA free), but wish you could purchase these without the nipples and nipple caps which we did not want or need.",4
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),I got these bottles along with other bottles to try which one is best..Medela bottles are not only lasting but also great quality of nipples and ease to mix formula without spilling it. Travelling with these bottles is added advantage. As per my experience Medela is the best in market. My baby used it whole year from her day 1. Surely recommend it to all mothers.,5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"These bottles worked well until my 11 month old began tossing them once she was finished eating.  She\'s cracked four rings in the last month.  Unfortunately, replacement rings cost $3 a piece.  Medela (correctly) touts their bottles as shatterproof.  I wish they would make the rings the same.",4
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"In less than 12 hours, the price of the bottles went up 3 dollars. Then, when I added the items to my cart, it went down by 50 cents. What\'s up with this?! I\'m not buying from ANB BABY, at this point, ""just because"" (and, of course, other sellers offer the same price). What, Medela baby bottles now follow Wall Street early morning fluctuations?!",1
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"My baby nursed until he was 4 months and when it was time for me to go back for work I started pumping breast milk for him. He took this bottles with no problems, although he was surprised his milk came this way :) but he moved from bottles to nursing with no problems. The nipple in this set is medium flow but i use a slow flow from another set so he has to work on this like with nursing which is very important.I\'ve only received one cap in mine but i think there should be three caps. Also, the bottles don\'t look exactly like the pictures. The line for the measurements is straight which I prefer, makes it easier to see how much is in the bottle.These bottles work with my pump in style Medela pump and all the caps work with the 5 oz. bottles as well.",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),Bad quality and the nipples r bad the milk flow will stop coz they get stuck u have to pull the bottle out from baby moth then let some air inside then baby will refuse yo eat,1
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"just on time, and was what was expected, is excellent quality product. recommend this product 100%, this product is wonderful.",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"Medela is a company that promotes breastfeeding...or at least I would assume that, based on their major products being breast pumps.Breast fed babies rarely need to eat more than 4 oz at one time, so why make 8 oz bottles?!  I bought this set before I really understood that, and promptly returned them.  The bottles themselves were fine, except that I should never need to buy them anyway.",3
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"These bottles work well with the Medela pump and have nice caps, but the low flow nipple is too much for our little guy when we try to use them for feeding. He\'s only three weeks old and I\'m sure he\'ll be able to handle them someday, but right now, the ThinkBaby bottles we have seem to work well with him at this stage.",2
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"For the price, these are good bottles.  I appreciate that this set came with the medium flow nipples, as buying them separate would\'ve been more expensive.",4
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),Great set of bottles. We used these with our oldest daughter and would not choose anything else for the second.,5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"connects directly to the pumping components so you can pump and feed without dirtying another bottle. We\'ve used them for 4 months (just replaced the identical set after 3 months per our pediatrician) and we\'ve never had a leak. We\'ve tried almost every bottle out there and almost all of them leak for some reason. These, blissfully, do not.",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),I love these Medela bottles. I can pump right into them and be ready to go for the next day. Compact and very handy.,5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"My daughter makes a huge mess when eating, but this bottle has worked the best for her. The narrower nipple allows her to get a better seal than some of the others. The ounce marker",4
